Since the MOS FET is a voltage control type and is a wide band element, it has the characteristics that it prevents the occurrence of notching distortion that affects the sound quality in the high frequency range, and that it does not require power supply from the previous stage. Therefore, the load on the front stage becomes lighter, it is easy to select an element with excellent characteristics for the drive stage, and we have succeeded in improving the characteristics of the entire power amplifier section.\r\nMoreover, since the last stage is a wide band, a wide band in the NF loop is possible, and the generation of harmful TIM as dynamic distortion is prevented.\r\nFurthermore, the input stage is a FET buffer input, and the next is a push-pull configuration for differential amplification, so that all amplification stages have a push-pull configuration.\r\nMoreover, the direct connection amplifier which does not have an input capacitor is constituted by measuring the stability by adopting the DC servo system by IC.\r\n\r\nThe high-level amplifier part of the preamplifier has a configuration in which the input is a buffer with dual FETs, the next stage is differential amplification with an operational amplifier, and the final stage is wideband complementary push-pull.\r\nWhile eliminating the input capacitor by FET input, the coupling capacitor of the output is also removed by the DC servo system, and the complete direct connection circuit is constructed from input to output.\r\n\r\nIn the equalizer amplifier section, the input is composed of a FET buffer and the direct coupling input from which the coupling capacitor is removed is formed. When the mirror effect occurs at this stage, the frequency characteristic of the amplifier itself changes due to the inductance of the cartridge and the stray capacity, and the original sound quality of the cartridge is distorted. To prevent this, the E-301 uses a Miller effect canceling circuit in combination with the FET input.\r\nNext to the FET, it passes through differential amplification and is amplified by Darlington, and the final stage is composed of a complementary push-pull circuit.\r\nThe whole circuit is stabilized by the DC servo system, the output capacitor is also removed, and it is constituted by the complete direct connection system from DISC(MM) to the output stage of the power amplifier.\r\nMoreover, the disk impedance switch which switches the input impedance at the time of MM is carried.\r\n\r\nThe head amplifier part has an ICL direct connection type differential push-pull with no capacitor input, and the output stage has a complete push-pull configuration of complementary push-pull.

uses a method in which relays are installed where switching is necessary and controlled electronically by a logic circuit.\r\nThis relay uses a sealed type with cross-bar twin silver-palladium gold-plated contacts.\r\n\r\nIt has 8 input terminals and 2 balance terminals.\r\nIn addition, the built-in recording selector is independent of the input selector, so you can record FM broadcasts while listening to CDs.\r\nIt is also equipped with a copy switch that allows independent dubbing between sound recorders.\r\n\r\nIt is equipped with separate input / output terminals that can be used as an independent amplifier by electrically separating the preamplifier and the power amplifier.\r\n\r\nFor tone control, we have developed an additive active filter method which is also used in graphic equalizers.\r\nIn this method, the original flat signal passes straight through, another characteristic is created as necessary, and the signal is adjusted from the flat signal.\r\n\r\nEquipped with a peak power meter of logarithmic compression peak indication type.\r\n\r\nIt includes a speaker selector that switches between two pairs of speakers, a mode switch that mixes the left and right sounds, a subsonic filter that cuts out the harmful ultra-low noise of analog disks, and a compensator that enhances the low-sound feel when the volume is low.\r\n\r\nThe

pre-main amplifier is based on the E-305 and has been polished to a higher perfection.\r\n\r\nBased on the development technology that ACPHASE has developed over many years, we have reconsidered the circuit and construction to pursue the same quality as a separate amplifier.\r\n\r\nIn the power amplifier section, an N-channel power MOS FET and a P-channel power MOS are applied to the element of the output stage.\r\nThree FETs are connected in parallel to each other.\r\nThe parallel use of power MOS FETs makes it possible to extract sufficient power for low impedance.\r\n\r\nThe driver stage that drives the power MOS FET uses a cascode connection.\r\nBy suppressing the phase rotation as small as possible and reducing the voltage applied to the input part of the cascode stage, the performance of the element is drawn out, resulting in a wide band and wide linearity and power MOS.\r\nDriving to the FET is ideal.\r\nAccuPhase's unique complimentary service push-pull circuit is used for the input, and the input FET is cascode-connected.\r\n\r\nAll unit amplifiers for analog disk, high level, and power are connected by direct connection.\r\nEach unit amplifier is stabilized by applying a strong DC servo to suppress DC drift.\r\n\r\nA newly developed volume regulator is used.\r\nThe input level adjuster uses a mirror-finished resistor with low distortion. Depending on the mirror surface, it has excellent abrasion resistance. Moreover, there is no grease or anything that impairs sound quality between the brush and the resistor.\r\nIn addition, while the general volume structure has a fixed stator resistor and the brush is a slider, the E-305V attenuator has a structure in which the resistor rotates and the brush part is fixed and directly comes out as a terminal. This reduces the number of metal joints from five to three to improve sound quality.\r\nThis volume regulator is equipped with a gear mechanism and an electric motor for remote control.\r\n\r\nLogic relay control is used to switch small signals such as the input selector.\r\nBy using a sealed relay containing nitrogen gas, aging is prevented, and wiring is possible at the shortest distance because it can be located locally.\r\nThis relay uses a gold-plated crossbar twin structure for the communication industry.\r\n\r\nComes with an input source and volume adjustable remote control.\r\nSince the input selector switches relays electronically, this logic circuit is controlled by the commander so that there is no degradation in sound quality. In addition, the volume is adjusted by using a volume adjuster with a motor. The motor is magnetically shielded by silicon steel to minimize noise.\r\nA micro computer is used for remote control demodulation.\r\n\r\nIt is equipped with an equalizer amplifier taking into consideration the characteristics of each cartridge of MM type and MC type.\r\nConsidering that the output voltage and output impedance of the MM cartridge are high at the time of MM input, it is composed of FET elements which can maintain post-input impedance over the whole frequency band.\r\nSince the MC input receives very small signals with low impedance, a differential input circuit with low-noise elements is constructed to achieve low impedance of the NFB loop, enabling low-noise reproduction.\r\n\r\nThe preamp section and power amplifier section are separated, and a changeover switch and input / output terminals are mounted for use as an independent amplifier.\r\n\r\nIt uses the addition type active filter tone control used in full-fledged graphic equalizers.\r\nIt has a structure that emphasizes sound quality by allowing the original signal to pass straight through and adding or subtracting additional characteristics to the signal as needed.\r\n\r\nBy using a dedicated power supply and a constant voltage circuit for each of the preamplifier and power amplifier, interference through the power supply is prevented.\r\nTo reduce the negative effects of electrostatic coupling and electromagnetic induction, we have taken measures such as improving the internal structure and arrangement.\r\n\r\nEight inputs and two tape recorder inputs are available. Of these, two balance inputs, CD and Line, are available.\r\n\r\nThe output of the power amplifier can be monitored with a large power meter.\r\nThe meter uses a logarithmic compression type so that you can see a wide dynamic range at once.\r\n\r\nYou can switch between two A / B speakers, or you can connect a bi-wired speaker with an A + B position where the two speakers are connected in parallel, with separate networks for bass and treble.","Propierties":{"$id":"50","Type":"Integrated Stereo Pre-Main Amplifier","continuous average output (both channel operation,\r\n20 Hz ~ 20 kHz, Distortion Factor 0.02%)":"4 ohm load : 180W/ch\r\n8 ohm load : 130W/ch","Total Harmonic Distortion Factor (both channel operation)":"0.02% (4 to 16 ohm load, 0.25W to continuous output, 20 hz to 20 khz)","IM Distortion Factor":"0.01%","Frequency Response":"Main Amp Input: 20 Hz ~ 20000 Hz + 0 -0.2 dB at rated output\r\n0.5 Hz ~ 150000 Hz + 0 -3.0 dB at 1W Output High Level Input: 20 Hz to 20000 Hz + 0 -0.2 dB at rated output Low Level Input: 20 Hz to 20000 Hz + 0.2 -0.5 dB at rated output","Damping factor":"100 (8 ohm load, 50 Hz)","Rated Input / Input Impedance":"Input Sensitivity  Impedance  At rated output  EIA at 1W output AD Input(MC):0.123mV0.01mV 100 ω AD Input(MM):4.3mV0.34mV 47k Ω High Level Input:125mV10.9mV 20k Ω Balanced Input:125mV10.9mV 40k Ω Main Amp Input:1.28V111mV 20k Ω","Rated Output / Output Impedance":"Pre Output : 1.28V/200 Ω\r\nTape Rec Output : 125mV/200 Ω (from AD)\r\nHeadphones : 0.4 v, Applicable Impedance 4 ~ 100 Ω","Gain":"Main Input → Output : 28 dB\r\nHigh Level Input → Pre Output : 20 dB\r\nAD Input (MM) → Tape Rec Output : 30 dB\r\nAD Input (MC) → Tape Rec Output : 60 dB","S/N, input conversion noise":"Input Short A-Compensation EIA S/N S/N at rated input  Input Conversion Noise Main Amp Input:124dB-121dBV102dBHigh Level Input:110dB-128dBV83dBBalanced Input:90dB-108dBV82dBAD Input(MM):88dB-137dBV80dBAD Input(MC):72dB-150dBV80dB","Tone Controls":"Bass : turnover frequency 300 Hz, ± 10 dB (50 Hz)\r\nTreble : Turnover frequency 3 kHz, ± 10 dB (20 kHz)","Subsonic Filter":"17 Hz, -12dB/oct","Attenuator":"-20dB","Power Meter":"Logarithmic Compression Peak Level Display\r\nDirect reading of output at dB scale and 8 Ω load","Load Impedance":"4-16 ω","Semiconductors used":"Transistors : 59\r\nFET : 22\r\nIC : 24 pcs\r\nDiodes : 69","Power Supply":"100V/117V/220V/240V, 50Hz/60Hz\r\nDC 3V","Power Consumption":"No Input : 65W\r\nElectrical Appliance and Material Control Law : 310W\r\n8 Ω load at rated output : 490W","External Dimensions":"475 mm wide x 170 mm high x 418 mm deep","Weight":"22.7kg\r\n140g (including dry batteries)","Remote Control Method":"Infrared Pulse Method","Dry Battery":"SUM-3 (IEC designation R6) 2 pieces","Maximum External Dimensions":"64 mm wide x 149 mm high x 18 mm deep"},"CategoryId":23,"Category":{"$ref":"27"},"CompanyId":2,"Company":{"$ref":"30"}},{"$id":"51","Id":20,"Name":"E-306","Link":"https://audio-database.com/Accuphase-kensonic/amp/E-306-e.html","PictureLink":"https://audio-database.com/Accuphase-kensonic/amp/same-306.JPG","Description":"A pre-main amplifier with a current feedback amplifier circuit in the power amplifier section.\r\n\r\nThe amplifier uses a current feedback type amplifier circuit that feeds back the output signal in the form of a current.\r\nThe principle is that a current is detected by lowering the impedance of the input terminal on the feedback side, and the current is converted into I-V by a transimpedance amplifier to produce an output signal. Since the impedance of the feedback input is extremely low, phase rotation is less likely to occur.\r\nSince there is almost no need for phase compensation, it has excellent dynamic characteristics such as start-up and natural energy response.\r\nIn addition, high power is obtained by using a parallel audio power transistor for the output element, which has excellent characteristics such as frequency characteristics, linearity of current amplification factor and switching.\r\n\r\nThe power supply is equipped with a large power transformer with a high power capacity of approximately 500 VA and a large filter capacitor of 22,000 μ Fx2.\r\n\r\nThe line amplifier is composed of discrete parts.

This circuit has excellent linearity and achieves the best distortion rate with a small amount of NFB. As a result, TIM (transient intermodulation) distortion, which is one of the causes of sound quality degradation, is improved.\r\nAll of the unit amplifiers (head amp, equalizer amp, high-level amp and headphone amp) are DC-type. The condenser for cutting DC of the NF loop, which requires a large capacity, is removed. Moreover, the input condenser is removed, and the ICL method is used to improve sound quality.\r\n\r\nThe head amplifier has an input differential push-pull configuration. It uses a specially developed RET (ring emitter transistor) for small signals, contributing to improved sound quality. In addition, the output impedance is reduced by driving the output stage with a large current, and the input conversion noise is reduced by setting the feedback voltage dividing resistance low.\r\nIn addition, the head amplifier is modularized so that it can operate stably even in temperature change without humidity.\r\n\r\nThe equalizer amplifier consists of symmetrical push-pull amplification stages through the FET buffer of the input.\r\nThe EQ uses RET (Ring-Emitter Transistor) for high-frequency power amplification, A class large current drive for low output impedance, and low feedback voltage dividing resistance.

It is excellent in the ability to remove the noise component of advisory mode.\r\nThe C-250 basically consists of three differential amplifiers. When balanced, the signals from the + - inputs of Amp 1 are amplified and then fed to Amp 2 and Amp 3. These two amplifiers are connected to each other by feeding their outputs back to the other side. They transmit + - symmetric signals with low impedance.\r\nThis circuit is an ideal circuit system in which the + - symmetric signal is floated from the ground. Even if one side of the output is grounded, both amplifiers are differential and the output voltage does not change. Therefore, in a normal unbalanced connection, either input or output is simply connected to the ground line.\r\n\r\nThe main circuit of the C-250 consists of a total of 6 unit left and right amplifiers including a line amplifier, a balanced input / output amplifier and a balanced output amplifier, and is located on the motherboard.\r\nIn order to prevent mutual interference between these unit amplifiers, each unit amplifier is surrounded by a thick extruded aluminum material, and the structure is strong against resonance due to external vibration.\r\n\r\nThe power supply section has a completely monaural configuration with independent power transformers, left and right filters and capacitors to eliminate crosstalk between channels and prevent mutual interference between amplifiers.\r\n\r\nThe volume regulator uses a resistor with a particularly low distortion factor. This resistor is mirror-finished and has low contact resistance and excellent abrasion resistance.\r\nThe brush that contacts the resistor is a gold-plated multi-contact type. It is integrated with the external terminal to eliminate the metal joint surface and reduce the strain caused by contact of different metals.\r\nIn addition, the rotation method is not a method in which the brush rotates, but a structure in which the resistor rotates by fixing the brush is adopted. This greatly reduces the internal contact points and eliminates the need for contact grease, improving durability.\r\n\r\nThe input selector uses AccuPhase's original logic relay control system that uses a sealed type relay containing nitrogen gas for the communication industry.\r\nIn this system, relays are installed where switching is necessary and controlled electronically by logic circuits.

The mirror-finished resistor has good distortion characteristics and excellent wear resistance. In addition, there is no grease or anything that impairs sound quality between the brush and the resistor.\r\nIn addition, unlike the general volume structure, the resistor rotates and the brush part is fixed and directly exposed as a terminal.

Balanced transmission is a method of simultaneously transmitting positive and negative symmetrical signals whose phases are inverted with each other. It has an excellent ability to eliminate common-mode noise components.\r\nThe C-280V line amplifier basically consists of three differential amplifiers for balanced transmission. amp1 is used as an input, and amp2 and amp3 are used as outputs. The signals from both + - inputs of amp1 are amplified and then input to the following amp2 and amp3. These two amplifiers feed back their outputs to the other side. They transmit a + - symmetric signal with low impedance.\r\nFor unbalanced connections, simply connect the terminals on either side of the input / output side to the ground line.\r\n\r\nThe C-270V is equipped with a line amplifier for unbalanced output and a line amplifier for balanced output separately.\r\nThe line amplifier for unbalanced output has an all-FET constant-current load cascode bootstrap source follower at the input, which is amplified by a symmetrical balanced differential push-pull emitter-grounded circuit with a high in-phase rejection ratio, and a symmetrical cascode push-pull + emitter-follower circuit at the output.\r\nIn the line amplifier for balanced output, the balanced output circuit is added to the dedicated input circuit like the unbalanced output amplifier. This output circuit is similar to the C-280V, and the balanced output is composed by bridge feedback which applies feedback to the opposite amplifier of inverted amplifier and non-inverted amplifier respectively. Both inverted and non-inverted outputs are completely separated from the ground.\r\nAll of these unit amplifiers are DC-servo for both input and output, and no capacitor is inserted to cut DC.\r\n\r\nThe power supply section has a completely monophonic configuration with independent transformers and filter capacitors on the left and right sides. In addition, all unit amplifiers are equipped with a broadband low-impedance power supply to prevent mutual interference between amplifiers.\r\n\r\nFor the volume that has a large impact on sound quality, a 4-linked volume regulator with CP (conductive plastic) elements is used.\r\nThe CP element used in the studio is used for the resistor. After the resistor element is printed, it is molded under high temperature pressure, and the surface of the element is finished into a mirror surface to achieve low contact resistance and low distortion.\r\nThe brush that contacts the resistor is a gold-plated multi-contact type. It is integrated with the external terminal to eliminate the metal contact surface and reduce the strain caused by contact of different metals.\r\nIn addition, the rotation method has a structure in which the resistor rotates instead of the method in which the brush rotates. This greatly reduces internal contact points, eliminates the need for contact grease, and improves durability.\r\nThe casing of the sound quality adjuster is an 8 mm diameter thick brass shaft supported by an aluminum cutting bearing, and four elements are each housed in a high-precision aluminum cutting case to provide a complete shield to improve sound quality.\r\nThe variable method is a continuously variable type with a tracking error of less than 0.5 dB measured at a position of -60dB.\r\n\r\nA logic relay control circuit is used to switch the input signal.\r\nIn this system, highly reliable relays are installed in each local area, and the timing of switching is controlled by a logic circuit, thus preventing wiring and sound quality degradation.\r\nThe relay uses a completely sealed structure filled with nitrogen gas, which was developed especially for audio and communication equipment. The gold and silver-palladium alloy cross-bar twin system for the contacts that affect sound quality realizes low contact resistance and high durability.\r\n\r\nThe C-270V consists of a line amplifier for unbalanced output and a line amplifier for balanced output separated into two units. Each unit amplifier is paired with a printed circuit board and a local area power supply, which is less susceptible to interference, and housed in a thick aluminum housing.\r\nThey are mounted on a large motherboard for electrical stability and serviceability, and are mounted on an 8-mm aluminum chassis to prevent electrical and mechanical interference.\r\n\r\nEquipped with a dedicated direct-coupled headphone amplifier.\r\n\r\nThe input / output jack is a characteristic jack with rhodium plating for excellent durability.\r\n\r\nEquipped with a 3-step attenuator.\r\n\r\nEquipped with left and right independent attenuator level control for perfect channel balance and control of orientation in any listening position.

By using A class push-pull, linearity and distortion characteristics are further improved, and element characteristics before NFB is applied are improved.\r\n\r\nThe basic circuit configuration of the unit amplifier is the same as that of the head amplifier, equalizer amplifier, and high-level amplifier. It is basically 3-stage amplification. It consists of 2 stages of input cascode push-pull differential amplification with 8 elements and 2 stages of cascode push-pull amplification with 4 elements.\r\nIn addition, it is equipped with an IC-based DC servo circuit that detects DC generated at the output and returns it to the input to prevent DC drift.

This increases the corona discharge starting voltage and allows the signal to pass stably even under high voltage pulses. The lead wire, which affects sound quality, is connected directly to the edge of the silver film to prevent degradation.\r\n\r\nThe head amplifier for the MC cartridge uses a special flat amplifier inserted in front of the equalizer amplifier.\r\nA low-noise element is used for the input circuit and at the same time, the impedance of the NFB loop is reduced to greatly reduce resistance noise. In order to avoid the influence of noise generated by the DC servo, feedback is not directly to the - side of the differential amplifier, but is instead fed back to the base of the low-current source, thus reducing the influence of servo noise.\r\n\r\nTo support various MC cartridges, the MC input impedance can be switched to 3 stages.\r\nIt also includes a gain selector switch for low power MC cartridges.\r\n\r\nEquipped with 600 Ω balanced output terminal.\r\n\r\nThe six unit amplifiers for left and right channels and the constant voltage power supply are housed in a thick aluminum housing.\r\nThe board is fixed with screws, and the output element of class A amplifier and the element of constant voltage power supply are fixed in close contact with the housing for heat dissipation, preventing resonance due to induction and vibration.\r\n\r\nTwo tape recorders can be connected for recording, playback and monitoring.\r\n\r\nEquipped with a 3-step rotary attenuator, it can be switched between -20dB, -30dB and - ∞.\r\n\r\nEquipped with left and right independent attenuator level control.\r\nAccurate adjustment is possible in 0.5 dB steps from 0 to -6dB, and then in 1 dB steps up to -14dB.\r\n\r\nEquipped with a subsonic filter that cuts only subsonic noise of 10 hz or less.\r\n\r\nA compensator replaces the tone control.\r\nThe frequency response is automatically corrected according to the position of the volume, and two types of response can be selected with the switch.\r\n\r\nUsing a high-grade rhodium plated input / output jack, it has excellent durability with a hardness of 1 μ m thickness that can withstand 100 million sliding cycles.\r\n\r\nIt uses a front panel of gold-like scratch hairline and Persimmon wood case.","Propierties":{"$id":"107","Type":"Stereo Preamplifier","Frequency Response":"Tuner, Line, Tape Play :  1.0 Hz to 500 kHz + 0 -3.0 dB\r\n20 Hz ~ 20 kHz + 0 -0.2 dB  Disc : 20 Hz-20 kHz ± 0.2 dB","Total Harmonic Distortion Factor (New IHF)":"0.005% (20 Hz to 20 kHz at all input terminals)","Input Sensitivity / Impedance  (Rated Output / New IHF Output 0.5 v)":"Disc (Head amp off) MM : 2.0mV/0.5mV/47k Ω\r\nDisc (Head amp + 26 dB) : 0.1mV/0.025mV/10 Ω, 30 Ω, 100 Ω\r\nDisc (Head amp + 32 dB) : 0.05mV/0.0125mV/10 Ω, 30 Ω, 100 Ω\r\nTuner, Line, Tape Play : 126mV/31.5mV/20k Ω","Rated Output / Impedance":"Output (unbalanced) : 2.0V/1.0 ohm\r\nOutput (balanced) : 2.0V/600 ohm\r\nTape rec : 126mV/200 Ω (at disc)","S/N / Input conversion noise":"Input Short IFF-A Correction  Input Terminal  Rated Input S/N  Input Conversion Noise EIA S/NDisc(Head amp off)MM:85dB-140dBV82dBDisc(Head amp +26dB):72dB-152dBV76dBDisc(Head amp +32dB):66dB-152dBV76dB Tuner, Line, Tape Play : 110dB-128dBV88dB","Maximum power level\r\n(0.005% distortion rate, 20 Hz to 20 kHz)":"Output(balanced):10.0V\r\nOutput(unbalanced):10.0V\r\nTape Rec : 19.0 V in AD","Disc Maximum Input Voltage\r\n(1 kHz, 0.005% distortion)":"Disc(Head amp off):300mV\r\nDisc(Head amp +26dB):15mV\r\nDisc(Head amp +32dB):7.5mV","Minimum Load Impedance":"Output (unbalanced) : 1k Ω\r\nTape Rec : 10k Ω","Gain":"Tuner, Line, Tape Play → output : 24 db\r\nTuner, Line, Tape Play → Tape rec output : 0 dB\r\nDisc (Head amp off) MM → output : 60 dB\r\nDisc (Head amp off) MM → Tape rec output : 36 dB\r\nHead amp is switchable between + 26 dB and + 32 dB","Loudness Compensator\r\n(volume control -30dB)":"1:+3dB(100Hz)\r\n2 : + 8 dB at 100 Hz, + 6 dB at 20 kHz","Subsonic Filter":"10 Hz, -18dB/oct","Attenuator":"-20dB, -30dB, ∞","Semiconductors used":"Transistors : 225\r\nFET : 16\r\nIC : 33\r\nDiodes : 167","Power Supply":"100 VAC / 117 V / 220 V / 240 V, 50Hz/60Hz","Power Consumption":"75W","External Dimensions":"468 mm wide x 171 mm high x 396 mm deep","Weight":"18.1kg"},"CategoryId":24,"Category":{"$ref":"69"},"CompanyId":2,"Company":{"$ref":"30"}},{"$id":"108","Id":48,"Name":"C-280L","Link":"https://audio-database.com/Accuphase-kensonic/amp/C-280L-e.html","PictureLink":"https://audio-database.com/Accuphase-kensonic/amp/samc-280l.JPG","Description":"The C-280 is a stereo preamplifier with two balanced line amplifiers and ten input terminals.\r\n\r\nIn order to realize balanced transmission with higher quality than conventional transformers, we have installed a balanced transmission line amplifier composed of two amplifiers, one for the hot side and the other for the cold side.\r\nThe same complimentary service differential push-pull amplifier circuit is used for each amplifier.\r\nAlso, the volume is controlled by a precision 4-channel volume (linked to LR channel) which is completely divided into hot and cold.\r\n\r\nIn addition to Class A push-pull in all amplifier stages, the cascode system is further advanced, and an FET is used in the load side of the cascode-connected amplifier, so that there is no need to worry about base current leakage when using a bipolar transistor. Thus, a reproduction sound with less coloring is required.\r\n\r\nDC servo system by IC is adopted for all unit amplifiers, and DC drift is prevented by detecting DC generated at output and returning to input.\r\nWith the DC servo system and precise design, there is almost no DC drift, and all signal systems from MC input to output are directly connected.\r\nThe base plate is firmly fixed with screws, and the output element of class A amplifier and the element of constant voltage power supply are tightly fixed to the housing for heat dissipation, preventing resonance due to induction and vibration.\r\n\r\nThe power supply section has a dedicated power transformer for the left and right channels, making it a completely independent electrical and structural mono-construction.\r\nIn addition, in order to achieve low impedance over a wide range, each unit amplifier is equipped with a dedicated constant voltage power supply, resulting in a total of 6 multiple power supply systems.\r\nThe unit amplifier and the constant-voltage power supply section are housed in a thick aluminum housing and connected at the shortest distance to prevent an increase in the power supply impedance in the high frequency range.\r\n\r\nIn order to construct the shortest and straight signal path, relays are installed in every signal path where a switch is required, and these relays are controlled electronically by logic circuits for switching.\r\nThe relay used is a sealed type with nitrogen gas, which was developed especially for audio and communication equipment. The contact is a crossbar twin system of gold and silver-palladium alloy. It has high quality with low contact resistance and high durability.\r\nIn order to improve reliability, four circuits are used in parallel for the low-level signal path for completeness.\r\n\r\nThe basic circuit of the equalizer amplifier section is almost the same as that of one side of the line amplifier, but a low-noise element is carefully selected especially for the input stage of the differential amplifier.\r\nThe RIAA playback characteristics, which affect sound quality, consist of a network of resistors and capacitors. This section uses a Silbird Mica Capacitor, which has been developed specifically for audio.\r\nThis capacitor has a special processing and structure in which a silver thin film is formed by the screen method on a piece of purified high-purity mica, and a glass pattern (thin glass layer) is printed. This increases the corona discharge starting voltage and allows the signal to pass stably even at high voltage pulses. The lead wire, which affects sound quality, is connected directly to the edge of the silver film so that there is no degradation.\r\n\r\nIn the head amplifier section, a low-noise element is used for the input circuit, and at the same time, resistance noise is reduced by making the impedance of the NFB loop low.\r\nIn addition, in order to avoid the influence of the noise generated by the DC servo, not only the direct feedback method to the negative side of differential amplification but also the feedback to the base of constant current source is used. By this method, the influence of the noise of the servo system is almost eliminated, and SN close to the theoretical limit value is realized.\r\n\r\nThe MC input impedance can be switched between 3 levels of 10 Ω, 30 Ω, and 100 Ω in order to be able to handle various MC cartridges and control sound quality finely.\r\nIn addition to the normal head amplifier gain of 26 dB, a gain selector switch is provided to obtain a gain of 32 dB for the low-power MC cartridge.\r\n\r\nEach input jack is specially made and used with a high-grade rhodium plated jack to prevent deterioration over a long period of time.

When balanced, the + - and + - inputs of amp1 are amplified and input to amp2/amp3, respectively. These two amplifiers feed back their outputs to the other side, so that a + - symmetric signal is sent out with low impedance.\r\nThe advantage of this circuit is that even if one side of the output is grounded, both amplifiers can operate and double the output. Therefore, when an unbalanced connection is made by a normal phono jack, both input and output can operate normally by simply connecting one of them to the ground line.\r\nThis configuration ensures that the amplifier configuration remains the same regardless of whether it is balanced or unbalanced.\r\n\r\nEach unit amplifier of the line amplifier is composed of AccuPhase original symmetrical push-pull circuit.\r\nThe input circuit uses a cascode source follower to achieve stable operation up to very high frequencies, and the output stage uses a complimentary service Darlington push-pull to achieve low output impedance and excellent linearity.\r\nAll of these unit amplifiers are directly connected. In order to suppress shock noise caused by the DC component generated in the output, DC drift is prevented by a DC servo circuit.\r\n\r\nThe power supply section uses a four transformer completely independent power supply with separate left and right equalizer, so that the total capacity of the filter condenser reaches 120,000 μ F.\r\nIn addition, all unit amplifiers are equipped with a wide-band constant voltage power supply to completely prevent mutual interference between amplifiers.\r\n\r\nThe volume adjuster uses a specially developed adjuster for the C-280V.\r\nThe CP (conductive plastic) element used in the studio is used for the resistor. The CP resistor realizes low contact resistance and low distortion factor by shaping the surface to mirror surface by high temperature pressure after printing the resistor element.\r\nThe brush that contacts the resistor is a gold-plated multi-contact type. It is integrated with the external terminal to eliminate the metal joint surface, reducing the strain of different metals. In addition, the rotation method is not a method in which the brush rotates, but a structure in which it is fixed and the resistor rotates. This greatly reduces the internal contact surface and eliminates the contact grease, improving durability.\r\nIn addition, an 8 mm diameter brass shaft is supported by an aluminum cutting bearing, and four elements are each housed in a high-precision aluminum cutting case for complete shielding to improve sound quality.\r\nThe variable method is a continuously variable type, and the tracking error is within 0.5 dB measured at a position of -60dB.\r\n\r\nA logic relay control circuit is used for signal switching.

Balanced transmission is a method of simultaneously transmitting positive and negative symmetrical signals whose phases are inverted with each other. It has an excellent ability to remove common mode noise components.\r\nThe C-290 consists of three differential amplifiers. When balanced, the + - input of amp1 is amplified and fed to amp2 and amp3. These two amplifiers feed back their outputs to the other side, providing a symmetrical + - signal with low impedance.\r\nThe feature of this circuit is that the + - symmetric signal is floating from the ground. Even if one side of the output is grounded, both amplifiers operate and the output voltage does not change. Therefore, in a normal unbalanced connection, either input or output is simply connected to the ground line.\r\n\r\nAll unit amplifiers are composed of Acuphase original symmetric push-pull circuits, and the input circuit is cascode source follower, which realizes stable operation up to ultra-high frequencies.\r\nIn addition, the next-stage differential complimentary service push-pull circuit is made into a module. The module is made of a alumina ceramics substrate with good heat conduction and high-frequency characteristics. As a result, low noise, high thermal and electrical stability and reliability are improved.\r\nThe complimentary service Darlington push-pull stage maintains low output impedance and excellent linearity up to large amplitude.\r\n\r\nThe printed circuit board is made of PRO (Polyphenylene Oxide) resin, a glass cloth substrate.\r\nThis material has almost the same level of electrical properties as the polytetrafluoroethylene (fluorine) resin base material. It has a low dielectric constant, excellent high-frequency characteristics, and performance is compensated up to 12 GHz.\r\nIn addition, a gold plate is applied to the copper foil surface to further improve sound quality.\r\n\r\nThe power transformer and filter condenser are independent on the left and right and are completely monophonic. In addition, all unit amplifiers are equipped with wide-band constant voltage power supply to prevent mutual interference between amplifiers.\r\nThe power transformer uses an amorphous core with excellent frequency characteristics. Amorphous alloy ribbons are obtained by ultra-quenching molten metal. Amorphous alloys are amorphous metals with no crystal structure. Therefore, they have superior magnetic and mechanical properties compared to metals with crystal structure. The main feature of amorphous alloy ribbons is that they have superior overcurrent characteristics because they have a high maximum magnetic flux density. Temperature changes have little influence on the core because they have a high Curie point (temperature at which magnetic characteristics change abruptly) unique to magnetic circuits. Heat generation is small because iron losses such as hysteresis loss and overcurrent loss are small.\r\nThe amorphous material used for C-290 is an Fe-based core with a thickness of 25 μ m.\r\n\r\nThe volume uses a four link volume controller that uses a CP (conductive plastic) element as a resistor, which is also used for the C-280V.\r\nAfter the resistance element is printed, the surface of the CP resistor is finished into a mirror surface by high temperature pressure shaping to realize low contact resistance and low distortion factor. Also, the brush that contacts the resistor is a gold-plated multi-contact type, and it is integrated with the external terminal to eliminate the metal joint surface, reducing distortion caused by contact between different metals.\r\nThe rotation method is not a general method in which a brush rotates, but adopts a structure in which a resistor rotates. This greatly reduces the internal contact points and eliminates the need for contact grease, improving durability.\r\nAn 8 mm diameter extra-thick brass shaft is supported by an aluminum cutting bearing, and four elements are each housed in a high-precision aluminum cutting case for complete shielding to improve sound quality.\r\nThe tracking error is less than 0.5 dB measured at -60dB.\r\n\r\nA logic relay control circuit is used to switch the input signal.\r\nRelays are installed where switching is necessary and electronically controlling them with a logic circuit, we prevent the deterioration of sound quality caused by the routing of signal paths and the deterioration of contact points caused by direct switching with a selector.\r\nThe relay used in this circuit has a completely sealed structure filled with nitrogen gas, which has been developed especially for audio and communication equipment. Gold and silver-palladium alloy cross-bar twin type contact points affect sound quality, providing low contact resistance and high durability.\r\n\r\nEach of the 4-unit left and right amplifiers, such as line and balance amplifier circuits, is equipped with a dedicated constant-voltage power supply unit. To prevent these unit amplifiers from interfering with each other, they are housed in a thick aluminum housing. The output and constant-voltage power supply elements are firmly fixed to the housing for heat dissipation, and resonance due to vibration is also prevented.\r\nThe overall structure consists of an 8 mm thick rigid aluminum framework to which a thick glass-epoxy motherboard is firmly secured and on which an aluminum housing is screwed.\r\n\r\nIt is equipped with a 1-dB-step attenuator that can control the orientation in any listening position with perfect channel balance.\r\nThe operation can be changed from 0 to -6dB and - ∞ with the left and right push buttons respectively, and it is displayed on the text display on the panel.\r\n\r\nIt has a phase switch which inverts the phase of the whole device.\r\nThe switching method is simply to replace the + - of the balance amplifier input, so there is no additional circuit like a phase inverter, so there is no sound quality degradation.\r\n\r\nIt is equipped with a compensator switch to improve the sense of volume when the volume is low.\r\nIt automatically adjusts the response according to the position of the volume control to maintain a natural balance.\r\n\r\nEquipped with a subsonic filter to cut ultra-low frequency noise.\r\n\r\n6N high-purity copper wire is used for the power cord that makes up the power circuit and has a great effect on sound quality.\r\nThe connector type power supply also supports commercially available power cords.\r\n\r\nThe C-280 is designed exclusively for the CD line, but it can be used for recording with a special phono equalizer unit (sold separately).\r\n\r\nThe line and balance unit amplifier can be mounted on the C-280V.\r\nBy replacing four C-280V line balance amplifier units, you can enjoy the change of sound quality.","Propierties":{"$id":"113","Type":"Stereo Preamplifier","Frequency Response":"balanced input (CD, Line) :  3 Hz to 350 kHz + 0 -3.0 dB\r\n20 Hz ~ 20 kHz + 0 -0.2 dB  CD, Tuner, Line, Tape Play :  3 Hz to 350 kHz + 0 -3.0 dB\r\n20 Hz ~ 20 kHz + 0 -0.2 dB","Total Harmonic Distortion Factor":"0.005% (at all input terminals)","Input sensitivity / impedance  (at rated output / 0.5 V output)":"Balanced : 252mV/63mV/40k Ω (20k Ω / 20k Ω)\r\nUnbalanced : 252mV/63mV/20k Ω","Rated Output / Impedance":"Balanced output : 2.0V/50 ohm\r\nUnbalanced output : 2.0V/50 ohm\r\nTape rec : 252mV/200 Ω","S/N / Input conversion noise":"Input Terminal  Input Short IFF-A Correction  Rated Output S/N  Input Conversion Noise EIA S/NBalanced:111dB-123dBV95dBUnbalanced:111dB-123dBV95dB","Maximum power level\r\n(0.005% distortion rate, 20 Hz to 20 kHz)":"Balanced output:8.0V\r\nUnbalanced output:8.0V\r\nTape rec:9.5V","Minimum Load Impedance":"Balanced output : 600 ohms\r\nUnbalanced output : 600 ohm\r\nTape rec : 10k Ω","Gain":"Balanced input → Balanced output : 18 dB\r\nBalanced input → Unbalanced output : 18 dB\r\nUnbalanced input → Balanced output : 18 dB\r\nUnbalanced input → Unbalanced output : 18 dB\r\nUnbalanced input → rec output : 0 dB","Loudness Compensator\r\n(Volume -30dB)":"1:+3dB(100Hz)\r\n2 : + 8 dB at 100 Hz, + 6 dB at 20 kHz","Subsonic Filter":"10 Hz, -18dB/oct","Attenuator":"-20dB","Power Supply Voltage":"100 VAC / 117 V / 220 V / 240 V, 50Hz/60Hz","Power Consumption":"30W","Maximum External Dimensions":"475 mm wide x 149 mm high x 405 mm deep\r\nWhen adding AD-290 : Depth 414 mm","Weight":"23.8kg\r\nWhen adding AD-290 : 24.8 kg","Sold Separately":"Dedicated Phono Equalizer Unit AD-290 (¥ 200,000)"},"CategoryId":24,"Category":{"$ref":"69"},"CompanyId":2,"Company":{"$ref":"30"}},{"$id":"114","Id":51,"Name":"C-290V","Link":"https://audio-database.com/Accuphase-kensonic/amp/C-290V-e.html","PictureLink":"https://audio-database.com/Accuphase-kensonic/amp/samc-290v.JPG","Description":"Based on the balanced transmission technology established in C-290, a current feedback amplifier circuit is adopted. As a culmination of analog preamp, this control amplifier aims at the highest level by further improving the completeness of all circuits.\r\n\r\nIt uses a current feedback amplifier circuit that feeds back the output signal in the form of a current.\r\nIn this circuit, the impedance of the input terminal on the feedback side is lowered to detect a current, and the current is converted to I-V by a transimpedance amplifier to produce an output signal. Since the impedance of the feedback input part is extremely low, phase rotation hardly occurs, and there is almost no need for phase guarantee. Therefore, various characteristics can be greatly improved with a small amount of NFB, and dynamic characteristics such as rising are excellent, and natural energy response is obtained in terms of sound quality.\r\n\r\nIt is equipped with a bridge feedback type balance output circuit.\r\nBalanced transmission is a method of simultaneously transmitting positive and negative symmetric signals whose phases are inverted with each other. It has an excellent ability to remove common mode noise components.\r\nIn C-290V, the outputs of two pairs of amplifiers are fed back to the other side, and the + - symmetric signal is sent out with low impedance. In this circuit, since the + - symmetric signal is floating from ground, even if one side of the output is grounded, both amplifiers operate and the output voltage does not change.\r\n\r\nThe line amplifier is a pure complimentary service push-pull circuit and consists of discrete parts using a current feedback amplifier circuit. This reduces phase compensation at each stage.\r\n<br>\r\nThe signal transmission circuit uses a printed circuit board made of Teflon (glass cloth fluorine resin).\r\nThis material has the lowest relative dielectric constant and dissipation factor, excellent heat resistance and high frequency characteristics, and is used mainly for satellite broadcasting and high-precision measuring instruments using the SHF band.\r\nIn printed circuit boards, the lower the dielectric constant, the faster the signal propagation speed, and the smaller the dielectric dissipation factor, the smaller the transmission loss. The C-290V has a gold plate on the copper foil to further improve the sound quality.\r\n\r\nThe power transformer and filter capacitor are independent on the left and right, and are completely monaural. In addition, all unit amplifiers are equipped with a wide-band low-impedance power supply to prevent interference between amplifiers.\r\nThe power transformer uses an amorphous core with excellent frequency characteristics. Amorphous is a composite thin band obtained by ultra-rapid cooling of molten metal. It is an amorphous metal with no crystal structure. As a result, it has superior magnetic and mechanical properties compared with crystal structure metals, and has excellent characteristics and features for audio applications.\r\n\r\nThe volume is a 4-strand volume that uses a conductive plastic (CP) element as a resistor.\r\nThe CP resistor is an element with low contact resistance and low distortion factor whose surface is finished to mirror surface by high temperature pressure molding after the resistance element is printed.\r\nAn 8 mm diameter extra-thick brass shaft is supported by an aluminum cutting bearing, and each of the four elements is housed in a high-precision aluminum cutting case for complete shielding to improve sound quality.\r\nThe variable method is a continuously variable type, and the tracking error is within 0.5 dB measured at the position of -60dB.\r\n\r\nThe logic relay control method is used to configure the shortest and straight signal transmission.\r\nThe relay used for this is a closed type relay for the communication industry. The contact is gold-plated and crossbar twin system, and low contact resistance and high durability are obtained.\r\n\r\nThe amplifier circuit consists of a total of four unit amplifiers on the left and right, such as a line input and a balance output, each with its own power supply.\r\nThese unit amplifiers are housed in a thick aluminum housing to prevent interference.\r\n\r\nNine NINE RCA-phono jacks for input, a balanced input in the Route 3, and a Route 6 for output.\r\n\r\nThe left and right balance controls use a 1-dB-step attenuator that can be adjusted from 0 to -6dB and - ∞ with the left and right push buttons, respectively.

It is equipped with a dedicated input circuit that matches each cartridge of MM/MC. At MM input, it is composed of FET elements with high S/N. Since MC receives minute signals with low impedance, it is composed of a differential input circuit with low-noise elements, enabling low-noise reproduction.\r\nThree types of MC input impedance can be selected, and two types of MC/MM gain can be selected according to the output of the cartridge. These can be switched on the C-290V panel.\r\n\r\nIt is also compatible with the phono equalizer unit AD-290 used for the C-290 and can be used for the C-290V.","Propierties":{"$id":"115","Type":"Stereo Control Amp","Frequency Response":"Balanced, Unbalanced :  3 Hz to 300 kHz + 0 -3.0 dB\r\n20 Hz ~ 20 kHz + 0 -0.2 dB\r\nAD MM/36dB, MC input : 20 Hz ~ 20 kHz ± 0.2 dB\r\nAD MM/30dB input : 20 Hz ~ 20 kHz ± 0.3 dB","Total Harmonic Distortion Factor":"0.005%","Input Sensitivity / Impedance  (Rated Output / 0.5 v Output)":"AD MM/30dB : 8.0mV/2.0mV/47k Ω\r\nAD MM/36dB : 4.0mV/1.0mV/47k Ω\r\nAD MC/62dB : 0.2mV/0.05mV/10 Ω, 30 Ω, 100 Ω switching\r\nAD MC/68dB : 0.1mV/0.025mV/10 Ω, 30 Ω, 100 Ω switching\r\nBalanced : 252mV/63mV/40k Ω\r\nUnbalanced : 252mV/63mV/20k Ω","Rated Output / Impedance":"Balanced, Unbalanced output : 2V/50 Ω\r\nTape rec (at AD input) : 252mV/200 Ω","S/N, input conversion noise":"Input Short A - Correction EIA S/N S/N at rated output  Input Conversion Noise AD MM/30dB:94dB-136dBV86dBAD MM/36dB:90dB-138dBV86dBAD MC/62dB:80dB-154dBV85dBAD MC/68dB:75dB-155dBV85dBBalanced:111dB-123dBV95dBUnbalanced111dB-123dBV95dB","Maximum power level\r\n(0.005% distortion rate, 20 Hz to 20 kHz)":"Balanced, Unbalanced output : 8.0 v\r\nTape rec:9.5V","AD Maximum Input Voltage\r\n(1 kHz, 0.005% distortion)":"MM(30dB/36dB) input:300mV/150mV\r\nMC(62dB/68dB) input:7.5mV/3.75mV","Minimum Load Impedance":"Balanced, Unbalanced output : 600 ohms\r\nTape rec : 10k Ω","Gain":"Balanced, Unbalanced input → Balanced, Unbalanced output : 18 dB\r\nUnbalanced input → Rec output : 0 dB\r\nAD MM (30/36dB) input → Balanced, Unbalanced output : 48/54dB\r\nAD MM (30/36dB) input → Rec output : 30/36dB\r\nAD MC (62/68dB) input → Balanced, Unbalanced output : 80/86dB\r\nAD MC (62/68dB) input → Rec output : 62/68dB","Compensator\r\n(Volume -30dB)":"1:+3dB(100Hz)\r\n2 : + 8 dB at 100 Hz, + 6 dB at 20 kHz","Subsonic Filter":"10 Hz, -18dB/oct","Attenuator":"-20dB","Power Supply":"100 VAC, 50Hz/60Hz","Power Consumption":"24W","Maximum External Dimensions":"469 mm wide x 160 mm high x 405 mm deep\r\nWhen adding AD-290V : Depth 414 mm","Weight":"23.8kg\r\nWhen AD-290V is added : 24.8 kg","Sold Separately":"Phono equalizer unit AD-290V (¥ 200,000)"},"CategoryId":24,"Category":{"$ref":"69"},"CompanyId":2,"Company":{"$ref":"30"}},{"$id":"116","Id":52,"Name":"C-2000","Link":"https://audio-database.com/Accuphase-kensonic/amp/c-2000.html","PictureLink":"https://audio-database.com/Accuphase-kensonic/amp/samc-2000.jpg","Description":"A stereo control amplifier with AAVA volume control, inheriting the design technology of C-2800 and C-2400.\r\n\r\nThe volume control uses the Accuphase Analog Vari-gain Amplifier (AAVA) method.\r\nAAVA is a pure analog volume control system that combines an amplifier and volume control to provide many performance advantages because the music signal does not pass through a variable resistor. AAVA is composed of highly reliable semiconductor components that enable long-term performance and sound quality.\r\nThe AAVA uses 16 weighted V-I conversion amplifiers to convert music signals into current. Each amplifier is turned ON/OFF by 16 power switches. The volume is determined by the combination of these switches. The CPU (microcomputer) controls the knob position and volume to be the same. The combination of these currents is a Variable Gain Circuit that changes the magnitude of the music signal. Each current is combined by an I-V converter to return the voltage.\r\nFor volume adjustment with a general variable resistor, impedance increases at the volume position normally used and noise increases. However, AAVA is not affected by impedance changes, so S/N does not deteriorate and frequency characteristics do not change. Therefore, noise does not increase at a practical volume level, so high S/N ratio can be maintained and sound quality does not change. In addition, since a fixed resistor is used, there is almost no difference in volume between left and right even at a minute level. Also, crosstalk between channels can be eliminated because each channel can be made independent.\r\nThe volume control detects the volume position by turning position by turning the knob on the panel so that it can be operated with the same feeling as a conventional amplifier. The volume balance between left and right and the attenuator is also controlled by the AAVA so that extra circuits can be eliminated and the configuration is simple.\r\n\r\nThe C-2000 amplifier circuit consists of a total of five unit amplifiers including an input buffer, an AAVA, and a balanced output.

N-channel power MOS\r\nPush-pull configuration in which FET and P-channel power MOS FETs are each connected in 10-parallel.\r\nThe allowable loss power of one MOS FET is 120W, and the power load per pair is 5W due to the 10-parallel connection.\r\nIt is easy to use the low power region with excellent linearity of FET, and the high current by pure class A operation is reduced to 1/10, improving the stability of the whole circuit.\r\nA large heat sink made of aluminum die-cast is used for heat treatment in class A operation to improve stability.\r\nFurthermore, by using a power MOS FET in the drive stage, the switching speed is increased, and at the same time, the negative feedback system is lighter and the sound quality is improved.\r\nThe maximum clipping level is set to 100W (8 Ω) to save the momentary pulses that sometimes appear in the music signal from clipping.\r\n\r\nThe input stage has a balanced differential pure complimentary service push-pull configuration, and FET buffers with high input impedance and low output impedance are used for the + (non-inverted) and - (inverted) input circuits, respectively.\r\nAn important part of this input circuit is modularized by large 60mmx35mm hybrid ICs. A symmetric circuit is placed on the base of the alumina ceramics to improve the temperature and noise characteristics.\r\nIn addition, the IC is covered with thick aluminum to protect it from external influences.\r\n\r\nIt can be used as a monaural power amplifier with bridge connection.\r\nBridge connection is a method in which two amplifiers are supplied with signals of the same voltage and opposite phases and a speaker is connected to the output terminals of both amplifiers. When an 8 Ω load is connected, it is possible to obtain twice the output of 4 Ω stereo drive.\r\nThe bridge connection of A-50 utilizes the polarity of the differential inputs of two amplifiers. By changing the connection so that the opposite phase signals are input to each other, a pure switching circuit without inserting a phase inversion circuit is constructed.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the normal RCA pin jack input, there is a full-scale balanced input. The XLR-type connector allows connection to devices with balanced outputs.\r\nFor the balance input of A-50, the signal is directly injected into the non-inverting (+) and inverting (-) inputs of the differential input circuit. For this reason, a 2-channel attenuator with 1-dB steps is used as the attenuator.\r\nThis attenuator is a high-quality type with a mirror finished resistor that has a particularly low distortion factor and excellent wear resistance.\r\n\r\nHigh-purity copper is used for the part where the signal passes. The metal plate is made of gold to reduce the skin resistance and smooth the current flow.\r\nIn addition, gold plates are applied to the oxygen-free copper plates used for the parts that handle large currents, and high-purity wire materials are used for the shield coat around the attenuator to improve sound quality.\r\n\r\nThe power supply section uses a high-efficiency toroidal transformer with a high power capacity of 1000 VA. The transformer is enclosed in an aluminum die-cast case and fixed inside with a resin with an elastic coefficient that suppresses vibration, thereby preventing external effects.\r\nThe smoothing capacitor is a large capacitor of 56,000 μ Fx2 (charge capacity 3.5 clone x2). Ordinary capacitors are insulated with a vinyl sleeve, but the A-50 is made with a flexible soft coating called urethane coating (Fantas-Coat) to resist vibration.\r\n\r\nEquipped with power meter with digital display.\r\nThe meter circuit displays a power value based on the mounted impedance of the speaker, detects current and voltage, uses an analog multiplier to calculate the power, and sends this value from the A/D converter to the microcomputer for digital display.\r\nThe display stationary time (hold time) can be switched between 1 second and infinite (∞) time.
