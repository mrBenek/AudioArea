				<p class="detail">A control amplifier with module amplifier structure.<br><br>Equipped with a transformer for MC cartridges to support MC cartridges.<br>In the Exclude C5, spiral ribbon Sendust is used for the core material of the transformer. This material exhibits flat magnetic properties over a wide band and is resistant to mechanical stress. It is used as a large core material to increase the regenerative capacity.<br>In addition, two oxygen-free copper wires with diameters of 0.25 mm are used in parallel for winding to reduce DCR (direct current resistance). In addition, transmission characteristics are greatly improved by tightly winding the wire around the core without using protective insulation such as resin.<br><br>A monoconstruction structure is adopted in which all the input / output section, amplifier section and power supply section are divided into left and right channels.<br>In particular, the power supply section is equipped with four power transformers, two for the left and right channels, and two for the right and left channels. These transformers are divided into two for the equalizer amplifier and for the flat / buffer amplifier, and the rectifier circuit is also independent of each other. This multi-power supply system eliminates mutual interference. We are also equipped with a dedicated power transformer for relay control. We are pursuing the concept of one stage, one circuit and one power supply.<br>In addition, a 6-core power cord is used to completely separate the L/R, relay control and AC outlet.<br><br>All amplifiers of three blocks of one channel are modularized.<br>Each circuit is based on a 280 μ m thick oxygen-free copper foil glass-epoxy board and composed of high-quality discrete component. These are hardened with high-density epoxy and stored in a carbon-filled conductive plastic case. The equalizer is also a module with the same structure.<br>These measures prevent vibration from the outside and parts themselves, suppress distortion, prevent sound quality degradation due to electromagnetic waves, and improve the durability and thermal stability of parts.<br><br>The main volume uses a unique 40-point attenuator that has been further improved based on BTS&#39; strict specifications.<br>The control elements are made of carefully selected carbon resistors, all of which are contained in a brass case. In addition, copper-containing solder is used for the junction, silver alloy is used for the contact material, and brass is used for the L/R separator.<br>The control range is 0 to -90dB and - ∞.<br><br>The power cord uses a high-quality thick power cord.<br>This cord uses high-conductivity oxygen-free copper for conductors, and is insulated with polyethylene for double insulation structure to eliminate conductor squeal. Carbon is also used for coloring pigments for insulation materials to minimize degradation of sound quality caused by pigments.<br>Furthermore, the 6-core structure reduces mutual interference by independently separating the left and right channels and relay control. Polarity control is also achieved by displaying polarity on the plug.<br><br>99.99% pure twisted oxygen-free copper wire is used for the signal path wiring material.<br>This material contains only 3 ppm of oxygen, which is an element of copper zincification, an impurity semiconductor, and is reduced to 1/100 compared with general electrolytic copper with purity of 99.95%.<br><br>In the Exclusive C5, the tone function is released by setting the control knob of each bus / treble to the center position. When the tone control release switch is installed, the tone quality degradation caused by signal line routing is prevented.<br><br>The rear panel input terminals are arranged symmetrically to prevent interference between the left and right channels.<br><br>The cabinet is made of natural wood from Brazilian Rosewood.<br>The front panel is hand-made and the control knob is made of solid material, giving it a high interior quality.</p>
