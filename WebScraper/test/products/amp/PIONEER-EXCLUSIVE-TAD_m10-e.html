				<p class="detail">This is a stereo power amplifier designed with low distortion, low noise and ultra-wide bandwidth by completely eliminating magnetic materials that distort sound.<br><br>The M10 uses an aluminum chassis and bonnet to eliminate the effect of magnetic magnetostriction.<br><br>A newly developed FET complimentary service double-differential amplifier circuit is used for the circuit structure. All stages of the power amplifier are configured in the complimentary service push-pull configuration so that the rise and fall of the signal are under the same conditions.<br><br>It employs a non-switching servo module that eliminates switching distortion and combines class A operating wave performance with class B high efficiency.<br><br>The M10 uses an integrated condenser with four built-in electrolytic capacitors and a resin case.<br>In this method, the inductance component can be reduced by separating the normal two lines (one for positive and one for negative) into four lines. The wiring can be made into a pseudo four terminal type and can be divided into charging side and discharging side. In addition, the electrolytic solution, aluminum foil, element structure, terminal lead-out structure, etc. are examined from the electrical and sound quality aspects, and the impedance at 10 kHz is reduced to less than half that of conventional electrolytic capacitors.<br>In addition, the use of a resin case prevents distortion due to eddy impedance characteristics and reduces distortion.<br><br>The pin jack is gold-plated.<br>In general gold plating, nickel plating is applied to the base in order to stabilize the plating. Therefore, due to the influence of the ferromagnetic material nickel, the strain caused by hysteresis is generated. The newly developed pin jack used in the C-10 is coated with a non-magnetic base plating that shows stability equal to or higher than that of nickel to prevent the generation of strain.<br><br>Oxygen-free copper wire is used for wiring inside the amplifier.<br><br>The power cord uses a highly reliable 15A large-capacity power cord with double insulation.<br>In addition, the core wire of this power cord is color-coded in black and white, and the connection with the AC plug is managed to unify the polarity.<br><br>A 140 μ m thick copper foil glass epoxy board is used for the substrate.<br>Conventional glass epoxy boards used 35 μ m copper foil attached to them. However, in order to reduce DCR (direct current resistance) and inductance in the board, we use 140 μ m copper foil, which is four times larger than conventional ones.<br><br>The wooden case uses an oil finish of Andes Rose natural wood.<br><br>Pin cord for connection is included.<br>This connection code uses a oxygen-free copper wire as the material and a gold-plated plug made of a non-magnetic material as the pin plug to minimize the occurrence of strain in the connection code. In addition, unlike the conventional coaxial structure, the structure of the connection code is a star quad system in which the core wires of the signal wires facing each other are twisted together to reduce the inductance. In addition, the signal wires are made of conductive polymer material and completely shielded by polarization.</p>
