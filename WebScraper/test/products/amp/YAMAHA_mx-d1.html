				<p class="detail">This is a digital power amplifier that combines high sound quality and power superior to those of super-class analog power amplifiers into a thin and lightweight body.<br><br>It is a class D amplifier which adopts PWM method for the amplifier circuit.<br><br>Conventional digital amplifiers have had performance problems that must be solved for high-end audio applications, such as power supply voltage dependence, dynamic range, and distortion factor.<br>To overcome these technical limitations, the MX-D1 uses newly developed Yamaha original digital amplifier devices, YDA133 (Modulator LSI) and YDA134 (Power MOS-FET Drive LSI). These devices combine excellent speaker drive power with low power consumption and compactness that cannot be achieved with a same class analog power amplifier.<br><br>The MX-D1 is equipped with a newly installed constant gain PLL modulator circuit.<br>In conventional digital amplifiers, the power supply voltage variation is directly reflected in the amplifier gain variation, which is a problem in improving the performance.<br>The constant gain PLL modulator circuit used in the MX-D1 operates in synchronization with the built-in reference clock and generates a PWM output waveform with a fixed frequency of &quot;modulation factor x power supply voltage = constant&quot; from two systems of information of the input signal and the output stage power supply voltage. Canceling the power supply dependency of the output signal enhances the bare characteristics of the whole amplifier and realizes stable amplification without relying on excessive feedback.<br><br>A digital cross-feedback loop that improves the linearity of both the constant gain PLL modulator circuit and the output buffer stage realizes a high dynamic range of 120 dB and a low distortion rate of 0.002%, which are superior to conventional digital power amplifiers.<br>In addition, the advanced analog feedback with overall feedback including the LC filter of the analog output section achieves broadband characteristics up to 100 khz and an excellent damping factor.<br><br>Equipped with an active power control system.<br>In this circuit, the voltage limiter value is controlled in real time by detecting the output current of the power amplifier, and continuous maximum output and dynamic power are independently controlled to arbitrary values. Combined with the power MOS-FET output stage, high power is guaranteed over a wide load impedance range.<br><br>The power supply section uses the latest version of voltage and current resonance switching power supply based on Yamaha&#39;s patented technology to realize high efficiency and low noise characteristics.<br>The magnetic coupling and complimentary service rectifying circuit adopted in the secondary rectifying circuit keeps the power supply voltage from the positive side to the negative side stable and symmetrical at all times, and supports power and high sound quality up to the total rating of 1 kw.<br><br>An ultra-high speed protection circuit is mounted as a protection circuit.<br>The MX-D1 realizes ultra-high precision and ultra-high speed protection operation by integrating an ultra-high speed current detection circuit that responds to the instantaneous pulse current of one digital pulse wave and safety operation sequence logic that monitors the operation of the whole amplifier into the YDA133/YDA134 power engine.<br><br>The internal construction uses twin monaural construction. The main circuit board has independent left and right channels, and each channel is housed in a separate room. This achieves channel separation of over 100 dB.<br>In addition, the boards of the input amplifier, output terminal, and power line filter are provided with a private room separate from the main board to eliminate internal electrical interference and radiation and improve sound quality.<br><br>Non-resonance shape high sound quality legs made of brass machined are used for the legs.<br>By using copper-plated steel for the inner chassis and aluminum for the rear panel and top cover, rear panel and top cover to ensure sufficient strength while reducing the effects of unwanted resonance and magnetic distortion.<br>The front and side panels are made of extruded aluminum up to 12 mm thick with piano black paint.<br><br>The output filter uses a specially designed double-core low-impedance toroidal coil and a high-current special capacitor.<br>The circuit impedance is reduced by using a 4-layer epoxy board with 70 μ m foil thickness, and a custom-designed electrolytic capacitor for high-sound power supply is used for power supply.<br><br>WBT&#39;s RCA input terminal and speaker output terminal are used for the terminals.</p>
