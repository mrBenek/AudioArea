				<p class="detail">Monaural power amplifier refined from B-10.<br><br>In the final stage of the power amplifier, eight Pc200W class multi-emitter transistors are used for the plus signal and the minus signal respectively, for a total of 16 transistors.<br>As a result, a huge output of 500W at 8 Ω load and 1000W at 4 Ω load is achieved.<br><br>The CSSC uses a single-stagger circuit with an additional complimentary service configuration to minimize control and avoid excessive control and adverse effects on sound quality.<br>The first stage is a complimentary service circuit of a dual FET with a high input impedance and a cascode-connected transistor, and the second stage is a rectifying transmission stage with a grounded base. By increasing the cut-off frequency, natural signal amplification is achieved without the need for extra phase correction.<br>In addition, it uses a fully balanced CSSC configuration that combines two CSSC circuits to cancel out noise mixed into the signal at the time of output, making it resistant to external influences and improving S/N ratio.<br><br>The NFB correction, which is used to unify the mid-high and low-frequency tones of the amplifier, employs an OD Beta circuit that eliminates the DC servo amplifier by refining the naked characteristics of the circuit and makes it possible to unify the tone over the entire band.<br><br>The power supply section uses a large 800 VA EI transformer and a 22000 μ F custom-made capacitor with excellent charge-discharge characteristics to enhance regulation due to the bare nature of the power supply section, and a high-inertia power supply that can cope with voltage fluctuations with a margin.<br>This makes it possible to provide a natural power supply with little fluctuation when observed on a micro-scale by changing unnatural voltage fluctuations into slow fluctuations.<br><br>A 6-contact independent fixed resistance switching attenuator is used for the input section.<br>The military-standard, high-precision, large carbon film resistor (1W type) allows for optimal settings without loss of sound quality.<br>In addition, in consideration of connection with various devices, a new reference position has been set so that an output of 100W can be obtained at 1 V input.<br><br>Equipped with an easy-to-use logarithmic compression type 120x100mm large power meter.<br><br>As a countermeasure against external noise and interference noise as well as thorough elimination of unnecessary vibration which adversely affects sound quality, it is based on 5-point grounding type FRP chassis base which is excellent in vibration absorption mode and protects stable operation. The casing has a high rigidity box isolation structure which eliminates mutual interference between each circuit.<br>In addition, internal filters have been strengthened to prevent high-frequency noise generated by PCs and microcomputer equipment.<br><br>In order to provide a cleaner and more stable power supply, we have implemented various measures against interference noise and unnecessary vibration in the power supply.<br>An independent power supply room system is adopted in which power supplies such as transformers, rectifier diodes, and block capacitors are completely separated from the signal path and housed in a separate chassis.<br><br>The input section is equipped with two types of terminals, a balance terminal and an RCA terminal. The speaker terminal is equipped with an originally developed large speaker terminal compatible with a banana terminal.<br>It is also compatible with the Speakon terminal used in professional sound field.<br><br>In addition to the newly developed ultra low-noise custom-made resistor, custom parts such as large power transformer, large-capacity block capacitor, electrolytic capacitor, copper Styrofoam capacitor, copper bus bar and 6N cable are adopted.<br>In addition, in order to minimize impedance fluctuation, a copper foil pattern with a thickness of 70 μ m and a glass epoxy board with excellent insulation properties are adopted.<br><br>The front is carved out of pure aluminum panel, and the unique taste is added by special satin finish.<br>Wooden cabinet is used.<br><br>Equipped with a line phase sensor that senses the polarity of the AC power supply, setting can always be done with correct polarity.</p>
