				<p class="detail">A stereo power amplifier, an improved version of the M-10.<br><br>The last stage of the power amplifier has a complimentary service 4 parallel configuration using 8 multi-emitter structure large bipolar transistors (Pc200W class) per channel. It has an excellent ability to respond to changes in speaker impedance due to music signals.<br><br>It can be used not only as a normal stereo power amplifier but also as a monaural high power amplifier using a BTL.<br><br>It adopts CSSC (Complementary Single Stagger Circuit) applying advanced high frequency circuit technology, and realizes high slew rate characteristics and wide bandwidth expression.<br>The first stage is the complimentary service circuit of the dual-FET differential and the cascode-connected transistor. The second stage is the common-base type current transmission stage, which has a sufficiently high cut-off frequency. The bandwidth of the entire amplifier can be secured only by the phase rotation of the first stage. Therefore, the initial slew rate can be kept extremely high and natural music playback is achieved without the need for extra correction. The drive circuit and the final stage are composed of a 3-stage Darlington complimentary service circuit with high amplification factor.<br><br>It adopts OD β circuit which is original NFB technology.<br>NFB circuits are used to improve characteristics and ensure circuit stability. However, in general DC and AC separate feedback systems, a servo amplifier is added to provide a large amount of NFB in order to control DC feedback, which has a large effect on the low-frequency range. This creates a sense of inconsistency in tone color due to the difference between the mid-range and low-frequency ranges.<br>The OD β circuit adopted in the M-10II is a thorough approach to the optimum NFB from the viewpoint of sound quality. By refining the bare characteristics of the circuit to a high degree and ensuring sufficient DC stability, the DC servo amplifier is eliminated and the sound quality over all bands is unified.<br><br>High-inertia power supply is used for the power supply section.<br>In the conventional method, the power supply follows the music signal, so the delay control is always applied to the music signal. In order to solve this problem, the high-inertia power supply is equipped with a large-capacity power transformer to sufficiently increase the regulation at the AC level. In addition, we have newly developed a large-capacity special electrolytic capacitor with extremely excellent instantaneous discharge characteristics at the output side of the regulator circuit. This structure always pools a loose power supply inside the amplifier and minimizes delay control.<br>In addition, the power transformer is equipped with a large 800 VA power transformer with three independent windings and a high-capacity 22,000 μ F electrolytic capacitor. Control and eliminating small voltage fluctuations by achieving high regulation with low impedance.<br><br>LAX&#39;s unique STAR circuit pattern technology has been introduced.<br>In general amplifier circuits, the supply route from the power supply to each circuit is shared, but in the STAR circuit, power is supplied to each amplifier stage through a separate route, which clarifies the reference point for amplification and eliminates interference noise through the ground line.<br><br>The internal construction is based on a high-quality 5-point grounded FRP chassis with excellent vibration absorption mode. It has a high-rigidity box isolation structure with each circuit partitioned by shielding plates. This increases the strength of the chassis as a whole and eliminates electrical and mechanical interference between circuits.<br>In addition, the internal high-frequency filter is reinforced as part of various noise countermeasures to protect the purity of the music signal at the minute signal level.<br><br>In addition to the newly developed ultra-low-noise low-distortion resistor exclusively for LUX, high-quality custom parts such as large power transformer, large-capacity block capacitor, electrolytic capacitor, copper-styrene capacitor, copper bus bar and high-purity 6N cable are adopted.<br>In order to minimize impedance fluctuations, a glass epoxy board with a 70 μ m thick copper foil pattern is used.<br><br>The input section uses an independent 6-contact fixed resistance switching attenuator on the right and left sides, enabling input level setting without loss of sound quality.<br>Also, in consideration of how to use a multi-channel amplifier, etc., a reference position is set so that an output of 100W can be obtained at 1 V input.<br><br>The input terminal is equipped with two systems, XLR and RCA.<br>In addition, the speaker terminal banana plug is equipped with a large 3-way speaker terminal that looks like a sea bream and a professional audio standard Spicon terminal.<br><br>Equipped with a 120x100mm logarithmic compression display type large meter.<br>The light of this meter can be turned on / off.<br><br>Glossy wooden box is used for the cabinet.<br>In addition, solid aluminum is used for the front panel, and a satin finish is applied to the surface.<br><br>Equipped with a run-phase sensor that senses the polarity of the AC power supply.</p>
