					Integrated amplifier which supplied the development technology of separate amplifier, renewed the image of the conventional Integrated Amplifier, and investigated cost performance to the limit. <br>
					There were two kinds of E-210A which built in E-210 and the equalizer amplifier for analog discs of line amplifier composition. <br>
					
                        <br>
					The power transistor for audios of Oide power 
multi-emitter structure excellent in many characteristics, such as a frequency 
response, an electric power amplification factor linearity, and switching, is 
adopted as the output stage of a power amplifier part. It has structure which 
carried out parallel connection of this and was attached to the large-sized heat 
sink. <br>
					Operation to heat adopted the power MOS FET of the negative 
characteristic as the drive stage, the power transistor and heat inclination of 
the right characteristic were offset, and stable operation is realized in it. 
<br>
					
                        <br>
					Although many voltage return types which return a part of Output voltage 
to an input are used in the general magnification circuit, in E-210, the current 
feedback type magnification circuit which returns an output signal in the form 
of current is adopted. <br>
					This circuit lowers the impedance of the input 
terminal by the side of a return, detects current, carries out I-V 
(current-voltage) conversion of that current with a transformer impedance amplifier, and makes an output signal. Since the impedance of a return input 
portion is very low, it is hard to generate phase rotation and, as a result, 
there is almost no necessity for a phase guarantee. <br>
					For this reason, it 
excelled in dynamic characteristics, such as a standup, and sound quality is 
sharply improved by natural energy response. <br>
					
                        <br>
					The system which inputs 
line-in signals, such as CD and a tuner, into direct high gain power amplifier 
is adopted. <br>
					
                        Even if this system enlarges a gain, by the current feedback magnification
                        circuit where stability is high, it has acquired the higher effect and
                        has realized the improvement of many characteristics, such as low noise-izing.
                        <br>
					
                        <br>
					
                        22,000micro of filter capacitors of fx2 are carried in the power-source
                        part with the large-sized power transformer of about 400 VA. <br>
					
                        <br>
					Since a straight signal course is constituted at the shortest, the logic 
relay control system has been adopted. <br>
					
                        Adopting the sealed type for communication industry as the relay used by
                        this system, a contact is the crossbar twin system plated with gold, and
                        has become a thing of low contact resistance and quantity durability which
                        has high quality. <br>
					
                        <br>
					The balance input is 
carried. <br>
					As for balance transmission, the sending side transmits 
simultaneously the signal which the phase reversed on the same voltage, and, in 
response, the receptacle side is compounded with + amplifier and - amplifier. In 
order that the noise ingredient generated in a cable at this time may go into 
two poles at this phase, if it is compounded, it will be canceled, and it 
disappears by a noise, and the purity of a music signal goes up it. <br>
					
                        <br>
					The 
remote commander who can change volume control and input sauce is carried. 
<br>
					Volume control enables smooth operation with the combination of high-quality 
sound and a volume controller, and a small motor with a clutch. <br>
					Moreover, an 
input selector controls a logic circuit by a commander. <br>
					
                        <br>
					The large-sized 
speaker terminal which corresponds also to a banana plug and can respond also to 
a thick speaker cable is carried. <br>
					
                        <br>
					
                        In E-210A, Phono equalizer amplifier is built in and it has the input circuit
                        in consideration of the characteristic of each MC/MM type cartridge for
                        exclusive use. <br>
					At the time of MM input, it 
constitutes from a low noise FET element which was excellent in the noise 
characteristic with high signal source impedance in consideration of an Output 
voltage and an Output load impedance being high. <br>
					Moreover, at the time of MC 
input, since a minute signal is received by low impedance, little reproduction 
of noise is enabled by constituting the difference input circuit by a low noise 
element, and attaining low impedance-ization of a NFB loop. <br>
					
                        <br>
					
                  There is a Phono equalizer amplifier board of E-210 exclusive use as an option, and upgrade to E-210A is possible.
