				<p class="detail">This control amplifier was created by completely refining the control amplifier C-10 by changing resistors and circuit constants.<br><br>An ultra-low-noise, high-density information resistor has been newly developed and fully introduced, and a 58-contact Super Ultimate Attenuator II, a 4-circuit 4-train type with a perfect balance, has been adopted.<br>Although 456 resistors are used, each volume setting is always composed of only two resistors (0 dB and one - ∞ position), and the signal purity is obtained by completely separating the other resistors.<br><br>It is equipped with CSSC and single stagger circuit of pure complimentary service configuration directly connected to all stages.<br>In the CSSC, the current transmission stage with the grounded base circuit in the second stage provides high cut-off frequencies and stable operation with minimum compensation. In addition, the two stage Darlington complimentary service emitter-follower circuit is used in the output-stage to keep the output impedance low and to provide sufficient signal energy to drive the power amplifier.<br>Using a fully balanced configuration that combines two CSSCs, the earth potential difference is completely eliminated, and the CSSC with a clear reference point is made into a balanced configuration, eliminating potential difference and phase difference on the time axis.<br><br>NFB is corrected separately into AC and DC regions. The DC region is relatively difficult to control and requires stronger correction than the AC region. Therefore, DC servo amplifiers have been used to improve the correction.<br>The C-10II adopts an OD β circuit that achieves sufficient DC stability without using a DC servo amplifier by refining the bare characteristics, which are the basic characteristics of the circuit.<br><br>The power supply section employs a large-capacity capacitor with instantaneous power supply capability developed independently by LUX INC. to build a power supply section with high inertial force that retains constant energy without being affected by fluctuations in the power supply flowing to the load.<br>In addition, the regulator circuit is the minimum NFB control necessary to keep the capacitor potential constant, eliminating the adverse effect on sound quality caused by excessive feedback.<br><br>Each part is firmly mounted on a 5-point contact FRP chassis base to eliminate adverse effects such as unnecessary vibration.<br>In addition, the internal structure adopts a box isolation structure in which sections with different roles are separated by shielding plates. In particular, the power supply unit blocks leakage flux by storing the power supply unit in an individual unit, and the entire power supply room is separated from the main chassis by anti-vibration materials to eliminate all noise components from both electromagnetic and mechanical aspects from the power supply unit.<br><br>It is equipped with an enhanced noise filter to ensure high-purity sound quality against high-frequency noise emitted from PCs and microcomputer equipment and noise mixed through power supply.<br><br>From custom resistors for exclusive use, to small-capacity capacitors, copper-foil Styrofoam capacitors with copper shields, to sealed gold-plated contact relays used for switching signal systems, parts with special specifications of Lux are used.<br><br>It is equipped with coaxial Route 6 and two balanced input / output systems, two coaxial and two balanced output systems, and two tape-type input / output systems.<br>Both coaxial and balanced can be selected for bi-amplifier drive.<br><br>Like a high-end model, the front panel is machined out of aluminum and has a champagne gold finish.<br>A wooden cabinet is also used.<br><br>Equipped with a line phase sensor that senses the polarity of the AC power supply.<br>This allows you to always set the correct polarity.</p>
