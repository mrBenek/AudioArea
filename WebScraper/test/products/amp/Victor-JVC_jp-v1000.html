				<p class="detail">A 4-channel control amplifier of the Laboratory 1000 series specially developed for professional use such as studios.<br><br>The Laboratory 1000 Series was designed and manufactured by selected staff members of the Victor Laboratory Center. The characteristics of the Series are compensated by the measured data of all the machines, and the specifications can be changed slightly according to the purpose.<br>In addition to using highly reliable parts for all parts, it is checked up to one resistance and one knob.<br><br>The JP-V1000 is equipped with many functions, including four SEA controllers. It is equipped with control functions that support both two and four channels. In addition, the entire amplifier stage is equipped with a unique circuit system that was completed through thorough investigation of characteristics and hearing. This ensures high fidelity sound quality and reduces the influence of wiring by minimizing wires.<br><br>For the internal structure, the plug-in unit is adopted for the circuit board with an emphasis on serviceability for business use. In addition, the frequently used master volume and selector switch can be removed and replaced together with the board.<br><br>The amplifier circuit of the JP-V1000 has the same basic configuration except for the headphone amplifier, and has many features such as no crossover distortion observed in the SEPP circuit because the output stage is A-class single operation.<br>In particular, the Phono equalizer circuit achieves a bare gain of more than 90 dB by using a high voltage operation of ± 75 V, and a large dynamic range of up to 400 mV (RMS) and a very low distortion factor by using a negative feedback of 50 dB (1 kHz).<br>The SEA amplifier operates at ± 35 V, and the linearity has been improved by combining the newly designed permalloy shield High Legh near coil to take advantage of the circuit system.<br><br>The input selector is mounted on an independent board and can be removed and replaced.<br>In addition, the L and R wafers of Phono are separated and a shield plate is inserted between them to prevent signal jumping and increase of crosstalk.<br><br>Newly developed flexible wires are used to connect the input terminal board to the circuit board.<br>This flexible wire has a five layer structure based on a polyimide heat-resistant sheet, so that the board can be checked and removed while maintaining a good shielding effect.<br><br>It uses a 4-strand master trimming volume.<br>This volume combines the advantages of an attenuator and volume. It is a 315 degree wide-angle rotating volume with a 22-point click with extremely low tracking error. The 3 notches turned to the left are an attenuator that switches accurately in 10 dB steps, and more are ultra-precision volumes.<br>With this volume, there is little tracking error at low volume levels, and unlike the attenuator, there is no inconvenience of step-by-step volume changes at normal volume levels. In addition, since this volume is clickable, accurate reproduction of the same volume is provided.<br>In addition, it is mounted on the plug-in board in the same way as other operation parts, so the service manufacture is also improved.<br><br>Equipped with a sub-level volume that can individually adjust each of the 4 ch levels.<br><br>A 2.9 kg large toroidal transformer is used for the power supply section, and a constant voltage circuit with ± 75 v, ± 35 v and ± 25 v Route 3 supplies a stable power supply to all circuits.<br><br>It is equipped with four SEA circuits unique to VICTOR/JVC that divide the audible frequency into seven bands.<br>There are seven center frequencies, and the front and back channels can be adjusted separately with a double volume and an independent ON-OFF switch, and can be further reduced.<br><br>Equipped with a pink noise generation circuit that can be used for 4-channel phase check and level adjustment.<br>The phase switching of front back and left right is independent, and the phase can be checked between any of the four channels.<br><br>Equipped with a level meter corresponding to 4 ch.<br>This meter is a narrow-angle operation type that uses only the center part with good linearity of the magnetic circuit. The pointer moves in equilibrium. The meter is structured to indicate the input level as it is regardless of the master volume.<br><br>It has a headphone port for monitor.<br>There is also a headphone level control for headphones that operates independently of the master volume.<br><br>A cast-aluminum side frame is used to increase the rigidity of the body and achieve stable rack-mounting.<br>The mount size is BTS standard and can be changed to RCA type by order.<br><br>The power supply is a universal system of 100 V, 117 V, 220 V and 240 V. It can be used overseas simply by changing internal connections.</p>
