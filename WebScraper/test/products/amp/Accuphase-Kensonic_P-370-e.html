				<p class="detail">This is a stereo power amplifier that has inherited the design technology that has been cultivated over the years and has polished the sound quality by maturing the technology and sensitivity.<br><br>The output device uses a high-power transistor with a collector loss of 150W and a collector current of 15A that has excellent characteristics such as frequency characteristics, linearity of current amplification factor and switching. This transistor is composed of 3 parallel push-pull and is mounted on a large heat sink to realize effective heat radiation processing.<br>This realizes linear high output power up to ultra-low impedance loads.<br><br>It uses a current feedback amplifier circuit that feeds back the output signal in the form of current.<br>The principle of this circuit is that a current is detected by reducing the impedance of the input terminal on the feedback side, and the current is converted to I-V (current-voltage) by a transimpedance amplifier to produce an output signal.<br>Since the impedance of the feedback input part is extremely low, phase rotation hardly occurs, and as a result, there is almost no need for phase guarantee. Therefore, the characteristics can be greatly improved with a small amount of NFB, and a natural energy response with excellent dynamic characteristics such as rising is realized.<br><br>The power supply section uses a toroidal power transformer with a large power capacity of approximately 700 VA. In addition, it is fixed to the case using a filler with excellent heat conduction and anti-vibration effect to prevent external influence.<br>Toroidal transformers have features such as extremely low impedance, small size and high conversion efficiency because thick copper wire is wound around a doughnut-shaped core. The P-370 uses a super-ring type, and has excellent characteristics because the cross-section of the iron core is close to a circle and the coil is close to a circle and adhesion is good.<br>The aluminum electrolytic capacitor is equipped with two 47,000 μ F large-capacity capacitors.<br><br>It has an input terminal for balanced connection that is resistant to external induction noise.<br><br>It can also be used as a monaural power amplifier by bridge connection.<br>In the bridge connection method, two amplifiers with different polarities are fed with opposite phase signals, and a speaker is connected to the output terminals of both amplifiers. This way, more power can be supplied.<br>Use the mode selector switch on the rear panel. In the dual mono position, it can be used as an output for the center woofer or as a single channel signal output from both speakers for bi-amplifier drive.<br><br>Equipped with an analog type large power meter.<br>It also has a switch to turn on/off the meter operation and lighting.<br><br>Equipped with two speaker terminals that can be used with thick speaker cables.<br>Although it is normally used by switching, it is also possible to operate both A and B systems for bi-wiring connection.</p>
