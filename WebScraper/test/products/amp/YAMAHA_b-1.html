				<p class="detail">A stereo power amplifier using a vertical power FET for audio.<br><br>The B-I uses three types of vertical FETs and three types of horizontal FETs developed by Yamaha for audio applications. It uses 14 single-channel FETs and the signal path is an FET in all stages.<br><br>The circuit configuration consists of three stage differential amplifier, source follower symmetric drive system single push-pull OCL and SEPP system, all stages are directly connected. Vertical FETs are used for the drive and power stages, and vertical FETs are combined everywhere to form the circuit.<br>A dual horizontal FET is used for the input circuit, and a 0 dB gain pre-amplifier of all-stage FET configuration is built in. It has the function of impedance conversion for rumble filter, level control and remote control. It is designed to pass through this amplifier with a back switch.<br><br>The power amplifier uses a single push-pull high-power vertical FET with a drain loss of 300W (Tc = 25 ℃) at the output stage, a 3-stage differential drive circuit with all Yamaha FETs, and a direct-coupled drive with source follower at the final stage.<br>Since it is single push-pull with FET of the same channel, pair selection becomes easy, and since it is easy to balance the push-pull, stable operation is obtained.<br><br>In the B-I, the input / output characteristics of the FET close to the square characteristic reduces the odd order harmonic distortion of the third order or higher, which is easy to be heard. Moreover, the even order harmonic distortion is canceled by the push-pull circuit, so the sound quality with less distortion component is realized. In addition, the notch distortion caused by the carrier accumulation effect which occurs in the bipolar transistor amplifier is reduced in the FET amplifier, and the sound quality is improved.<br><br>Vertical FETs are used for the power stage and source follower that drives the power, a differential amplifier using a horizontal FET is used for the pre-drive stage that handles small signals, and a dual FET with particularly good characteristics is used for the input stage to realize an excellent circuit with less temperature drift and noise.<br>The power FET and drive FET are stabilized by a special bias method to keep the bias current of the power FET stable even in an unstabilized power supply. The use of a bootstrap circuit or electrolytic capacitor is avoided as much as possible, and a low-frequency time constant is reduced to improve transient characteristics.<br><br>The power supply section uses Lch/Rch independent drive with two power transformers. By using two completely independent large power transformers, there is no difference in output between drive for both channels and drive for one channel.<br>For the power supply capacitor of the power stage, a rated voltage of 100 VDC, surge voltage of 120 V DC, ripple resistant current of 15A and capacity of 15,000 μ Fx2 are used for one channel. The total capacity of both channels is 60,000 μ F.<br>For other power supplies, an automatic recovery type constant voltage power supply with a short-circuit protection circuit is adopted.<br><br>Equipped with speaker protection circuit, overcurrent / overload protection circuit, bias power circuit protection circuit, and thermal sense protection circuit, whose operation can be checked by the Over Load or Thermal indicator.<br><br>In the speaker protection circuit, when a DC voltage of ± 2 V or more is generated at the output of the power amplifier, a pure electronic DC detection circuit opens the contact of the speaker relay and disconnects the speaker from the amplifier.<br>This circuit also serves as a muting operation that prevents the speaker from generating transient noise that occurs when the power switch is turned ON/OFF. This circuit eliminates shock noise when the power is turned ON/OFF. When the DC voltage disappears, this circuit releases the protective circuit and automatically returns.<br><br>The overcurrent and overload protection circuit detects an overcurrent when a load is low (4 Ω or less) or when the load is short-circuited, and the ± B power supply supplied to the power FET is cut off by an electronic switch to protect the power FET and the power supply circuit.<br>Overcurrent overload protection is purely electronic and automatically returns when the fault or overload is removed.<br><br>Unlike bipolar transistors, FETs are destroyed by a large current (equivalent to IDSS) when no bias is applied between the gate and source. To prevent this, B-I is equipped with a bias current protection circuit with an automatic return type constant-voltage power supply with a short-circuit protection circuit. Thus, even if the bias current fails for some reason, ± B of the power supply for Power FET is cut off and the Power FET is protected.<br><br>The heat detection type protection circuit detects a temperature rise due to abnormal heat generation and shuts off the ± B power supply.<br>For other protection circuits, only the Over Load indicator lights, while for thermal protection circuits, both the Thermal and Over Load indicators light.<br><br>Two input circuits, normal and direct, are installed.<br>The normal input is equipped with an active filter with a cutoff frequency of 10 Hz and attenuation characteristics of 12dB/oct, which can be turned on / off with the switch on the rear panel. This circuit cuts out unwanted signals in the very low frequency range.<br><br>The specification range of B-I can be expanded by using the separately sold dedicated adapter UC-I.<br>The UC-I is equipped with a power switch, a filter switch, a Line 5 speaker selector that can be set individually, and a logarithmic compression peak level meter that can display from -50dB to + 5 dB without range switching.<br>The peak indication power level meter circuit was developed specifically to display the peak value of a signal up to one wave with high accuracy. The 10 kHz limit has high indication characteristics with an indication error of less than -2dB even for one wave. The meter circuit is composed of a logarithmic compression circuit and a linear detection circuit in one non-feedback loop to reduce the indication error due to the fluctuation of the elements in the detection circuit. Two logarithmic amplifiers share signals of -30dB or less and -30dB or more. The display error of each level is kept small and a wide range can be displayed without switching.<br>The UC-I can be used in two ways : as a remote control center and attached to the main unit.</p>
