				<p class="detail">This is a low-cost stereo power amplifier that inherits the music playback capability of the PA-70.<br><br>It has the same circuit configuration as the PA-70, and the power transformer and electrolytic capacitor have been changed.<br><br>The STASIS circuit is used to realize the ideal of perfect speaker drive.<br>The most important feature of the STASIS circuit is that it enables high-quality signal transmission while eliminating the overall NFB with an extremely simple circuit. Since there is no loop for returning from output to input, it is free from problems associated with the complicated behavior of speakers and realizes extremely stable operation. In addition, since the anti-oscillation coil used in general amplifiers is not required, uniform output impedance is obtained in all bands.<br>In a power amplifier, the amplifier element must supply current according to the impedance of the speaker. Since this impedance always fluctuates during music playback, the current supply at the output stage also changes. In addition, since the voltage fluctuates depending on the level of the music signal, it is also necessary to supply current according to this voltage fluctuation. When the amount of current changes in this way, the amplification factor of the amplifier element at the output stage inevitably changes, making linear voltage amplification impossible and causing distortion. Therefore, in order to perform linear transmission without relying on feedback methods such as NFB and other distortion improvement technologies, the fluctuation of the amplification factor of the amplifier element itself must be suppressed.<br>The STASIS circuit solves this problem by driving the speakers in parallel with a two part output stage consisting of a STASIS section that amplifies the voltage under conditions with reduced current fluctuations and a current mirror bootstrap section that supplies the current required by the speakers.<br>The current mirror bootstrap section, which supplies current to the speakers, has a very high impedance relative to the STASIS section because it is a collector follower and has little power to control the voltage, so it has a negligible effect on the quality of the signal transmission. Instead, it promises stable operation for the inductance component of the speakers, and moreover, high current supply capability is obtained by utilizing the capability of the transistor with efficient class AB operation.<br>In the STASI section, the total quality is controlled by operating with a small power while maintaining pure A-class operation so as to compensate for nonlinear distortion in the current mirror bootstrap section.<br>These configurations provide an overwhelming degree of driveability to control various speakers.<br><br>In order to utilize the potential of the STASIS circuit, an output stage configuration with a margin is adopted.<br>The PA-50 uses 20 power transistors, of which two per channel are used in the STASIS section, which is the voltage amplification stage for pure class A operation, and the rest are used in the current mirror bootstrap section, which is the current supply section.<br>This current feed section uses a high-power transistor with a Pc (collector loss) of 130W with four parallel push-pull per channel, and is connected with collector followers with low transmission loss to ensure excellent current feed capability of peak 35A.<br>In addition, a LAPT (Multi-Emitter Power Transistor) element that boasts high-speed response is used for the transistor in order to achieve high linearity and high speed.<br><br>Since the NFB is applied only slightly to the voltage amplification stage and does not have an overall loop, no output coil is required to prevent oscillation, thereby achieving a uniform output impedance in the entire audible band up to high frequencies.<br><br>The power supply section uses a large 450W power transformer to improve the S/N ratio and adopt a toroidal method with less leakage flux. The transformer is surrounded by a magnetic shield made of silicon steel plate.<br>The filter condenser has a large capacity of 94,000 μ F in total. In order to improve high-frequency impedance in particular, we use hard high-purity aluminum foil for both electrodes. In addition, solid aluminum is used for the terminals, and the connection method between the terminals and aluminum foil also takes into consideration sound quality. In addition, we use a chemical conversion method that is superior in sound quality for the oxide film, which is a dielectric, and an electrolyte that is high-speed, low-strain, and excellent in temperature stability.<br><br>It uses parts that have been tested repeatedly and carefully.<br>First, we use metal film resistors whose characteristics are extremely stable against temperature changes for all resistors whose sound quality is highly affected. We also select capacitors after careful examination of sound quality. We use film capacitors for particularly important parts. These film capacitors are made of polyester film with low induction loss. They are wound tightly at low speed with high tension to prevent wrinkles and stress. To prevent external influences, we use black epoxy in the aluminum case to provide shielding and vibration protection.<br>&quot;Monster Special&quot; extra-thick internal wiring cable manufactured by Monster Cable USA is used for the wiring of the signal system and power supply. In addition, the material of the protective fuse is also taken into consideration. The fuse wire is made of copper alloy with low shrinkage and the entire fuse tube is hardened with ceramic powder to prevent vibration.<br><br>The binding post type is used for the gold plated speaker terminal.<br>The input terminal is also gold-plated to prevent aging.<br><br>In addition to the signal transmission circuit, the left and right sides are equipped with independent protection circuits that constantly monitor the operation status.<br>This realizes both high current supply capability and safe operation without adversely affecting sound quality.<br><br>Equipped with an inrush current limiter that protects the transformer and breaker from a large amount of current that flows when the power is ON.<br><br>Uses an extremely thick oxygen-free copper power cord with polarity indication.</p>
