				<p class="detail">AV amplifier equipped with Dolby Pro Logic and 5-channel power amplifier.<br><br>It is compatible with Dolby Pro Logic Surround, and by surround playback using 5 speakers of front 2 ch, center ch and rear 2 ch with built-in directional enhancement circuit, you can enjoy video software recorded with Dolby Pro Logic in the stereoscopic sound field of movie theaters or theaters.<br>The AX-V707 supports four pro-logic modes : three center modes and three channel logic.<br><br>It is equipped with 3 modes of surround sound and 3 types of delay time in which you can enjoy the sound field effect with realistic feeling even with sources other than Dolby surround sound.<br><br>The D/A converter is equipped with a newly developed DD (Digital Direct) converter.<br>The DD converter is a type of 1-bit D/A converter that converts digital signals into 1-bit pulse waves that vary based on the crystal clock, and directly converts them into analog signals. Because the bits are not stacked, the 0 cross distortion caused by amplitude error that occurs in conventional ladder-type D/A converters does not occur in principle, greatly improving the ability to reproduce at a minute level.<br>The DD converter consists of three parts : 8 x oversampling digital filter + VANS 4th-noise shaper + PEM DAC. The newly developed VANS noise shaper compresses the data output from the digital filter into data suitable for the 1-bit PEM DAC. The requantization noise generated at this time is eliminated by 4th-noise shaping for the first time in the 1-bit DAC. Thus, the dynamic range is expanded. The PEM DAC converts the input data into high-precision, high-resolution pulse waves that vary with the crystal clock and directly converts them into analog signals.<br><br>The digital input has a total of four systems, one optical system and a coaxial Route 3 system.<br><br>The power amplifier section is equipped with a 5-channel power amplifier of complete discrete configuration.<br>In addition, the front two channels are equipped with Dynamic Super A so that the sound quality is emphasized.<br><br>The power amplifier section is surrounded by a heat sink in the internal construction to shield the delicate input signal processing section from noise, and the power transformer is mounted via a vibration control base to eliminate vibration.<br><br>The AC cord is made of oxygen-free copper wire and the power condenser is made of carefully selected materials in pursuit of higher sound quality.<br><br>The CD analog input minimizes the signal path and reduces the number of contacts, thus reducing sound quality degradation.<br><br>All of the Route 6 video inputs are equipped with S-video terminals, one of which is installed on the front panel for easy connection of video equipment, and the audio input is equipped with Route 6.<br><br>Equipped with an AV independent REC selector.<br><br>It is equipped with a multi-mode display which displays the operation status of the amplifier in text such as source and surround mode selection, level adjustment, etc.<br>It is also equipped with an on-screen function that displays the operation status on the TV screen so that you can see at a glance what you are listening to, what you are recording or recording, and in what surround mode you are enjoying. The usage status of the speaker is displayed graphically, and the levels of the center channel and rear channel are displayed on a 7-level graph.<br><br>Equipped with a test tone function, you can adjust the speaker volume balance.<br><br>A built-in Y/C separation circuit makes editing from composite input to S-image input convenient.<br>It is also equipped with an enhancer that can correct image contours.<br><br>There are 2 color variations, gun metallic and black.<br><br>A programmable remote controller is included as a remote controller to control other AV devices.<br>This remote control is equipped with a learning function, and can store up to 174 types of remote control signals for up to 18 models, including VTRs, TVs, video disks, BS tuners, CDs, DAT, and decks.</p>
