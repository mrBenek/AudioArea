          Based on Acuphase's unique balance transmission technology, this stereo preamplifier aims at a new age by simplifying the design and circuit aspects, and by using carefully selected elements and thoroughly polished performance and sound quality. <br>
          <br>
          The line amplifier uses a unique balanced transmission method. <br>
          Balanced transmission is a method of simultaneously transmitting positive and negative symmetric signals whose phases are inverted with each other. It is excellent in the ability to remove the noise component of advisory mode. <br>
          The C-250 basically consists of three differential amplifiers. When balanced, the signals from the + - inputs of Amp 1 are amplified and then fed to Amp 2 and Amp 3. These two amplifiers are connected to each other by feeding their outputs back to the other side. They transmit + - symmetric signals with low impedance. <br>
          This circuit is an ideal circuit system in which the + - symmetric signal is floated from the ground. Even if one side of the output is grounded, both amplifiers are differential and the output voltage does not change. Therefore, in a normal unbalanced connection, either input or output is simply connected to the ground line. <br>
          <br>
          The main circuit of the C-250 consists of a total of 6 unit left and right amplifiers including a line amplifier, a balanced input / output amplifier and a balanced output amplifier, and is located on the motherboard. <br>
          In order to prevent mutual interference between these unit amplifiers, each unit amplifier is surrounded by a thick extruded aluminum material, and the structure is strong against resonance due to external vibration. <br>
          <br>
          The power supply section has a completely monaural configuration with independent power transformers, left and right filters and capacitors to eliminate crosstalk between channels and prevent mutual interference between amplifiers. <br>
          <br>
          The volume regulator uses a resistor with a particularly low distortion factor. This resistor is mirror-finished and has low contact resistance and excellent abrasion resistance. <br>
          The brush that contacts the resistor is a gold-plated multi-contact type. It is integrated with the external terminal to eliminate the metal joint surface and reduce the strain caused by contact of different metals. <br>
          In addition, the rotation method is not a method in which the brush rotates, but a structure in which the resistor rotates by fixing the brush is adopted. This greatly reduces the internal contact points and eliminates the need for contact grease, improving durability. <br>
          <br>
          The input selector uses AccuPhase's original logic relay control system that uses a sealed type relay containing nitrogen gas for the communication industry. <br>
          In this system, relays are installed where switching is necessary and controlled electronically by logic circuits. The precise timing is controlled by a microprocessor and there is no noise when switching. <br>
          <br>
          It is equipped with a special amplifier for headphones, and the sound quality of headphones is also taken into consideration. <br>
          You can turn off the output to the speakers with the switch and adjust the headphone output with the main volume. <br>
          <br>
          Comes with a remote control that allows you to switch the input source and adjust the volume. <br>
          The input selector is a relay switching system, and the volume adjustment is combined with a small motor with a clutch to prevent adverse effects on sound quality. <br>
          <br>
          The C-250 has a line-only configuration, but the phono equalizer unit (sold separately) allows for analog recording.
