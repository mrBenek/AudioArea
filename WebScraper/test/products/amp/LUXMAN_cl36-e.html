				<p class="detail">As a revised version of CL36, a bulb-tube type control amplifier was created with extensive modifications including sound quality, mechanism, and function.<br><br>The equalizer circuit uses a 3-stage K-K ・ NF method (negative feedback is applied from the third stage cathode to the first stage cathode). The output stage is not a cathode follower but an SRPP (Shunt Regulated Push-Pull) circuit to reduce distortion.<br>This SRPP output circuit is characterized by high input impedance and low output impedance due to its large output voltage and excellent distortion factor characteristics compared with the cathode follower output circuit.<br>The first and second stages use a specially selected low-noise type 12AX7 to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. In addition, careful consideration is given to setting the operating point of the equalizer circuit to improve the distortion factor characteristics, such as canceling waveform distortion mutually.<br><br>The flat amplifier circuit employs the 3-stage K-K ・ NF method as well as the equalizer circuit to reduce the distortion factor over the entire band. The output stage is a cathode follower circuit, so the input impedance is high. The load condition of the second stage is adjusted, so the distortion factor characteristics and input resistance characteristics are improved. The output impedance is also sufficiently low, ensuring stability that is not affected by the severe load condition to be connected later.<br>When you defeat the tone control circuit, the output is taken directly from this circuit, and a low-boost circuit using an NF element is inserted into this flat amplifier circuit.<br><br>The tone control circuit adopts LUX&#39;s unique 2-stage K-G ・ NF method (negative feedback is applied from the cathode of the second stage cathode follower stage to the grid of the first stage). The LUX method NF type tone control is followed by the cathode follower stage to adjust the load condition of the preceding stage. Thus, the tone control circuit achieves both excellent change characteristics and low distortion rate characteristics over all bands. The frequency curve point switching is provided at 3 points for low band and high band respectively.<br>Since the output stage of this control circuit is a cathode follower, the output impedance is sufficiently low, making it an excellent output stage of a control amplifier.<br><br>As for the power supply circuit, the B+ power supply circuit is set to a constant voltage to supply a stable power supply to each amplifier circuit, and a DC ignition system using a constant voltage circuit is also adopted for the power supply for the heater to prevent mixing of pulse noise.<br><br>The headphone amplifier circuit uses a pure complimentary service OCL system.<br><br>The ultra-low frequency filter circuit uses a twin T-type filter combined with a CR1-stage filter to minimize the effect on the audible frequency band without using active elements and to obtain sharp attenuation characteristics.<br>The cut-off frequency can be selected in 2 levels of 10 Hz and 30 Hz to effectively remove ultra-low frequency noise.<br><br>As with the ultra-low frequency filter, the high-frequency filter circuit uses an LC-type filter composed only of coils and capacitors without active elements. It has two cut-off frequencies of 12 kHz and 18 kHz, and can eliminate noise such as tape hissing and FM tuner carrier-leak.<br><br>Acoustic control is installed to effectively remove standing waves generated in the listening room.<br>This circuit consists of two stages, a twin T-type circuit combined with a cathode follower circuit as a buffer. By controlling the dip frequency adjustment (knob that continuously changes the dip frequency between 75 Hz and 150 Hz) and the dip amount adjustment (knob that continuously changes the dip amount between 0 dB and -12dB), standing waves unnecessary for music playback are effectively removed.<br>When using this circuit, output is taken out from the Pre out2 terminal.<br><br>The low-boost switch has a two point turnover frequency and can boost the lower range.<br>In addition, it is equipped with functions such as a two channel tape monitor circuit, a tape dubbing function, a rec out off function to disconnect the recording output terminal, a -20dB attenuator, a time muting circuit to disconnect the output circuit until full operation is achieved, and a blinker to let you know that preparation is in progress.<br><br>In addition to simplifying the signal path by adopting a chassis structure that is thought to be reasonable, we are positively introducing the use of printed circuit boards to improve and stabilize the characteristics.<br>In order to minimize the input circuit distance, a special relay for small signals is used to switch the input between the Phono terminal and the equalizer circuit. The shield wire of the input circuit is almost eliminated and various characteristics are improved. The power supply for driving the relay is constant voltage to suppress unnecessary noise.<br><br>A new multi-slider type continuously variable volume is adopted for volume such as volume, balance control and tone control.<br>We also use film capacitors and condensers with improved sound quality for coupling capacitors, and select highly accurate switches for switches.<br><br>Equipped with a dedicated socket for use of step-up transformer (8000 series) for MC cartridge sold separately.<br><br>There was a wood case sold separately.</p>
