          This is the fifth model of the C-200 series. <br>
          Based on full amplification stage push-pull drive, it is composed of cascode, bootstrap and complimentary service class A push-pull circuit. <br>
          <br>
          The amplifier consists of a constant current load and FET buffer input with fet buffer input with a cascode bootstrap to reduce heavy noise and lower distortion factor. Next, a class A class Cascode differential push-pull and a class A class Cascode push-pull drive the Darlington class A push-pull output. <br>
          The feature of the cascode connection is that there is little feedback between input and output, and good characteristics can be obtained especially in the high frequency range. Also, the gain is large, linearity is maintained up to the operating limit of the element, distortion is reduced, and S/N is improved. <br>
          In addition, the important power supply section is reinforced with a full-scale constant-voltage power supply circuit on each of the left and right channel boards. <br>
          <br>
          An equalizer amplifier is used to play back analog disks. <br>
          The MC/MM switching is performed by changing the gain. However, a dedicated input circuit is provided to match the characteristics of each cartridge and the switching is performed simultaneously. The performance is comparable to that when using a head amplifier dedicated to MC. <br>
          In addition, it is equipped with MC LOAD switching which selects the load resistance according to the impedance of the MC cartridge, and you can choose from 3 types of 10, 30 and 100 Ω. <br>
          In addition, the power supply section is strengthened by installing a full-scale constant-voltage power supply. <br>
          <br>
          In order to suppress the deterioration of sound quality caused by routing the signal path by functions such as input switching and tape monitoring, the relay is electronically controlled by a logic circuit for switching to form the shortest and straight signal path. <br>
          A sealed audio-only relay is used to improve reliability and long-term durability. <br>
          <br>
          A presence equalizer is provided for program equalization. <br>
          It has a 4-point, 6-type frequency range for the most effective adjustment of music expression. <br>
          The mid-range has center frequencies of 500 Hz and 2 kHz, 500 Hz controls the expression of the rhythm instruments, and 2 kHz controls the vocals. The value that determines the sharpness of the peak is the value that gives the most natural variation from the audition results of the program source. <br>
          You can select two different frequencies for bass and treble to adjust the overall energy balance and atmosphere. <br>
          The presence equalizer is composed of a combination of additive filters, and the elements are carefully selected for sound quality. <br>
          The presence equalizer is designed to be out of the signal path when it is OFF. <br>
          <br>
          It is equipped with a Loudness Compensator switch that adjusts the sound perception and energy balance during low volume playback. <br>
          You can choose between two curves depending on the playback level and listening room characteristics. <br>
          Volume adjustment Adjusts the amount of compensation automatically according to the position of the volume. <br>
          <br>
          Three tape recorders (one of which is in the front subpanel) can be connected, and mutual dubbing is also possible. <br>
          <br>
          Equipped with balanced input and output circuits. <br>
          <br>
          The top of the front panel is a traditional AccuPhase gold-style scratch hairline and the bottom sub-panel is a black hairline. <br>
          In addition, natural Persimmon sideboards are installed on both sides.
