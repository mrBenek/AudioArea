				<p class="detail">Based on TA-F555ESX, this pre-main amplifier has been improved by hardening the transformer with a zinc die-cast cover and reviewing the part layout.<br><br>Pursuing the ideal of non-vibration and non-resonance design, we have adopted an Advanced Furniture Tuned G (Gibraltar) chassis that thoroughly pursues the material selection, shape and structure.<br>In the G chassis, calcium carbonate, the main component of marble, is added to unsaturated polyester and reinforced with glass fiber. Compared with metal, this material has superior vibration damping characteristics with greater internal loss, high strength, and high precision machining is possible. By shaping this material into an acoustically well-examined shape, excellent rigidity is obtained.<br>The G-chassis is designed so that each part of the chassis is thick enough, ribs are provided vertically and horizontally to increase rigidity, and the thickness of the ribs and the spacing between ribs are varied randomly to avoid specific resonance modes.<br>As a result, external vibration and vibration from the power supply are suppressed, and signal modulation due to resonance of the audio circuit is reduced. In addition, since this material is non-magnetic and non-metallic, it does not generate electro-striction and eddy current induced by magnetic fields of transformers and condensers, etc., and the deterioration of sound quality is reduced from an electrical point of view. In addition, since this material is heat-resistant, changes over time such as expansion and contraction due to temperature difference can be ignored.<br><br>Based on the G-chassis, each part is made more rigid when mounted.<br>The main parts of the audio circuit, such as the printed circuit board and power transformer, are directly attached to the G chassis and firmly fixed. The heat sink is made of large extruded aluminum and is firmly fixed to the G chassis with a plate of sufficient thickness. In addition, anti-vibration measures are taken to reduce the inherent noise of the heat sink. Moreover, the mounting section of the power transistor is as thick as 10 mm, allowing sufficient allowance for heat dissipation characteristics and strength.<br>In addition, the front chassis, terminal panel and case are mounted on the G chassis with connecting angles at important points so that they reinforce each other. This realizes a stronger chassis structure. The synergistic effect of making each part rigid suppresses noise pollution caused by unnecessary vibration.<br><br>S. T. D. (Spontaneous Twin Drive) power supply is used for the power supply part.<br>In the S. T. D. power supply, the rectifier circuits of the A-class stage and the power stage that make up the power amplifier are independent. The A power supply for the A-class stage and the B power supply for the power stage are installed. This allows the A-class stage to operate stably without interference from the power stage even at high output.<br>In the TA-F555ESXII, the electrolytic capacitor of the rectifier circuit is equipped with a total of 24,000 μ F in A-class stage and a total of 36,000 μ F in power stage, and the power transformer is equipped with two 350 VA-class large-capacity transformers.<br><br>The electrolytic capacitors that make up the rectifying circuit are designed to minimize the noise of foils and are carefully selected for sound quality. In addition, the electrolytic capacitors in the ESXII series are tightened with an integrated vibration-proof platform to eliminate vibration.<br>In addition, the power transformer is firmly tightened with a zinc die-cast frame to reduce the vibration of the transformer.<br><br>Equipped with an ES filter to prevent noise from the AC line.<br><br>The tone circuit consists of only passive elements, and the amplifier circuit consists of only two parts, the phono equalizer and the power amplifier.<br><br>The S. L. L. (Super Legato Linear) method is used in the power amplifier section to reduce the switching distortion and crossover distortion of the output stage in a wide band / wide dynamic range. This not only reduces the distortion factor at the effective output but also improves the distortion factor at the reproduction level in actual use.<br><br>The phono equalizer amplifier for the MC cartridge has an excellent high-frequency response and uses a low-noise Hi-gmFET to eliminate TIM distortion. The TA-F555ESXII has a 3-position cartridge load selector of MM/MC40 Ω / MC3 Ω.<br><br>Equipped with a TONE switch that can pass through the tone circuit and can switch the turnover frequency.<br><br>There is a source direct switch. Pressing this switch jumps through the tone control, subsonic filter, balance, mode switch, etc. The input signal is output through the shortest path between the attenuator and the power amplifier.<br><br>A remote-type rotary switch is used for the Input selector and Rec out selector, greatly reducing the amount of wire that needs to be routed, and ensuring simple and straight transmission.<br><br>Equipped with an adapter terminal that is convenient for connecting a graphic equalizer, etc.</p>
