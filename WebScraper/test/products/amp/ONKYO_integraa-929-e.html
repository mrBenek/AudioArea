				<p class="detail">Based on the Integra A-927, this is a high-grade pre-main amplifier with higher quality.<br><br>By eliminating NFB from the power amplifier stage of the power amplifier section, a low distortion factor is achieved over the entire band without relying on NFB.<br>In addition, the thermal stability has been improved by reviewing the temperature compensation circuit, and there is no need for a small resistor inserted in series on the output side of the normal amplifier, and the output impedance of the power amplifier has been reduced.<br><br>The power supply is equipped with a double-core laser transformer which is an evolution of the well-established laser transformer.<br>In this transformer, magnetic leakage is further reduced by combining two coil cores that are continuous in the rolling direction with the least magnetic resistance. In addition, by cutting off part of the core, the coil can be made into a cylindrical shape, making it possible to wind extremely thick copper wires without difficulty. This improves the power supply capability and realizes a power supply section that is resistant to instantaneous changes and continuous large current.<br>In addition, the A-929 double-core laser transformer is tightly shielded and filled with special resin to prevent it from being affected by internal and external vibrations. It is also mechanically firmly fixed.<br>Blue capacitors are also used as block capacitors.<br><br>The tone control includes Midbass Presence in addition to Bass/Treble.<br>It can cut the middle and low frequencies from 200 Hz to 300 Hz, which cannot be corrected with conventional tone control, so it is possible to eliminate the uncomfortable feeling of congestion caused by the shape and size of the room and to complement the reality of the vocals.<br>You can also make effective adjustments when you boost the bus control and it is difficult to hear because it is also boosted to the middle and low frequencies.<br>In addition, the Treble control is a double-axis type that can be adjusted independently on the left and right.<br><br>It is equipped with a direct selector that bypasses the tone circuit. In addition to the tone position and direct position, it is also equipped with a power amplifier direct position that can be input directly to the power amplifier from the dedicated terminal via the volume only.<br>The A-929 uses a top-in terminal to provide a higher-quality power amplifier direct. This allows pin terminals to be located close to the volume, minimizing internal wiring.<br>Also, the terminal cover is designed to prevent loss and to be used as a cable clamper.<br><br>The volume uses a 4-series detent volume that can be configured with dedicated circuits for tone position and direct position respectively.<br>Assuming that this volume is actually used at home, the rise of the attenuation curve has been made gradual and the input sensitivity has been revised to obtain the lowest operational feeling.<br><br>WIMA film capacitors and high-precision carbon resistors are used in the main parts related to sound quality.<br>The copper foil used for printed circuit boards, which make up major circuits, is 70 microns thick, twice as thick as ordinary copper foil, in an effort to improve quality.<br><br>A speaker terminal made by WBT of Germany is used for the speaker terminal.<br>The structure is a vise type and can be connected securely without damaging the core wire. In addition, banana plug can also be inserted.<br><br>Power cable, 2 mm<sup>2</sup>It comes with an OFC (Oxygen Free Chamber) cabtire cable and adopts an inlet method (power input connector) based on IEC standard.<br><br>The internal structure is designed to minimize the signal path from input to output and to construct a reasonable power supply line.<br>Each block has a rigid box-shaped structure and is connected to each other to increase the strength of the chassis as a whole. In addition, with an emphasis on vibration analysis, irregular ribs are provided everywhere to ensure strength and disperse resonance.<br><br>The MM/MC phono equalizer is also available for analog players.<br><br>Equipped with a step-type balance control, Rec selector and subsonic filter.<br><br>MDF is used for the hood to protect the sides and top.</p>
