          This is an authentic pure A class stereo power amplifier that Accuphase has developed since its establishment and put in the highest grade elements and audio technology, pursuing the ideal of reproduction music. <br>
          <br>
          The output stage employs a power MOS FET with a reputation for sound quality and reliability. N-channel power MOS
          Push-pull configuration in which FET and P-channel power MOS FETs are each connected in 10-parallel. <br>
          The allowable loss power of one MOS FET is 120W, and the power load per pair is 5W due to the 10-parallel connection.
          It is easy to use the low power region with excellent linearity of FET, and the high current by pure class A operation is reduced to 1/10, improving the stability of the whole circuit. <br>
          A large heat sink made of aluminum die-cast is used for heat treatment in class A operation to improve stability. <br>
          Furthermore, by using a power MOS FET in the drive stage, the switching speed is increased, and at the same time, the negative feedback system is lighter and the sound quality is improved. <br>
          The maximum clipping level is set to 100W (8 Ω) to save the momentary pulses that sometimes appear in the music signal from clipping. <br>
          <br>
          The input stage has a balanced differential pure complimentary service push-pull configuration, and FET buffers with high input impedance and low output impedance are used for the + (non-inverted) and - (inverted) input circuits, respectively. <br>
          An important part of this input circuit is modularized by large 60mmx35mm hybrid ICs. A symmetric circuit is placed on the base of the alumina ceramics to improve the temperature and noise characteristics. <br>
          In addition, the IC is covered with thick aluminum to protect it from external influences. <br>
          <br>
          It can be used as a monaural power amplifier with bridge connection. <br>
          Bridge connection is a method in which two amplifiers are supplied with signals of the same voltage and opposite phases and a speaker is connected to the output terminals of both amplifiers. When an 8 Ω load is connected, it is possible to obtain twice the output of 4 Ω stereo drive. <br>
          The bridge connection of A-50 utilizes the polarity of the differential inputs of two amplifiers. By changing the connection so that the opposite phase signals are input to each other, a pure switching circuit without inserting a phase inversion circuit is constructed. <br>
      <br>
      In addition to the normal RCA pin jack input, there is a full-scale balanced input. The XLR-type connector allows connection to devices with balanced outputs. <br>
For the balance input of A-50, the signal is directly injected into the non-inverting (+) and inverting (-) inputs of the differential input circuit. For this reason, a 2-channel attenuator with 1-dB steps is used as the attenuator. <br>
This attenuator is a high-quality type with a mirror finished resistor that has a particularly low distortion factor and excellent wear resistance. <br>
<br>
High-purity copper is used for the part where the signal passes. The metal plate is made of gold to reduce the skin resistance and smooth the current flow. <br>
In addition, gold plates are applied to the oxygen-free copper plates used for the parts that handle large currents, and high-purity wire materials are used for the shield coat around the attenuator to improve sound quality. <br>
<br>
The power supply section uses a high-efficiency toroidal transformer with a high power capacity of 1000 VA. The transformer is enclosed in an aluminum die-cast case and fixed inside with a resin with an elastic coefficient that suppresses vibration, thereby preventing external effects. <br>
The smoothing capacitor is a large capacitor of 56,000 μ Fx2 (charge capacity 3.5 clone x2). Ordinary capacitors are insulated with a vinyl sleeve, but the A-50 is made with a flexible soft coating called urethane coating (Fantas-Coat) to resist vibration. <br>
<br>
Equipped with power meter with digital display. <br>
The meter circuit displays a power value based on the mounted impedance of the speaker, detects current and voltage, uses an analog multiplier to calculate the power, and sends this value from the A/D converter to the microcomputer for digital display. <br>
The display stationary time (hold time) can be switched between 1 second and infinite (∞) time. It can also be turned off when the display is not required. <br>
<br>
Uses ultra-large speaker terminals that can be used with very thick speaker cables. <br>
This terminal is machined from solid brass into a gold plate, covered with a mold cap for insulation, and a banana-type plug can be inserted.</p>
