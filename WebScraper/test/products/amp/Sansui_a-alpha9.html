				<p class="detail">This is an integrated amplifier that seeks sound quality equivalent to a full-size component by introducing as much technology as possible in this size.<br><br>The A - α 9 is equipped with the NEW Advanced Diamond differential circuit which realizes more excellent constant current effect and noise removal effect by adding FET elements to the Uilson current mirror constant current circuit.<br>The advanced diamond differential circuit is a combination of a diamond differential circuit and a Uilson current mirror circuit. The diamond differential circuit has a structure in which four transistors operate symmetrically with each other to obtain a powerful current. This is a high-speed and high-current response circuit unique to SANSUI. By adopting this circuit in the pre-drive stage, the instantaneous current supply capability to the driver stage and final output stage is improved.<br>Also, by adding a Uilson current mirror circuit to the input differential amplifier circuit, the current flowing through the two amplifier elements can be made equal. By adopting this circuit in the first stage of the power amplifier, the current flowing through the amplifier element is always kept constant, and noise caused by temperature change or asymmetry of elements is suppressed.<br>By using the Advanced Diamond differential input circuit in the first stage, the FET differential amplifier in the input stage can be operated in an ideal manner. In addition, the circuit noise caused by temperature changes and element asymmetry is completely eliminated.<br><br>The output transistor uses LAPT (Linear Amplification Power Transistor) to improve the high-frequency stretch and response to sound.<br><br>Equipped with CD direct function.<br>With this function, the transmission circuit of the music signal is shortened to realize purer CD playback, and it is directly connected to the power amplifier. In addition, a relay switching method is adopted to prevent signal degradation due to contact.<br><br>Twin monaural construction is used for internal construction.<br>In this mechanism, the circuit board and radiator of the power amplifier, which consists of an advanced diamond differential circuit and LAPT, are integrated into L/R channels as completely independent units, eliminating interference between the left and right channels.<br><br>In order to eliminate various vibrations and resonance given to the circuit from inside and outside of the amplifier, pure copper isolation parts are adopted between the transformer and radiator, which are vibration sources, and chassis, and the transmission path of vibration is cut off.<br>In addition to the excellent vibration absorption capability of pure copper material, it has the advantage of being able to unify the tone and tone.<br><br>Copper plated rear panel and copper plated screws are used for the rear panel to receive input / output terminals and speaker terminals in order to suppress mutual interference between connected devices.<br><br>Side panel made of extruded aluminum is equipped as standard.<br>As the weight increases due to the mounting of the side panel, high damping performance is obtained against internal vibration and low-frequency vibration from the outside.<br>Gold-plated screws are used for mounting to the body.<br><br>Starget electrolytic capacitors are used as electrolytic capacitors.<br>This capacitor uses a newly developed acoustic chemical conversion coating that reduces the defects inside the film by 30% compared with conventional capacitors, and the new chemical conversion method reduces the amount of carbon contained in the electrolyte by 32% compared with conventional capacitors.<br>In addition, we have achieved high response by developing an electrolyte with less impurities.<br><br>The power supply section uses a heavyweight EI core transformer.<br><br>The power unit uses many audio-only parts such as Starget electrolytic capacitors.<br><br>The power cable uses an extremely thick power cable with polarity display equivalent to the AU - α series.<br><br>Uses a screw-type gold-plated speaker terminal that supports banana plugs.<br>Gold plated terminals are used for input / output terminals.<br><br>Equipped with a rotary 6-input input selector.<br><br>Equipped with a 3-mode presence control function that allows you to adjust the sound quality balance according to the listening condition at low volume and the characteristics of the combination speaker.<br><br>It has a processor jack that can be connected to a surround processor or an equalizer.<br><br>A 34-key remote controller with CD, DECK and TUNER control is included.</p>
