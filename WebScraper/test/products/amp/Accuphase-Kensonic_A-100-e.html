Accuphase's pure Class-A monophonic power amplifier was born in pursuit of the ideal of music reproduction. <br>
      We use all of the development technology we have accumulated since our establishment and the highest grade materials to complete our products. <br>
      <br>
      In the output stage, an N-channel power MOS FET and a P-channel power MOS FET are each connected in 10-parallel, and the two are bridged together. <br>
      Although the rated output of 8 ohms is 100W, a total of 40 power MOS FETs are used in two units, and the total drain loss is 4kW, which is an overwhelming margin. <br>
      In order to cope with the large heat generation generated by pure Class A operation, we have made it possible to use the device in a variety of ways.
      The power amplifier assembly is made up of a thick aluminum block with the output elements, and then the block is attached to an extra-large heat sink made of extruded aluminum. <br>
      <br>
      Two unit amplifiers with push-pull drive in all stages are connected to the bridge, and the balanced configuration suppresses distortions generated inside the amplifiers and noise coming in from outside. <br>
      When balanced, signals are added to each of the + and - inputs, and the signals appear in opposite phases to each other at the output to create a fully balanced output. <br>
      When unbalanced, the signal is input to the + input terminal and the - input terminal is grounded. <br>
      In this way, no extra circuitry, such as a converter, is added at all, enabling homogeneous amplification in both balanced and unbalanced situations. <br>
      <br>
      The input stage has Accuphase's original balanced pure complementary push-pull configuration, and the + (non-inverted) and - (inverted) input circuits use FET buffers with high input impedance and low impedance outputs, respectively. <br>
      The important part of this input circuit has been converted into a large hybrid IC of 60 mm x 35 mm. <br>
      The target circuit is placed on top of the alumina magnetic base, which improves temperature characteristics and noise characteristics, and achieves high performance, long-term stability and high reliability. <br>
      The IC is covered with a thick aluminum material to block out external influences. <br>
      <br>
      The part where the signal passes through is made of copper. <br>
      In addition, gold plating is applied on top of this to reduce skin resistance and smooth the flow of current. <br>
      Especially for power amplifiers, oxygen-free cylinders are used to handle large currents, and gold plates are applied to these as well. <br>
      In addition, high purity wire is used for the shield cold around the attenuator to improve the sound quality. <br>
      <br>
      In order to cope with the heat generated by Class A amplifiers using natural air cooling, a large heat sink is required, with a total encompassing area of 16.4 liters and a total weight of about 20 kg on both sides. <br>
      This heat sink is finned for natural air cooling and has a handle in the center for resonance damping to prevent squealing. <br>
      The chassis is also made of 9mm-thick aluminum and has a strong structure. <br>
      <br>
            The power supply transformer is a high-efficiency toroidal structure, which is fixed to the die-cast aluminum case using a filler material with good thermal conductivity and high anti-vibration effect to block the influence to the outside. <br>
      The electrolytic capacitor for smoothing is similarly enclosed in a die-cast aluminum case with a 4mm thick die-cast aluminum case filled with a special fixing material for the electrolytic capacitor. <br>
      This increased rigidity makes it difficult for external influences to be transmitted. <br>
      <br>
      It uses ultra-large speaker terminals that can accommodate thick speaker cables. <br>
      The material is machined from solid brass and plated with gold, and then covered with a molded cap for insulation purposes. <br>
            Two sets of these are mounted in parallel so that they can be used with bi-wiring speakers. <br>
      The electrode is made of a 2 mm thick oxygen-free copper plate pressed into a gold plate. <br>
      <br>
      It is equipped with a large output meter that is convenient for monitoring. <br>
      Logarithmic compression allows you to see a wide dynamic range all at once, while capturing peaks so you know exactly what power you're getting. <br>
      It also has a switch to turn off the meter operation and proof.
