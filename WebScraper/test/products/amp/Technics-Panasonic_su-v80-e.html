				<p class="detail">A pre-main amplifier developed with SE-A100 and SU-C200 technologies.<br><br>The amplifier circuit is equipped with VC-4 amplifier configuration and ClassAA.<br>A ClassAA system is adopted in which a voltage-controlled amplifier and a current-driven amplifier are separated. In addition, a VC-4 amplifier configuration is adopted in which the left and right amplifiers are independent from each other. As a result, voltage control that is extremely faithful to the input signal and current supply that is sufficient for speaker drive are compatible.<br><br>A 300 VA high-power transformer is used for the power supply. The transformer is wound with oxygen-free copper wire made of the highest quality materials. A high-density and extremely thick winding has been realized by our unique perfectly aligned winding method. A coil 1.4 times larger than the conventional one can be wound in the same cross-sectional area. By this, we have succeeded in taking out one size larger than that of the same class core size.<br><br>A newly developed high-speed capacitor is used for the power supply unit.<br>This capacitor uses a new high-speed, low-strain electrolytic solution whose purity has been improved by more than two orders of magnitude through biotechnology, thereby reducing the deterioration of sound quality caused by the adhesion of small impurities contained in the electrolytic solution to the electrode.<br>High-purity low-magnification aluminum foil is tightly wound at low speed and high tension to improve high-frequency impedance and low-frequency audio characteristics. At the same time, vibration is prevented to reduce noise.<br><br>Equipped with an EAS (Extended Active Servo) power supply that applies the active servo power supply developed in the SE-A200.<br>In this circuit, the earth point is completely separated from the power supply section of the power amplifier, so that a stable current can always be sent to the pre-section without being affected by the large current of the power section. As a result, voltage stability superior to that of an in-vehicle battery and a high S / N ratio that is approximately 70 dB higher than that of conventional power supplies are obtained.<br><br>A 3-layer structure power transformer suspension is used to prevent vibration of the power transformer and completely eliminate distortion.<br>It has a three layer structure consisting of a 5 mm thick, 1 kg + lead alloy transformer base and rubber base layered on a heavyweight iron chassis. Three materials with different compliance effectively absorb vibration transmitted from the power transformer to the chassis and eliminate the cause of distortion.<br><br>ClassAA is also used for the phono equalizer amplifier.<br>By installing a SEPP output stage current drive amplifier with high current supply capability, the output signal is not affected by the impedance fluctuation of the RIAA element, and voltage amplification in the ideal A-class state is realized.<br>In addition, a high signal-to-noise ratio has been achieved by using dual ultra-low-noise FET differential amplification and a first stage high-rate circuit configuration with a cascode.<br><br>Equipped with a CD direct input switch, it can be directly connected to a tone amplifier without using an input selector.<br><br>In addition to seven input selectors, there are three tape terminals that can be used for connecting tape terminals and graphic equalizers. The AV2 terminal can also be connected from the front.<br>The selected source is identified by the indicator.<br><br>Equipped with dual recording function that allows simultaneous recording from two different sources to two decks.<br>You can record the source selected in the Rec Selector to tape1 or tape2 while recording another source selected in the Input Selector to tape3.<br><br>Microcomputer controlled electronic selector is adopted.<br><br>PCL volume is used for the volume.<br>This volume realizes low distortion and low noise by the adoption of ultra-precision resistor with mirror surface smoothing and multi-contact brush with gold plating.<br><br>Equipped with a small electrolytic capacitor for audio equipment.<br>As with high-speed capacitors, this capacitor uses new materials for electrolyte, electrode, and separator to improve the transparency and resolution of the high-frequency range.<br><br>Large speaker terminal is used.<br><br>A oxygen-free copper is used for the power cord with polarity indication.</p>
