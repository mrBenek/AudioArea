				<p class="detail">A DSP AV control amplifier developed to pursue the potential of CINE-DSP and aim for the ultimate in everything.<br><br>Equipped with the newly developed YSS-213 as a key device for sound field processing.<br>This large-scale LSI is an all-digital CINE-DSP processing LSI with 2-ch digital-in and 7-ch digital-out. It has a high-precision processing capability with an internal operation word length of 30 bits. It also allows various signal paths generated by the CINE-DSP to be freely configured, greatly simplifying external analog circuits.<br>Functionally, in addition to the Dolby Pro Logic decoder, double 4 ch, DSP, external expansion interface and equalizer, etc. are built in. In addition to the YSS-203 and YM-3413 of the AVX-2000DSP, peripheral circuits and functions are also integrated in one chip in an all-digital manner.<br><br>All the signal processing functions of the Dolby Pro-Logic Decoder are built into the YSS 213 to improve accuracy and reliability.<br>The auto-input balance, auto-azimuth control, directional enhancement circuit, and modified B-type NR are dedicated logic with microprogram in the internal ROM, and can switch sampling frequency at s-acute angle for digital interface.<br>In addition, the center mode control and noise sequencer functions can also be controlled externally, and the steering gain control and NR on-off are designed to give a high degree of freedom in applied behavior as well as in decoding operation according to the format.<br><br>In order to make the original input as important as possible, the main channel signal is output through the analog path with the effect off and HiFi-DSP sound field when the analog input is used. When the effect is on, the signal is adjusted to the optimum operating level of the A/D converter with the analog input trim, and then converted to digital by the high-precision 19-bit equivalent A/D system before entering the YSS-213.<br>At digital input, the YSS 213 is input via the digital interface IC. In this case, the digital input trim function also compensates for the difference in volume between each source.<br>The digital output that has been DSP-processed by the YSS 213 is further subjected to two digital equalizers for sound brightness and sound screen equalization for L, C, and R, and then converted to analog by an 18bitD/A converter.<br><br>The A/D system developed by Yamaha for professional equipment is installed for the first time for home use. Analog signals can be converted into digital signals in 16 bitPCM format or higher quality.<br>It consists of two A/D converters for large and small signals. Both outputs are managed inside the DSP so that data can be selected according to the level and used. As a result, the gain error between both is 10.<sup>-23</sup>This provides 19-bit equivalent low-level linearity and 114 dB dynamic range.<br><br>The D/A system is equipped with an advanced compound complementary 18bitD/A system that has excellent anti-jitter characteristics and minute signal reproducibility for AV sources with various jitter fluctuation factors.<br>This is due to the combined operation of a 10-bit DAC with 18-bit accuracy by high-precision laser trimming and a 1-bit DAC with low-order bits. By combining this with an 8-times oversampling digital filter, the sound quality performance of DSP is finally completed.<br><br>A total of 33 sound field programs (15 for AV and 18 for HiFi) are incorporated by improving the DSP processing capability. These sound field programs -generated from measured data.<br><br>Equipped with the Sound Brightness Control, you can adjust the screen transmission loss correction (high-band boost) used in some movie software with a 10-step property correction according to the ISO-B chain curve.<br><br>Equipped with a 3-band center channel parametric equalizer, you can adjust the sound quality by adjusting the frequency, level and Q when the center speaker is different from the L/R speaker.<br><br>The built-in soundscreen configuration allows you to compensate for losses when using the soundscreen with a 2-band parametric EQ, 6dB/oct for L/C/Rch, and a high-boost filter.<br>Also, it can be set to (off, C only on, L/C/R on) depending on the usage condition.<br><br>Equipped with split super woofer output, it is possible to reproduce the delicate left / right direction of heavy bass.<br>The low-frequency component of Cch is also divided by -3dB to the left and right.<br><br>Equipped with rear effect super woofer output, level can be adjusted with remote control.<br><br>Equipped with test tone for super woofer.<br><br>Equipped with a low-cut filter switch, when using a small speaker for the L/C/R, it cuts the unwanted low frequencies while maintaining a natural connection with the super woofer.<br><br>Equipped with an effect channel bus extension switch, it can extend + 6 dB at 80 Hz when using a small effect speaker. This function is separate for front and rear.<br><br>Input switching uses a mechanical rotary switch driven by a motor drive. The switch section is installed near the input terminal to reduce sound quality degradation.<br><br>For the DBS input, the center and surround input terminals are made easy so that it can handle the discrete 4 ch signal. In addition, the built-in 4 ch → 2 ch encoding circuit also enables CINE-DSP playback at the discrete 4 ch input.<br><br>The Video Monitor Out and Video Rec Out have built-in adaptive Y/C separation and Y/C mix circuits, and automatically switch between S and Composite depending on the presence or absence of the signal.<br><br>By using the dedicated system connector for connection with the AMV 3000, it is also possible to remotely control the power supply of the power amplifier.<br>When the system connector is connected, the AVM-3000 amplifier configuration can be automatically switched with the Complete / Processor switch. Normally, it is Complete. If you use your own amplifier for L/R and AVM-3000 for AVM - for Center or Effect, the L/R output is output to the pin terminal when you switch to the processor side. The L/R output of the system connector changes to the front effect and the front effect changes to the rear effect.<br><br>The Midi in connector is installed.<br><br>It comes with 2 types of remote control, learning remote control and simple remote control.</p>
