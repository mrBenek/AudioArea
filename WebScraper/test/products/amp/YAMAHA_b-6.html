				<p class="detail">This is a stereo power amplifier with a unique pyramidal design.<br><br>The basic configuration consists of an X power supply based on the Phase Angle Control newly developed by Yamaha, and an X amplifier based on a high SVRR (Supply Voltage Rejection Ratio) amplifier and a real-time processor.<br><br>The X power supply with the Phase Angle Control circuit mounted on the B-6 has a TRIAC element, which controls the AC power by controlling the AC conduction phase angle (Phase Angle Control), inserted into the primary side of the transformer. Information obtained by comparing the output DC voltage of the secondary side with the reference voltage is fed back to the gate of the TRIAC to keep the output voltage of the secondary side constant.<br>Specifically, the voltage comparison amplifier detects that the DC output voltage tends to decrease according to the power consumed in the secondary side by comparing it with the reference voltage produced by the reference voltage generation circuit. The signal from the voltage comparison amplifier is fed back to the primary side at high speed through a photocoupler that combines a light emitting diode and a phototransistor. It controls the signal applied to the gate of the TRIAC inserted in the primary side and controls the power input to the transformer.<br>By controlling the waveform of the voltage applied to the primary side of the transformer by the signal from the secondary side, this X power supply can shorten the energization time to 1/2 of the conventional one. It can supply a large amount of power in a compact form and in a well-regulated manner. In addition, it does not switch a large amount of power at a high frequency close to the audible band like a switching regulator, so there is almost no noise.<br><br>The amplifier circuit uses X amplification.<br>The X amplifier uses a real-time wave processor that detects the rising speed and magnitude of the output signal and switches the power voltage in two stages at high speed in response to the request of the detected signal. This enables high power, high quality, and high efficiency.<br><br>The circuit configuration of the main amplifier consists of floating bridge complimentary service push-pull, cascode pure complimentary service pre-drive, and 3-stage emitter-follower pure complimentary service push-pull drive.<br>The first stage employs a high-precision Dual FET and Dual transistor to achieve low drift and high SVRR. In addition to allowing sufficient idle current to flow, the circuit speed is increased by combining it with the pre-drive stage of a cascode-connected pure complimentary service push-pull.<br>The drive output stage is a 3-stage emitter follower with HighfT and transistors. The output stage uses a HighfT transistor molded with copper and plastic in parallel push-pull. The power transistor used in this output stage has an extremely fast switching speed and almost no switching distortion even at 20 kHz. In addition, both NPN and PNP types have good hfe linearity over a wide current range and the crossover distortion is minimized. In addition, since copper is used, there is almost no current distortion when a large current flows.<br><br>The real-time wave processor consists of two comparators, a derivative (dv/dt) detection circuit that monitors the rise time of the output signal, a level detection circuit, and a high-speed (High) fT transistor, so that the power supply voltage can be switched in real time as needed.<br><br>It has a built-in PC limiter circuit that detects the collector loss (Pc) of the power transistor and limits the drive when the speaker is short-circuited or when a load of 4 Ω or less is connected.<br>In addition, we have mounted a speaker protection circuit that uses a relay to disconnect the speaker from the amplifier in the event that DC is input to the input terminal or DC component leaks to the speaker terminal due to trouble. This speaker protection circuit also serves as a muting circuit to prevent shock noise that occurs when the power switch is turned on.<br><br>We use quality parts such as electrolytic capacitors for audio equipment, fast recovery diodes, metal film resistors, and gold-plated input / output terminals.<br><br>The cabinet has a pyramid-shaped design integrally molded with aluminum die cast.</p>
