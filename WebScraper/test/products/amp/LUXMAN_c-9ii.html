				<p class="detail">A control amplifier based on C-9 that achieves an S/N ratio improvement of 10 dB by adopting newly developed custom parts such as ultra-low noise resistors and new circuit constants.<br><br>The C-9II is equipped with a powerful buffer amplifier of a scale comparable to that of a power amplifier, ensuring excellent drivability.<br><br>A fully balanced CSSC circuit is used for the circuit configuration.<br>The CSSC circuit is a single stagger circuit with pure complimentary service configuration directly connected to all stages. The second stage of the amplifier stage is a current transmission stage with a grounded base circuit, so that the that the cut-off frequency is sufficiently high, and the bandwidth of the amplifier is almost secured only by the first stage. This ensures stable operation with the minimum necessary compensation. In addition, in order to increase the signal energy to be sent to the power amplifier, a two stage Darlington grounded complimentary service emitter-follower circuit is adopted for the output stage. This circuit reduces the sending impedance and enhances the musical expression power as a power amplifier driver.<br>In addition, the C-9II has a fully balanced configuration that combines two CSSC circuits to obtain high reproducibility of minute signals.<br><br>It adopts OD β circuit which is a unique NFB method.<br>In general NFB circuits with DC and AC separate feedback, a servo amplifier is used to apply a large amount of NFB in order to control the DC region, which is relatively difficult to control. However, the difference in the method between the middle and low frequencies has created a cause of inconsistency in sound quality.<br>In the C-9II, the DC servo amplifier is eliminated by refining the bare characteristics of the circuit, and the tone color is unified over all bands.<br><br>Ultra-low strain rate, high rigidity structure Ultimate volume is used for the volume.<br>In this volume, the accuracy and sound quality accuracy and sound quality in the sliding continuous variable resistor, high performance of within ± 0.5 dB (0 to -95dB) linking error of both L and R channels and maximum attenuation of -120dB or less is realized.<br><br>STAR Circuit Pattern Technology is used to supply power from the power supply to each circuit. By supplying power to each amplifier stage in an individual route, the reference point of amplification is kept constant and contamination noise is eliminated.<br><br>High-inertia power supply is used for the power supply section.<br>In a general power supply, there is a difference between the actual music signal and the time from feedback of the signal until control is performed, which always acts as a delay control. This time difference appears as a small fluctuation of the power supply voltage and has a significant effect on sound quality.<br>In the high-inertia power supply of LAX, we have newly developed and adopted a large-capacity special capacitor with extremely excellent instantaneous discharge characteristics at the output side of the regulator circuit with sufficiently high regulation at the AC level. By always pooling a spacious power supply inside the amplifier, we solve the problem caused by delay control.<br><br>Large mass FRP chassis base of 5-point grounding is adopted for the chassis part. By mounting each part firmly on this base, the effect of unnecessary vibration is cut off and mechanical noise is eliminated.<br>In addition, the internal structure adopts a high-rigidity box shielding structure with shielding plates divided into sections with different roles. In particular, the power supply section adopts a unique independent power supply room system. The power supply section is housed in an individual unit to block leakage flux, and the entire power supply room is isolated from the main chassis by anti-vibration materials to shut out all noise components from both electromagnetic and functional aspects from the power supply section.<br><br>The noise filter is reinforced to prevent high-frequency noise and interference noise from the power supply, and the reproducibility of music at the minute level is improved.<br><br>The C-9II is fully equipped with a newly developed ultra-low-noise, low-distortion custom resistor with excellent micro-level reproducibility, and realizes a significant S/N ratio improvement of 10 dB without excessive dependence on NFB.<br>In addition, custom parts such as small-capacity capacitors, copper-plated Styrofoam capacitors with copper shields, and sealed gold-plated contact relays are used.<br><br>There are two types of input, unbalanced Route 6 and balanced, two types of output, unbalanced and balanced, and two types of tape input / output. Both unbalanced and balanced can be selected for bi-amp drive.<br><br>The front panel is made of thick pure aluminum material with a special satin finish and champagne gold finish.<br>In addition, a lustrous wooden cabinet is used for the cabinet.</p>
