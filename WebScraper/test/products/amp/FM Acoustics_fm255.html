				<p class="detail">A line-stage preamplifier equipped with a unique input and symmetrical output circuit for complete symmetrical signal processing.<br><br>The FM255 uses a fully discrete-configuration enhanced Class A circuit with unique precision adjustment without the use of an operational amplifier or IC, and achieves an excellent CMRR (common-mode rejection ratio) of 95 dB over the entire playback band.<br><br>The fully balanced super-coupling output has a sensor circuit that automatically compensates for differences between balanced and unbalanced loads, so that all interfaces are 100% compensated and no rewiring or soldering is required to dominate the interface function.<br><br>It uses its own fully balanced and enhanced Class A circuit for high stability and high purity signal processing, without any overall feedback or feed-forward.<br><br>It uses a specially designed bias circuit to reach operating temperature very quickly without the need for long warm-up, and to minimize the change in tone after warm-up.<br><br>The phase of the main output can be inverted by 180 ° with the phase inversion switch on the front panel.<br>This operation is performed without any additional circuitry, and the signal does not enter the 180 ° phase inversion stage ; the positive and negative signal paths are identical.<br><br>A tape monitor circuit using a discrete class A buffer circuit is mounted.<br>The built-in buffer circuit enables constant sound quality and signal transmission regardless of load or source type.<br><br>The built-in high-precision power supply circuit realizes excellent noise characteristics and distortion factor.<br>The internal power supply is fully shielded and an additional supershield is added inside the transformer housing to eliminate hum, noise, magnetic and electronic interference of all kinds and conduct it to ground.<br><br>No internal wiring for signal transmission is used, and variations in performance between units are eliminated.<br><br>All output circuits are protected from short circuit.<br><br>The chassis structure is mechanically damped to protect sensitive electronic components from inductive resonance. The chassis side panels, covers, bottom and transformer mounting are supported by special rubber and Dellin2 suspension.<br>Special shielding prevents hum, interference, and noise entering the audio signal path through relays, switches, and potentiometers.<br><br>The output level control uses precise and high-resolution spread balance control and is carefully isolated by a unique enhanced class A buffer circuit.<br><br>The balance control uses a unique super-wide balance control.<br>This balance control uses a center positioning system that adjusts the knob within ± 1 dB when the knob is rotated from the center position of ± 45 °. This method provides an excellent resolution of 0.02 dB and allows far more accurate adjustment than a conventional balance control.<br><br>It uses a Swiss-made 4-contact ultra-high precision relay with hermetic seal.<br>The four specially coated contacts can withstand tens of millions of switch-over operations, and the hermetic seal keeps the contacts unaffected by the surrounding environment, preventing degradation of overall performance and sound quality.<br><br>The pin arrangement of the balanced input connector is the standard specification of #1 ground, #2 cold and #3 hot, but it can be changed to the configuration of #1 ground, #2 hot and #3 cold by the high-precision switch.<br><br>It has a unique control / protection circuit.<br>Delay type switch-on is adopted. No signal flows to the output when the switch is turned on. The control circuit starts the output after each part is completed by self-diagnosis. It takes about 10 seconds to reach the complete operation state.<br>It also includes sensors to protect the FM255 and connected devices from excessive voltage drops that can cause malfunction, transient failure, or DC instability.<br><br>Equipped with two fully balanced high-level inputs and Route 3 unbalanced high-level inputs, high-precision unbalanced tape monitor loops such as buffers, and fully balanced outputs.<br><br>It is a fully modular design.</p>
