				<p class="detail">A stereo power amplifier equipped with ZDR (Zero Distortion Rule), X power supply, linear transfer circuit, etc.<br><br>The basic circuit configuration of B-70 consists of a class A class push-pull cascode complimentary service amplifier stage, a cascode complimentary service pre-drive stage, and a 3-stage Darlington complimentary service 4 parallel linear transfer circuit equipped with newly developed ZDR.<br>The power supply consists of X power supply and X amplifier.<br><br>We have developed and installed a ZDR consisting of a distortion detection circuit and an input addition circuit in order to completely eliminate the distortion generated at the final stage of the power amplifier.<br>The distortion detection circuit has a perfect bridge configuration and detects only the distortion component. The distortion sensor with this bridge detects the fluctuation of the operating point due to the non-linearity of the transistor and the change of the junction temperature, including the error of the emitter resistance of the power transistor, as well as noise and disturbance from the power supply as the fluctuation of the input / output linearity. In the speaker, the distortion can be detected without being affected by the amplitude and phase of the voltage and current. In addition, the distortion generated by the back electromotive force from the speaker is also detected.<br>In the addition circuit, the voltage of the distortion component is added from the floating power supply to the power stage input part as a floating bridge circuit.<br>Since the series addition method is adopted for the signal source, the drive signal current from the voltage amplifier stage and the distortion correction current are kept independent, and accurate distortion cancellation operation is possible without adversely affecting each other.<br>In this ZDR, the power gain of the power stage can be used as it is because the correction necessary for obtaining a distortion-free output is performed on the input side, and the power required for correction is very small. In addition, since the amplitude of both voltage and current is small, the distortion of the correction system can be ignored. Furthermore, since the output impedance is determined only by the distortion-free linear resistance component, it can be improved by overall NFB from the output terminal.<br><br>The X power supply, which is also used for B-6, is used for the power supply part.<br>In this power supply circuit, when the DC output voltage tends to decrease according to the power consumed in the secondary side, the voltage comparison amplifier compares it with the reference voltage generated by the reference voltage generation circuit and detects it. The signal from the voltage comparison amplifier is fed back to the primary side at high speed through a photocoupler that combines a light emitting diode and a phototransistor, and the signal applied to the gate of the TRIAC inserted in the primary side is controlled to control the power input to the transformer.<br>The TRIAC element operates like a switch that turns ON/OFF in synchronization with the power supply frequency. In the conventional power supply circuit, the entire cycle of the power supply frequency is input to the transformer, while in the X power supply, the phase angle of energization is controlled as necessary and input to the transformer. This reduces the energization time to less than half of the conventional one. Moreover, since the output voltage does not fluctuate due to power consumption or input voltage fluctuations unlike in the normal power supply, the large power transmission equivalent to a huge power supply is possible.<br>As a result of the miniaturization, the impedance of the transformer can be kept low and the sense of volume in the low range is improved. Moreover, unlike switching regulators, which switch high power at high frequencies close to the audible band, there is no noise. Moreover, with conventional power supplies, when the load power increases, the output voltage drops significantly and the input voltage fluctuates directly. but with the X power supply, these fluctuations are kept to a minimum level.<br><br>For the X amplification, we developed and adopted a high SVRR (Supply Voltage Rejection Ratio) amplifier with an advanced circuit structure that is extremely resistant to power supply voltage fluctuations as a basic circuit. We also used a real-time wave processor that detects the rising speed and level of the output signal and switches the power supply voltage in two stages at a high-speed Tr according to the requirements of these two detection signals. This enables us to efficiently obtain high power and high quality.<br><br>Yamaha&#39;s original linear transfer circuit technology is used for the final stage.<br>In this circuit, the bias of each transistor in the parallel configuration is shifted and synthesized so that the transfer characteristic at the time of small signal is close to the square characteristic. By making the transfer characteristic at the time of small signal linear, the occurrence of crossover distortion is eliminated in principle and the bare characteristic is greatly improved.<br><br>It has a built-in PC limiter circuit that detects the collector loss (Pc) of the power transistor and limits the drive when the speaker is shorted or when a load of 4 Ω or less is connected.<br>In addition, there is a built-in speaker protection circuit that uses a relay to disconnect the speaker from the amplifier when DC is input to the input terminal or when DC component leaks into the speaker terminal. This speaker protection circuit also functions as a muting circuit to prevent shock noise when the power switch is turned on.<br><br>Equipped with a large LED20-point peak level meter.<br>This meter is equipped with a peak hold switch, an x0. 1W range switch, and a meter off switch.<br><br>Each speaker A/B has its own level control.<br><br>Equipped with AC outlet.</p>
