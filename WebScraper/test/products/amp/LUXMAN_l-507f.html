				<p class="detail">The pre-main amplifier of the f series was developed by completely reviewing the circuit structure and design of the existing integrated series.<br><br>The power amplifier section is equipped with the ODNF circuit that is also used for M-7f/C-7f.<br>In order to realize this circuit, we first developed and adopted an ultra-wide-band, high-slew rate, low-distortion circuit that does not require phase correction for the amplification circuit of the music signal. Phase correction, which cannot be avoided with conventional negative feedback circuits, is eliminated.<br>We also pay attention to the nature of NFB itself. We pick up only the distortion component from the output and feed it back to the final stage of the amplifier circuit so as to cancel it. This removes only the distortion component from the output waveform. By separating the NFB from the music signal, we have achieved a high initial slew rate and ultra-wide bandwidth that rise instantaneously. In addition, by eliminating the DC servo amplifier for ultra-low frequency control, which had been the cause of unnatural coloring in the low frequency range in the NFB circuit, we have achieved uniform tone quality in all bands.<br><br>The output power of the f series is drastically increased in order to increase the driving force at low impedance load.<br><br>Thorough measures are taken against noise caused by unwanted vibration or interference between circuits.<br>Based on a chassis base excellent in vibration absorption mode, parts are firmly fixed in a thick chassis to realize a housing structure that reduces vibration noise.<br>The layout is such that the power transformer, electrolytic capacitor, and amplifier block do not directly interfere with each other. The BOX structure is adopted in which each block is shielded by a shield plate. The internal filter is reinforced to eliminate mutual interference due to flux and to suppress the influence of external noise.<br><br>It is designed as a separate pre-main type and can be upgraded to a separate system by combining with other power amplifiers and control amplifiers.<br>It can also be expanded to bi-amp or multi-amp systems by adding a power amplifier.<br><br>Uses custom parts exclusively for Luxman.<br>The resistor is based on an acoustically excellent carbon film resistor, and is studied in various fields such as selection of alumina, etching, carbonization, terminal material, terminal shape and press-fit shape. This improves the information transfer fee and enables richer music reproduction.<br>Custom parts are also used for power transformers, block capacitors, electrolytic capacitors, copper bus bars, and high-purity cables.<br><br>Equipped with a large power meter.<br>This meter uses a logarithmic compression display system and is designed to be easy to read while moving. In addition, the thickness of acrylic is 8 mm and attention is paid to the luminescent color and the illumination effect of the brand logo.<br><br>The input terminal is equipped with RCA terminal and balance terminal.<br>The speaker terminal uses an independently developed large speaker terminal that is compatible with banana plugs and Y lugs.<br><br>The exterior has a high quality design with a precision hairline treatment.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.<br><br>For the f-Series, the optimum position is the -14dB position of the main volume so that it can be enjoyed in a multi-channel environment such as home theater.<br>By simply adjusting the volume to this position, it is possible to combine the channels set by the AV processor without losing the volume balance of each channel.</p>
