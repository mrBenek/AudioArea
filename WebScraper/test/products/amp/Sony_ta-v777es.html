				<p class="detail">An AV amplifier equipped with Cinema Studio EX, an advanced form of digital cinema sound.<br><br>Equipped with the Cinema Studio EX mode, you can enjoy a surround sound field of 360 degrees all around.<br>This mode integrates the Cinema Studio Reverbation, which adds the reverberation of the editing theater, the virtual multi-dimensional, which reproduces the virtual multi-rear speaker environment using virtual 3D technology, and the screen depth matching, which realizes the expressive power of depth feeling in the screen direction.<br><br>It is designed to be used not only as an AV amplifier but also as a pre-main amplifier for pure audio. It is equipped with an analog purity control function.<br>The TA-V777ES not only stops the clock but also shuts off the power supply to the digital system to completely eliminate noise generation. The TA-V 4500 es does not only stop the clock but also shuts off the power supply to the digital system.<br>It is also possible to turn off the power of the video amplifier for audio-only inputs that do not use video circuits. For example, if a DVD player image is connected directly from the component outputs to a projector, audio can be used with the power of the video amplifier turned off by using the CD-input. Digital inputs can be used for Dolby Digital and DTS decoding and digital cinema sound processing.<br><br>It supports decoding of Dolby Digital and DTS formats. It is equipped with three DSPs for decoding and sound field processing from decoding of sound formats to calculation of digital cinema sound.<br>Dolby We have newly adopted a 24-bit DSP dedicated to decoding digital and DTS. Since this DSP is dedicated to decoding, there is no waste in the arithmetic circuit and operation noise is extremely reduced. In addition, a hardware arithmetic block is built in to increase the precision of repeatedly used arithmetic. This demonstrates the ability to approach the limit of 24-bit DSP with total arithmetic precision.<br>The TA-V777ES uses two 32-bit DSPs specifically developed by Sony for sound field processing. These DSPs are highly capable of processing sound fields even with a single DSP. In addition, the TA-V 32ES raises the operating clock of these DSPs, allowing more room for the sound field processing of Cinema Studio EX with additional screen depth matching.<br><br>All digital inputs support 96kHz/24-bit, and the D/A converter is capable of converting a 96 kHz signal into an audio waveform at the same rate without downsampling.<br>The D/A converter is a fully independent 6-channel configuration.<br><br>A 2-channel 20-bit A/D converter is installed to perform digital cinema sound processing on the analog input.<br><br>Equipped with a digital input swap function, the coaxial terminal assignment can be changed according to the convenience of the system.<br><br>Digital addition to the standard roll-off roll-off characteristics in addition to the standard roll-off characteristics.<br>The standard roll-off characteristic follows the Theory of digital audio and is rich in information. The slow roll-off characteristic has a gentle attenuation characteristic in the band of 20 kHz or higher, so that the transient response is quiet and the sound is comfortable to the ears.<br><br>Equipped with a headphone theater mode.<br>In this mode, virtual 3D technology is used to eliminate the sense of in-the-head, and additional reverberation is added to improve the sense of spaciousness. This allows dialogue and dialogue to be positioned in front.<br><br>The power amplifier section uses a dynamic five amplifier system in which the same power transistor is used for all five channel amplifiers.<br>The power transistor is a mill wrapper rate dual-chip power transistor. This device consists of two adjacent power transistor chips with the same characteristics on a single copper plate. This device has the same characteristics, the same heat balance, and the current path passes through adjacent locations, so that the generation of distortion associated with synthesis can be minimized.<br><br>The volume part uses 6 connected volumes independent of each channel to suppress the feeling of turbidity caused by interference between signals.<br>In addition, the frames that make up the volume are made of aluminum die-cast, and sound quality is examined up to the screw fastening strength.<br><br>The power transformer is equipped with an EI 111x100 large capacity transformer of the same size as the TA-N9000ES.<br>In addition, the transformer is equipped with an intermediate tap for extracting the required voltage according to each supply circuit. The intermediate tap is extracted by using a pin type for extracting the coil itself to the tap section. This method has the advantages of less uneven winding, higher conversion efficiency, and less vibration of the transformer itself compared with the method of extracting the lead wire by soldering it to the coil.<br><br>The electrolytic capacitor used in the power supply section is a large 50 mm diameter capacitor made of the same high-sound material used in the TA-N9000ES, taking advantage of the know-how acquired in the development of the TA-N9000ES.<br><br>An sf heat sink with a vibration dispersion fin structure is adopted for the heat sink to reduce fin resonance.<br>Each fin of this heat sink has ribs placed in different positions to prevent tuning fork resonance, reduce split vibration, and minimize the amount of color added to the music.<br><br>The FB/SL chassis is a combination of the FB (Frame &amp; Beam) chassis and the SL (Swerve-Less, distortion reduction) structure that adds elements of angle block to the FB (Frame &amp; Beam) chassis. The frame and beam are joined together to ensure high rigidity, while the joints absorb vibration and reinforce the four corners to prevent distortion.<br><br>An eccentric insulator is used for the legs.<br>In this insulator, screw holes are provided at positions where vibrations transmitted from legs cancel each other, reducing the transmission of external vibrations to the chassis.<br><br>The display uses a dual FL tube and expands the display area of the front panel to increase the amount of information that can be displayed at one time. In addition, the OSD (On Screen Display) function is also included in the surround and equalizer settings.<br><br>The sound field shortcut function allows you to store the sound field and equalizer settings as they are, excluding the function (input source) selection. You can store up to five memories.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
