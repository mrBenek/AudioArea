				<p class="detail">This monaural power amplifier has been carefully designed based on the concept of &quot;amplifier for getting drunk with music&quot;.<br><br>Returning to the starting point of the amplifier design of &quot;faithfully amplifying the input signal and reproducing it as the output signal&quot;, we have developed and installed a new super linear circuit that can obtain characteristics without applying NFB. This eliminates TIM distortion from the root and ensures stability in the high-frequency range.<br><br>It is a class A power amplifier that in principle does not generate any distortion such as switching distortion or crossover distortion. It adopts a unique power supply system of M5 which has a dedicated power supply for class A bias.<br>By increasing the efficiency of the power supply, there is no excessive heat generation, which is considered a drawback of A class amplifier.<br><br>All parts and construction are thoroughly examined, and the best parts are developed and carefully selected using the technology that we have.<br><br>The power transformer is designed to achieve low leakage flux and stable regulation.<br>First, we have adopted a polyester-coated oxygen-free copper wire for the winding, which has a cross-sectional area twice that of ordinary wire. This improves the regulation and reduces the temperature rise of the winding to 1/2. In addition, we have achieved a dramatic improvement in S/N by adopting the toroidal method, which is effective in reducing leakage flux.<br>A non-conductive and non-magnetic resin is used for the transformer case, and silicon carbide powder, which is a radio wave absorber, is mixed into the filler to reduce strain, and the transformer body is floated from the chassis by rubber to reduce vibration.<br><br>A newly developed film capacitor for pure audio has been adopted in order to prevent chattering and squeal in the mid - and high-frequency range caused by the structure of the film capacitor. The film material is a composite structure of polycarbonate with low tan δ (dielectric loss) and polypropylene with high insulation and excellent high-frequency characteristics. This film is wound tightly at low speed and high tension to eliminate wrinkles and stress. In addition, a special winding core and heat-shrinkable resin are utilized to prevent squeal. In addition, in order to prevent the influence of external electric field, double shielding is applied by conductive resin case and conductive resin tube.<br><br>It uses a 4-core power cord for audio that was developed after thorough examination of the power cord.<br>This power cord uses high-conductivity oxygen-free copper wires to reduce losses in the wires, greatly reducing non-linear distortion, and reducing the mutual interference between the two power transformers to reduce the source impedance.<br>In addition, polyethylene with low dielectric constant is used as an insulator to reduce loss and prevent conductor vibration.<br><br>In order to stably supply high power of 300W to the speakers, a large output terminal is newly installed.<br>The cable connection opening is wide (3.8x14mm) to allow for the connection of very thick speaker cables. The cable connection method is a vise type in which the cord is crimped by two flat plates with internal knurling.<br>The contact surface is gold-plated to improve stability and reliability.<br><br>The fuse used is an audio fuse that was developed after reconsidering the material.<br>By changing the cap material from conventional brass to pure copper, the conductor resistance is reduced to approximately 1/3. In addition, by changing from alloy to pure metal, the non-linearity between dissimilar metals generated inside the alloy is improved.<br>Furthermore, nickel plating, which is a ferromagnetic material, is replaced with tin plating, which is a non-magnetic material, thereby eliminating magnetic strain.<br><br>A glass epoxy substrate developed for audio equipment is used for the substrate. By using 99.99% pure oxygen-free copper, non-linearity is dramatically improved. By changing the conventional 35 μ m copper to 280 μ m thick copper, the conductor resistance is reduced to 1/8, enabling stable signal transmission.<br>By using a glass epoxy board with excellent moisture resistance, the change in capacitance inside the copper foil is minimized and leakage inside the circuit is prevented.</p>
