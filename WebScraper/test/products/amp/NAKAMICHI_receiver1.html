				<p class="detail">A receiver equipped with a unique harmonic time alignment amplifier.<br><br>The amplifier section is designed using Nakamichi&#39;s original harmonic time alignment theory.<br>The Harmonic Time Alignment Theory was proposed by Steve Kalison, a former researcher at the Nakamichi America Research Center. The theory states that &quot;sound is good when the music signal and its harmonic distortion are aligned in time.&quot; This is related to the phenomenon that an amplifier with more distortion sometimes produces better sound than an amplifier with less distortion.<br>The amplifier circuit used in the Receiver1 was developed based on this theory. It uses a wide-band, low-gain open loop design to keep the amount of NFB in the audio band constant. In addition, the amount of NFB itself is suppressed slightly, and a method to adjust the fundamental sound and distortion components correctly in time is applied.<br>In addition, it is equipped with a power amplifier with excellent current supply capability to support low-impedance speakers.<br><br>The power supply section employs a multi-regulated power supply system that independently regulates each stage of the amplifier, tuner section, display circuit, and logic circuit to prevent interference between sections.<br>The ground circuit also uses a unique isolated ground system to shut out interference noise around the ground line.<br><br>The tone control circuit uses a circuit that can adjust both ends of the frequency band without changing the characteristics of the middle band.<br>This circuit can be lost.<br><br>A quartz-lock synthesizer is used for the tuner section.<br>This circuit uses a multiplex stage with a precision ceramic oscillator to ensure high selectivity, and an RF amplifier with a low-noise dual-gate MOS FET to provide high sensitivity and excellent reception performance that is robust against overloads.<br>In addition, an isolation buffer is provided at the tuner output stage to prevent adverse effects of high-frequency noise on the audio signal.<br><br>FM/AM10-station preset memories are installed.<br><br>A motor-driven volume is used to prevent the deterioration of sound quality that occurs with electronic volume, while enabling volume adjustment by remote control.<br><br>The Receiver1 has a video input / output connector in addition to an audio input / output connector.<br>It also has a separate output selector for playback and recording.<br><br>Equipped with a wide-band video buffer amplifier.<br><br>Equipped with variable loudness control.<br><br>Built-in pre-out / main in terminal.<br><br>Equipped with high-speed protection circuit.<br><br>It comes with a system remote control that allows you to operate the connected Nakamichi component as well as the receiver.<br><br>By using the optional remote sensor RS-7, remote control is possible from a room other than the room in which the system is placed.<br>Up to three RS-7 units can be connected, and the same remote controller as the included wireless remote controller is sold separately and can be added for use in a separate room.<br>In addition, it is equipped with a remote selection function of speaker A/B so that you can select two pairs of speakers to sound.</p>
