				<p class="detail">A stereo power amplifier designed to take full advantage of the advantages of a vertical power FET with a powerful power supply.<br><br>3.6 mm cross-sectional area for the secondary winding in the power supply section<sup>2</sup>A large toroidal transformer using a flat copper wire is adopted.<br>Coupled with the high-performance Orient Core (Nippon Steel Z-8H), it has obtained excellent regulation superior to the conventional toroidal transformer. The voltage drop at full load continuous 450 VA is less than 3% and the temperature rise is less than 28 ℃.<br>The condenser is equipped with 22,000 μ Fx2. The new electrode structure and improved electrolysis station have reduced the output loss. Moreover, the deviation of the capacitance between two pairs is less than 5%. This almost completely eliminates the unevenness of the capacitance caused by the output waveform due to the variation of the capacitance, which has not been a problem so far.<br><br>In the first stage of the amplifier section, a compound FET with good thermal stability, in which three elements including those for constant current are enclosed in one chip, is adopted. A DC amplifier configuration with no NFB loop and no low-frequency time constant up to the output stage is adopted.<br>The shift of the operating point and mid-point drift due to the fluctuation of the power supply voltage, which tend to occur with DC conversion, are dealt with by using a constant current power supply for the first and second stage differential amplifier sections, and a capacitor is used for the input section to prevent DC shock.<br><br>The output stage is a pure complimentary service parallel push-pull circuit in which two high-voltage vertical power FETs of P-channel and N-channel are carefully selected and combined.<br>The vertical power FET has excellent characteristics such as 3-pole tube characteristics and excellent switching characteristics at ultra-high frequencies. However, since the input impedance lowers at high frequencies, the JM-S7 uses a complimentary service transistor in the drive stage to allow sufficient current to flow and drive without distortion.<br>An idle current of approximately 400 mA is applied to the power FET for class AB operation, and clear sound quality of class A operation is obtained at low volume, and good sound quality of elongation is obtained at high volume.<br><br>Since the power FET is a 3-pole tube, the bias current changes according to the fluctuation of the power supply voltage.<br>To cope with this problem, the JM-S7 is equipped with an automatic control circuit to maintain the proper bias.<br><br>A large aluminum die-cast heat sink is adopted, and temperature rise at maximum output is suppressed to 30 ℃ or less.<br><br>When the temperature of the heat sink exceeds 85 ℃ due to a short-circuit load, it is equipped with a 3 Oshige point protection circuit that disconnects the load and simultaneously controls the current of the output stage. It also protects the speaker from pop noise and fluctuation of the midpoint potential when the power is turned on / off.<br><br>Equipped with 2 types of speaker selector and headphone port.<br><br>The side panel is removable.</p>
