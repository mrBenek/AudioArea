				<p class="detail">This is an AV amplifier with THX ULTRA certified quality and a 7 ch power amplifier compatible with THX SURROUND EX.<br><br>With a fully discrete 7-channel power amplifier, it delivers 150Wx2 for 2-channel playback and 150W for each 7-channel multi-channel.<br>An independent direct power supply is used in the power supply section to support these devices. The power supply section is divided into three blocks : the Lch section, the Rch section, and the center ch section to reduce crosstalk between channels through the rectifying circuit.<br><br>In addition to decoding Dolby Digital, DTS and MPEG2-AAC, and adjusting sound quality with parametric equalizers, as well as sound field processing for THX Surround EX and multi-channel DAP, it is equipped with two DSPs 56367 which are 24 bitDSP (Digital Signal Processor) made by Motorola with 150 MIPS calculation processing power.<br>This enables digital processing with 96 kHz sampling.<br>In addition, a 96 kHz / 24-bit A/D converter is installed in consideration of sound quality when various DSP processes are performed on analog input signals.<br><br>It is equipped with THX Surround EX decoder which added 7.1 ch by adding 2 ch (surround back) to 5.1 ch.<br>You can enjoy not only surround EX-compatible sources but also ordinary 5.1 ch sources by expanding to 7.1 ch.<br><br>It is equipped with DAP (Digital Acoustic Processor) that reproduces various hall sound fields by digital processing based on measured data.<br>A computer-based sound field simulation technology developed jointly by Tokyu Kensetsu Co., Ltd. and Victor Company of Japan, Ltd., which designed and constructed buildings such as the Bunkamura Shibuya Orchard Hall and the Yokohama Sunheart Hall, and the Sound Research Institute of Victor Company of Japan, Ltd., has been introduced to enhance the perfection of the sound field. This technology enables the extraction of various sound field patterns, which was difficult to obtain by measuring reflected sound by conventional impulse response. Moreover, this technology has been verified by human audition, making it possible to obtain natural sound fields.<br>As a result, in addition to 2-channel surround movies, audio from monaural film movies, music sources recorded with linear PCM, and 5.1 channel sources for Dolby Digital, DTS, and MPEG2-AAC recording are all expanded to 7.1 channel sound field data.<br><br>New K2 technology with compression mode (real algorithm) to improve sound quality variation due to compressed digital signal, and CC converter equipped with this is installed in all 7.1 channels.<br><br>All 7.1 channels are equipped with a PEM-DD converter with low harmonic noise and good sound quality.<br><br>Equipped with a precision downmix converter.<br>This is an analog downmix technology for DVD-Multi and EXT7.1 ch analog multi-channel inputs. It is possible to set up speakers according to the room or base material without losing sound quality even with DVD-Audio software such as 96kHz/24bit/5ch or multi-channel sources for which speaker management is not allowed.<br><br>Uses a highly rigid cross-frame Z (0) chassis to reduce adverse effects such as unwanted vibration and interference.<br>In addition, in order to realize a layout that does not interfere with each other inside, each circuit is divided into nine blocks for each function, and through thorough subdivision, intrusion of digital noise is eliminated to ensure the purity of audio circuits.<br>In the power supply section, analog and digital transformers are separated, and in order to satisfy the strict quality standard of THX ULTRA, the rectifier circuit and the subsequent circuit are made into independent 7 ch construction. Power is supplied independently and each circuit can be placed close to each other.<br>This reduces transmission loss as much as possible.<br><br>It is equipped with a multi-brand remote control that can operate all AV equipment of major manufacturers and has a learning function that can improve usability by storing frequently used functions.</p>
