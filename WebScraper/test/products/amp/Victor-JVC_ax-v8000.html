				<p class="detail">This is an AV amplifier certified by THX Ultra2, combining JVC&#39;s amplifier technology.<br><br>THX Ultra2, a standard for home theaters, is certified.<br>The Home THX is designed to be able to faithfully reproduce the sound environment of THX in the home, which is the proof of the qualities required by THX for first class movie theaters, and the THX Ultra2 is a new standard that is compatible with the latest surround format and requires further quality improvement.<br>The AX-V8000 combines JVC&#39;s amplifier technology and is certified as a strict standard without being unnecessarily large.<br><br>The power amplifier section is equipped with a seven channel discrete power amplifier.<br>The discrete configuration and independent power supply improve the quality of the power supply to realize high power with low distortion factor.<br>In the case of 5.1 channel playback, it is equipped with a speaker management function that allows bi-amplifier connection, so that the main speaker can be driven with higher quality.<br><br>An independent power supply is used for the power supply section.<br>In this system, the analog audio, digital and video transformers are independent, and the power supply section, which consists of a high-current rectifying circuit and a high-capacity capacitor, is divided into three blocks : the Lch section, the Rch section, and the center ch section. This reduces crosstalk between channels through the rectifying circuit.<br><br>The chassis structure is reinforced with a highly rigid cross-frame Z (0) chassis and stay brackets to prevent unwanted vibration and interference.<br>In addition, along with the adoption of a copper-tight chassis and a four layer board, each circuit is divided into nine blocks for each function, improving S/N, reducing digital noise, and completely eliminating interference within the chassis.<br><br>A ZIST (7.1 interference audio signal transmission) circuit is mounted on the EXT0 ch input.<br>This circuit keeps the cold side of the audio signal independent of ground, preventing the video signal from mixing into the audio signal and reducing sound quality.<br><br>Equipped with a precision downmix converter that enables analog speaker management without loss of sound quality.<br>High-quality multi-channel sources can record ultra-high sound quality on the center channel as well as on the main channel. However, if you want to play music on a system with a center speaker that is clearly inferior to the main speaker, you may want to disable the center speaker. This can be done by changing the speaker settings, but with the DVD player speaker settings, you must reduce the level before adding to avoid overflow when adding in the digital domain, which can adversely affect sound quality.<br>The Precision Downmix Converter is an analog downmix technology for DVD-Multi and EXT7.1 channel analog multi-channel inputs. It can be adjusted to suit the room and equipment without loss of sound quality even with DVD-Audio software such as 96kHz/24bit/5ch or sources for which speaker management is not allowed.<br><br>The circuit that performs digital processing such as surround system decoding and sound field processing is equipped with TI&#39;s 32/64bitDSP &quot;Aureus&quot; with 1800 MIPS for fixed-point operation and 1350 MFLOPS for floating-point operation.<br><br>It supports decoding of Dolby Digital EX, Dolby Pro Logic II, DTS-ES discrete / matrix, DTS NEO : 6, DTS 96/24, etc.<br>It also supports MPEG-2 AAC, etc.<br><br>It is equipped with a high-definition multi-channel DAP (Digital Acoustic Processor) for 7.1 channels, which introduced sound field simulation technology for actual music halls.<br>This system was jointly developed by Tokyu Construction Co., Ltd. and Victor Acoustics Research Laboratories, which were engaged in the acoustic design and construction of the Tokyu Bunkamura Shibuya Orchard Hall and other buildings. The introduction of computer-based sound field simulation technology has made it possible to extract sound field patterns, which were difficult to detect by measuring reflected sound with conventional impulse responses. Furthermore, this system has been verified by human ears, making it possible to reproduce real hall sound fields.<br>With this function, it is possible to extend surround of various formats to all 7.1 channel sound field data.<br><br>Equipped with a CC converter to improve the sound quality of digital signals.<br>The CC converter in the AX-V8000 is based on K2 technology with a compression mode (real algorithm) to improve the compressed digital signal in addition to the ExtendedK2 processing in the high-end CD-player.<br>This CC converter is mounted on the 7.1 ch, and the reproducibility is further enhanced by high bit and high sampling.<br><br>The D/A converter uses a 192 kHz / 24-bit PEM-DD converter developed by Victor for DVD audio.<br>All 7.1 channels of the AX-V8000 are equipped with this noise-shaping type D/A converter chip originally developed by VICTOR/JVC.<br><br>Equipped with an A/D converter for analog multi-channel input.<br>Compatible with 5.1 channel analog sources such as DVDs, the front 2 channel can be converted to 192kHz/24bit, while other channels can be converted to 96kHz/24bit. This allows high-precision digital conversion of analog multi-channel input, enabling all digital processing.<br><br>Equipped with a video converter, it is possible to convert between composite video signal and S video signal (Y/C separation and mixing).<br>Since the composite image input and S image input can be converted into component signals and output, there is no need to switch the input on the display side.<br><br>Although it is a large amplifier, it is designed to be quiet by not using a cooling fan at all.<br><br>Equipped with an on-screen display function, you can superimpose on the video screen.<br><br>Equipped with an audio delay function, it can compensate for subtle differences between video and audio.<br><br>Route 3 equipped with D5 image input of the highest standard D-terminal and D5-compatible component image input.<br><br>It is equipped with a phono equalizer that supports both MM and MC.<br><br>The speaker terminal uses a brass machined gold plated terminal.<br><br>Equipped with 3D headphone mode, you can enjoy stereoscopic sound even with headphones.<br><br>RM-A2500X, an AV system controller with a large touch panel LCD equipped with macro and learning functions, is included as a wireless remote control.<br>The included RM-A2500X is specifically designed for the AX-V8000.</p>
