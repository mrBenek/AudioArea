				<p class="detail">A pre-main amplifier developed as a successor to the PMA 2000 IV.<br><br>The model name AE means Advanced Evolution, and it is positioned as a product that is related to SA series.<br><br>The output stage uses a single push-pull circuit using UHC (Ultra High Current) -MOS.<br>With the smallest amplifier element, it has a current supply capability 3 to 10 times that of the normal one, and it realizes both fine expressive power and high power.<br><br>The power supply section is composed of a power supply circuit for the preamplifier that requires a stable voltage and a power supply circuit for the output stage that requires a large current, which are independent from the winding section of the power transformer. This configuration eliminates the effect of the operating current of the output stage and improves the resolution of the preamplifier section that handles small signals.<br>A high-current Schottky barrier diode is used for rectification to support the expressive power of UHC-MOS with low-noise characteristics and high-speed operation, and a large-capacity block electrolytic capacitor for audio is used for power supply to provide a stable and clean power supply.<br><br>The electrical and magnetic characteristics of the power transformer are greatly improved by connecting two transformers in parallel.<br>In addition, by using the L. C. (Leakage Canceling) mounting method which cancels the influence of each other&#39;s magnetism to each other, the leakage flux which is a source of noise in the amplifier is also reduced.<br>In addition, the transformer is mounted with a special resin or anti-vibration material to enhance the floating effect and eliminate adverse effects on sound quality.<br><br>It has a power amp direct terminal that can be connected directly to the power amp from another preamp, and a pre-out terminal that can be connected to another power amp or a subwoofer.<br>The Power Amp Direct function can be switched ON/OFF with a switch on the front panel, and the pre-out terminal is output from a MOS-FET discrete configuration flat amplifier, giving consideration to sound quality.<br><br>By reviewing each of the volume circuit, tone circuit and power amplifier circuit, the upper limit of the frequency in actual use is secured to 100 kHz.<br><br>Using the Precision Signal Ground circuit, the noise flowing into the ground circuit, which is the reference of signal amplification, is reduced to stabilize the ground potential.<br><br>In order to thoroughly suppress the effect of vibration on sound quality, the Precision Mechanical Ground structure is adopted, which is a review of the vibration isolation structure. In mounting and positioning various parts, measures are taken to effectively eliminate the effect of external and internal vibration, and transparency and sound image localization are improved.<br>The power transformer, which is the source of vibration, is mounted floating using multiple damping materials, and the radiator is dumped by elastic material and radiator stabilizer and directly attached near the leg part to prevent interference with other vibration sources such as the power transformer.<br><br>The internal layout is a twin monaural configuration in which power amplifier blocks are arranged in L/R symmetry, and interference of each circuit and inflow of noise are suppressed.<br>In addition, circuits with different signal levels are separated for complete shielding, and a 6-block separated structure using 1.6 mm thick black-treated steel plate eliminates the influence of interference between each block on sound quality.<br><br>The equalizer amplifier has a discrete configuration using a low-noise FET for the first stage circuit.<br>The power supply is also dedicated to the phono equalizer for stabilization.<br>It is compatible with both MM and MC cartridges by switching the back panel switch.<br><br>OFC wires are used at important points of internal wiring materials.<br>For film capacitors, electrolytic capacitors, resistors, and inductors, we have adopted high-quality parts that have been examined and listened to through the development of PMA-SA1 and PMA-SA11.<br><br>Machined gold plated pin jack is used for Phono and CD input.</p>
