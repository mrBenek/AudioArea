				<p class="detail">This is an AV amplifier that uses the audio technology cultivated so far and pursues high sound quality without relying on visual sense.<br><br>Sound quality is an important issue, and five power amplifiers are configured discretely.<br>We have succeeded in increasing the surround effect further by distributing the front and rear to the ideal power balance.<br>The front L/R, center 100Wx3ch, rear 50Wx2ch 5-amp system with the same power and quality. It is equipped with a Dolby Prologic Surround Processor, which has the same functions as professional decoders, enabling sound field reproduction.<br><br>The power supply is an A/V independent power supply to eliminate interference between audio and visual signals with different characteristics, and a newly designed transformer and large heat sink are adopted.<br>We have also improved the quality of our power supply by taking into consideration each part, such as capacitors for audio, high-speed diodes, and copper screws effective in vibration absorption.<br><br>The Bass, Treble and Mid Tone Control allows you to adjust bass, treble and mid independently.<br><br>In order to cope with software whose channel balance is out of balance depending on the scene, it is equipped with an auto input balance which always performs stable decoding automatically.<br><br>It is equipped with the latest floating digital delay in order to create sound field space such as concert hall, and it is also possible to create surround space for 2 ch software as well as prologic software.<br>The delay time can be controlled up to 100 msec in steps of 5/10msec. For example, when playing back in &quot;Stadium Mode&quot;, by setting the delay time optimally, it is possible to play back the sound field space as if you were present in the scene.<br><br>Equipped with 4-mode surround sound which enables sound field reproduction by Dolby Prologic.<br>In normal mode, when a small speaker is used in the center, a signal of 100 Hz or less is sent to the front L/R to reproduce low sound.<br>The Wide mode is a surround mode that produces the pro-logic volume when the center uses speakers of the same quality as the front L/R.<br>Phantom mode is a mode in which playback is performed by four speakers in the front and rear, and the center signal is equally distributed to the front L and R.<br>Dolby 3 stereo mode does not use the rear speaker. In the case of front 3 ch, the rear signal is mixed to the front L/R to obtain an effect similar to surround sound.<br><br>In addition to the ProLogic, there is also a surround mode, which uses a floating digital delay to control eight channels and six lines simultaneously. This enables a 2-channel stereo source to create a wide and rich sound field.<br>In matrix mode, the front outputs 2 channels as they are, and the rear outputs reverberation.<br>Hall mode is characterized by the depth of rich reverberation with a concert hall setting and the sound field with a sense of spaciousness.<br>Stadium mode recreates the scale and enveloping sound of large live concerts and sports events.<br>The Natural mode creates a natural sound field in contrast to a rich source of reverberation.<br><br>It is equipped with a total of 10 input systems of video Line 5 and audio Line 5 corresponding to the S terminal.<br><br>Equipped with an A/V parallel dubbing function that enables tape dubbing of CDs while video is being dubbed.<br>It is also equipped with an AV mix recording and playback function that can combine video and audio from different sources.<br><br>Equipped with an auto mode test tone circuit for easy adjustment.<br>This is a function that automatically cycles around each channel and adjusts it. In addition, it is equipped with the manual mode that is also used in commercial equipment. By temporarily fixing the test tone of any selected channel, the output level and tone can be adjusted accurately.<br><br>Comes standard with a programmable remote controller (RS 1260) that allows easy operation from power ON/OFF to function selection, volume adjustment, surround mode setting, etc.</p>
