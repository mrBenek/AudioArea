				<p class="detail">Pre-main amplifier equipped with newly developed Hyper α -X balance circuit.<br><br>In order to eliminate distortion caused by element asymmetry, we have developed and adopted a Hyper α -X balanced circuit based on our original X balanced amplifier technology.<br>In addition to the conventional balance circuit, this circuit has newly introduced a high CMRR type constant current circuit at the first stage of the power amplifier and pre-amplifier, which determine the dynamic characteristics of the amplifier. This circuit achieves a theoretical CMRR improvement of 140 dB. This reduces current variations due to DC offset caused by element asymmetry and reduces dynamic noise generated in the circuit.<br>In addition, all stages are balanced so that music signals can be transmitted and amplified simultaneously, and the amplification circuit and ground circuit are completely separated to eliminate adverse effects caused by back electromotive currents and external noise from speakers.<br>In addition, dedicated amplifiers are placed on the + side and - side of the output respectively, and a push-pull system is adopted in which a total of four amplifiers drive the speakers under the same conditions.<br><br>The power stage is equipped with an audio-only device, NM-LAPT, which has excellent high-frequency characteristics and current limit value.<br><br>DC amplifier configuration is used for all stages from input to output.<br>In addition, the performance of the DC amplifier is improved by adopting the NEW diamond differential circuit which can take out the output of the - side without phase inversion, and by improving the response to the instantaneous signal and suppressing the generation of TIM distortion.<br>In addition, in order to make the circuit wide range and high speed, the first stage FET is cascade-connected to eliminate the sound quality degradation that occurs when connecting to external devices with different impedances.<br><br>In order to prevent unbalanced power supply, a closed loop configuration is adopted in which the power supply is separated from the ground. The power stage and voltage amplification stage are completely separated. This provides a stable large current and protects the signal from the natural vibration of the power supply and noise generated during charge and discharge.<br>In addition, leakage flux is minimized, and newly developed parts such as a large power transformer with a total weight of 13 kg and an elliptic electrolytic capacitor are used in a four layered shield case with high-density filler.<br><br>Reinforced twin monaural construction is used to prevent vibration from the power and signal systems.<br>First, large transformers and electrolytic capacitors are installed in the center, and the power unit, which consists of power transistors, radiators and other signal systems, is placed symmetrically to ensure an optimal weight balance.<br>We have also introduced a unique technology called Integrated Mechanical Feedback. We use pure copper isolation parts between the master volume and the chassis, between the power transistor and the radiator, and at the mounting base of the electrolytic capacitor. Taking advantage of the high internal loss and excellent vibration absorption capability, we cut off the transmission path of vibration.<br>In addition, in order to isolate the space between the insulator and the bottom plate and between the bonnet and the chassis, Teflon tape and Teflon sheet with extremely stable molecular structure are used to suppress sound quality degradation due to vibration and resonance.<br><br>Top quality parts for high sound reproduction, newly developed pure copper oval insulator, hood with paint containing copper powder, copper-plated rear panel, volume knob with solid aluminum machined out, etc. are designed to reduce vibration, impedance, and non-magnetic material in every detail.<br><br>The signal transmission circuit is simplified to minimize degradation of sound quality, and tone control is eliminated.<br>It is also equipped with a power amp direct input that can directly input the digital source music signal to the power amp section, and a balance input terminal.<br><br>A 6-row detent volume is used.<br><br>It is equipped with source power direct, REC selector and AC outlet.</p>
