				<p class="detail">This digital control amplifier with a built-in digital dividing network was announced as a next-generation reference control amplifier capable of reproducing the high sound quality of DVD audio without exaggeration.<br><br>All six channels are equipped with 192 kHz / 24-bit D/A converters. The front two channels are equipped with eight D/A converters, one for each of the high and low frequencies for the output of the channel dividing network. These converters enable highly accurate D/A conversion for high sampling.<br>We are also working to improve the quality of D/A converters, 192 khz / 24-bit digital filters, DSPs, and A/D converters.<br><br>By making the analog audio output board independent of L and R and completely eliminating interference between left and right signals, transmission errors of L and R channels are minimized as much as possible.<br><br>Equipped with a flexible A/D-D/A system, eight D/A converters are operated with the highest priority on sound quality achieve higher sound quality.<br>Four in parallel for two channel output, two in parallel for low and high frequencies for two channel digital dividing network output, and one in front L and R high and low frequencies for front two channel digital dividing network output (six channels including center, rear, and subwoofer). The remaining four channels are distributed to each channel.<br>In addition, the A/D converter for 6 channels for analog input is parallelized by 3 channels for L and 3 channels for R respectively at the time of normal 2-channel input, thereby improving sound quality and SN ratio.<br><br>A 96 kHz / 24-bit A/D converter is used for all 6-channel analog inputs. Analog source is digitally converted and controlled by A/D conversion.<br>For 2-channel signals, the A/D-converted signal can be output from the digital output terminal by selecting either 96 kHz / 24-bit or down-converted to 48 kHz / 24-bit by DSP.<br><br>Equipped with digital tone control function by newly developed 192kHz/24bitDSP.<br>You can control each of the front, center, and rear channels in three bands : high, middle, and low.<br><br>The volume is a Digital Accurate Control (DAC) volume.<br>The ultra-precision resistance element inside the D/A converter IC is used as a resistance element for volume adjustment, making it possible to operate the ultra-precision resistance element without changing the analog volume sense.<br>As a result, we have obtained many advantages, such as extremely small attenuation error between each channel, less susceptible to vibration, and being able to arrange at an ideal position on the substrate.<br><br>Equipped with a digital phono equalizer for analog record reproduction.<br>With the newly developed 192 kHz / 24-bit high-speed DSP, the digital phono equalizer (RIAA) operates when the three analog inputs are switched from the line input to the phono input.<br><br>Equipped with digital noise reduction (DNR), the newly developed 192kHz/24bitDSP greatly reduces the noise contained in the input audio signal without damaging the audio signal.<br>There are three types of DNR capable of amplifying frequencies up to 96 kHz : digital input, analog input, and FM stereo.<br><br>Includes Legato Link Conversion and Hi-Bit.<br>The newly developed 192kHz/24bitDSP Legato link conversions support digital input at 32 kHz, 44.1 kHz, 48 kHz, 88.2 kHz and 96 kHz. Signals in frequencies that are not recorded in the format are estimated with 1/f attenuation characteristics based on recorded signals, and natural waveforms are reproduced.<br>Hi-Bit requantizes 16-bit digital input data into 24-bit data, enabling expansion of dynamic r-screws.<br>Both functions can be turned on/off.<br><br>It is the first control amplifier equipped with a digital dividing network and realizes frequency band division with high-precision arithmetic processing of up to 192kHz/48bit.<br>Two types of band-splitting filters are installed : an IIR filter that can freely vary the crossover frequency and attenuation characteristics, and an FIR filter that eliminates phase changes that have been unavoidable in the past. These filters maximize the performance of the speaker system with high-precision level adjustment and a time-alignment function that can adjust the time axis between high and low frequencies.<br><br>Equipped with digital time alignment function.<br>It can be used with either IIR or FIR digital filters to adjust the time alignment which is important for multi-way speaker systems.<br><br>A total of 24 sound fields (16 tone controls and 8 speaker configurations) can be set, stored and recalled depending on the item or music genre.<br>You can also name them as you like.<br><br>The signal path is thoroughly simplified, and separation and minimization of the signal path are adopted for a rational configuration.<br>In addition, digital and analog signals are separated to minimize and simplify the signal path.<br><br>One super-ring toroidal transformer is used for both digital and analog systems.<br>Two super-ring toroidal transformers with low loss and low leakage flux, which is a source of noise in the amplifier, are completely separated. Furthermore, the transformer is contained in a case to eliminate the influence of noise from the digital system to the analog system.<br><br>After careful consideration of each element, sound quality is examined through set-mounting, and it is carefully selected from those with excellent high-frequency characteristics.<br><br>In order to reproduce the high sound quality of DVD audio, attention is paid to the mutual electrical influence inside the amplifier, and each part is separated by copper plated steel plate in the 3BOX-5CHAMBER structure.<br><br>The chassis, rear panel, shield case, etc. use high conductivity chassis made of copper plated steel plate to suppress high frequency noise.<br>This reduces the potential difference in the chassis and improves electrical stability.<br><br>A four layer metal plate with excellent rigidity is fixed to the chassis base and made into a penta-layered (five layer structure) to form a stable underbase. Two additional layers of transformer stabilizer made of thick copper-plated steel plate are added to the mounting part of the transformer. In addition, two layers of frame are installed in the front-back direction of the amplifier to secure the chassis strength that is not affected by the sound pressure from the speakers.<br>In addition, brass with excellent damping characteristics is used for the insulator that contacts the outside, eliminating unnecessary vibrations from inside and outside.<br>In addition, it uses a volume knob machined from solid aluminum.<br><br>The Pioneer Digital Interface (PDIF) is an original Pioneer standard for digital transmission until just before D/A conversion to prevent deterioration of the digital source.<br><br>Multi-control remote controller is included.</p>
