				<p class="detail">This ES series AV amplifier is compatible with Virtual Matrix 6.1 mode and Digital Concert Hall mode.<br><br>It is equipped with the Virtual Matrix 6.1 mode corresponding to the 6.1 a new surround system standard for movie theaters.<br>In this mode, the rear channel, which used to be two channels, is divided into three channels : left, center, and right to clarify the sound localization of the rear part.<br>Virtual Matrix 6.1 mode includes Cinema Studio Reverbation (B), Virtual Multi-Dimensional and Screen Depth Matching, which are included in Cinema Studio EX mode. In addition, the rear center speaker is implemented as a virtual speaker for the case where the surround environment is already available in 5.1 channel.<br><br>It is equipped with a digital concert hall mode to enjoy 2-channel stereo sources such as CDs as a concert hall.<br>In the Digital Concert Hall mode, DSP technology is used to create the reverberation that is not included in the software, and it reproduces the impact of a live concert in which the stage and the audience come together.<br>In the Digital Concert Hall Mode, the acoustic characteristics of the Comcell トヘボウ Hall in Amsterdam and the Musique Feline Saar in Viennea are carefully measured and incorporated into the DSP, and the reverberation sound falling on the audience seats is reproduced by virtual speakers using virtual 3D technology.<br>The A mode reproduces the Consell トヘボウ Hall, and you can enjoy the sound field feeling that the initial reflection sound is rich, the stage is very large, and the height of the hall is high. The B mode reproduces the Muzik Feline Saar, and you can enjoy the rich reverberation without the initial reflection sound being conspicuous. In either mode, you can select the amount of reverberation to be generated, with the Standard at the center and three positions of dry (low reverberation) and wet (high reverberation), and the amount of reverberation can be adjusted.<br><br>Equipped with Cinema Studio EX mode.<br>This mode integrates cinematic studio reverberation, virtual (semi) multi-dimensional mode, and screen depth matching. You can choose from three modes, A/B/C, depending on the characteristics of the mixing studio that actually measured the reverberation in Hollywood.<br><br>Three DSPs are installed in the audio format decoding and sound field processing section.<br>Dolby Digital and DTS are decoded using a dedicated 24-bit decode DSP, and digital cinema sound is calculated using two 32-bit DSPs developed by Sony for sound field processing.<br><br>It is equipped with a fully independent 6-channel D/A converter and a 2-channel A/D converter for digital cinema sound processing of analog input.<br>The A/D converter has a 20-bit resolution and the D/A converter supports 96kHz/24b-bit for all channels.<br><br>A dynamic 5-amp system is used for the amplifier section, and the same power transistor is used for each channel amplifier. This transistor has a built-in temperature compensation circuit, and stable operation is possible even when the transistor is cooled immediately after the power is turned on or when it is heated for a while.<br><br>Equipped with an analog direct function.<br>If this function is turned ON, the power supply of the video and digital circuits can be stopped depending on the situation, reducing the noise harmful to enjoying the analog source.<br><br>The frequency response has been expanded to 100 kHz to support next-generation audio formats such as SACD.<br><br>Equipped with 5.1 channel input jacks.<br>This jack can also be used as an input jack for 3-1 stereo.<br><br>Component video input / output terminal is mounted.<br><br>The heat sink is a sf heat sink.<br>This heat sink uses a vibration dispersion fin structure to suppress fin resonance, and by inserting a different rib into each fin, tuning fork resonance is prevented and split vibration is suppressed.<br>In addition, the power amplifier block uses a horizontally opposed construction placed between a pair of sf heat sinks to ensure stable operation by creating a uniform environment with amplifiers for five channels.<br><br>The power supply section is equipped with a large power transformer that uses a wrapped core.<br>In the conventional EI core transformer, E-type and I-type magnetic steel sheets are individually laminated and then combined to form the core. In the wrap-packed structure, however, E-type and I-type magnetic steel sheets are alternately stacked on top of E-type magnetic steel sheets to form the core. As a result, there are no faults in the magnetic path, greatly reducing leakage of magnetic flux.<br>A pin-type transformer is used to extract the intermediate voltage from the coil of the transformer. For transformers of this size, lead wires are generally inserted into the coil for connection. However, in the lead type, winding disorder occurs due to swelling of the connection part. In the pin-type transformer, winding disorder does not occur because the coil is directly connected to the terminal, leading to high sound quality.<br><br>An eccentric insulator is used for the legs.<br>This insulator changes the phase of the transmitted vibration and cancels it by providing a screw hole avoiding the center.<br><br>Newly developed driver part integrated design is adopted for the display part, and FL tube of 2-line display is adopted.<br>By integrating the driver into the tube as an integrated LSI, it is difficult for lighting noise to leak to the outside of analog circuits. In addition, the two line display increases the amount of information.<br><br>On-screen capability.<br><br>Equipped with an FM/AM tuner.<br><br>Comes with a bi-directional wireless remote with learning and LCD capabilities.</p>
