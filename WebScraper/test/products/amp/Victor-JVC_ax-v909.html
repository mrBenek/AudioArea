				<p class="detail">An AV amplifier equipped with digital signal processing Dolby Prologic, digital acoustic processor and 6-channel power amplifier.<br><br>The AX-V909 uses digital signal processing of Dolby Pro Logic surround information and advanced digital signal processing to improve the dynamic range of the control signal by more than 20 dB. This greatly improves the sense of accurate sound movement, the sense of localization in small signals, and channel separation.<br>Four types of pro-logic mode are installed.<br><br>Equipped with a digital auto azimuth collector and auto balancer.<br>The directional enhancement circuit of Dolby Pro-Logic Surround loses the realistic sense of movement and orientation if there is a phase difference or level difference in the input signal. To solve this problem, the Digital Auto Azimuth Collector &amp; Auto Balancer uses digital signal processing to optimally and automatically adjust the phase difference and level difference generated during software production or signal output from a playback device in real time to extract the sound of Dolby Pro-Logic Surround.<br><br>DAP (Digital Acoustic Processor) is installed as a surround function to reproduce the realistic sensation in the actual performance venue.<br>To realize this function, JVC uses a unique symmetrical 6-point sound field analysis method using six microphones to actually measure the sound of famous concert halls around the world. We analyze the spatial characteristics of a 360-degree sound field by recording the sound spread in the hall with high precision. We also focus on the unique sound field characteristics of music software and listening rooms. With the cooperation of the software production side, we also analyze the sound field of recording studios and listening rooms. Together with the data obtained at the concert hall, we conduct comprehensive computer analysis together with data obtained at the concert hall. For the first time, we introduced a fully independent L/R signal processing system using stereo for the signal processing of these data, and we completed data without losing sound field components that were lost in conventional monaural (L + R) signal processing.<br>The AX-V909 has eight preset sound field patterns. In addition, you can adjust various parameters according to the reverberation time and space of the listening room. In addition, you can enjoy the original sound field according to your preference by installing two playback modes of 6 ch and 4 ch.<br>(Features are described in the specifications column)<br><br>The D/A converter is equipped with a K2 interface circuit and a DD (Digital Direct) converter.<br>The DD converter is a type of 1-bit D/A converter that converts digital signals into 1-bit pulse waves that vary based on the crystal clock, and directly converts them into analog signals. Because the bits are not stacked, the 0 cross distortion caused by amplitude error that occurs in conventional ladder-type D/A converters does not occur in principle, greatly improving the ability to reproduce at a minute level.<br>The DD converter consists of three parts : 8 x oversampling digital filter + VANS 4th-noise shaper + PEM DAC. The newly developed VANS noise shaper compresses the data output from the digital filter into data suitable for the 1-bit PEM DAC. The requantization noise generated at this time is eliminated by 4th-noise shaping for the first time in the 1-bit DAC. Thus, the dynamic range is expanded. The PEM DAC converts the input data into high-precision, high-resolution pulse waves that vary with the crystal clock and directly converts them into analog signals.<br><br>With digital input, both Dolby Pro Logic Surround and DAP can be used for digital direct pure playback without D/A conversion on the player side or A/D conversion on the AX-V909.<br><br>The A/D converter is equipped with a 64 fs fourth order noise shaping 1-bit dual A/D converter.<br><br>Equipped with a digital delay, it can be changed from 15 to 30 msec in 1 msec steps.<br><br>The power amplifier section is equipped with a fully discrete 6-channel power amplifier.<br>In addition, the front channel 2 and center channel 2 are equipped with Dynamic Super A and are designed with an emphasis on sound quality.<br><br>The power amplifier section is surrounded by a heat sink in the internal construction to shield the delicate input signal processing section from noise, and the power transformer is mounted via a vibration control base to eliminate vibration.<br><br>The AC cord is made of oxygen-free copper wire and the power condenser is made of carefully selected materials in pursuit of higher sound quality.<br><br>The speaker output has eight channels for Dolby Pro Logic Dual Center / DAP.<br><br>Equipped with four digital inputs including two optical inputs and Route 6 audio inputs. Equipped with Route 6 video inputs, all of which are equipped with S jacks.<br>The digital (coaxial), video and audio connectors are gold-plated.<br><br>It has a Route 6 pre-out connector that can be used as a Dolby Pro Logic Surround / DAP processor and a main in connector that can be used as an independent 6-channel power amplifier.<br><br>Equipped with an AV independent REC selector that can select sound and video sources separately.<br><br>Equipped with Y/C separation circuit which is convenient for editing from conventional VTR to S-VTR.<br>It is also equipped with an enhancer that can correct image contours.<br><br>It is equipped with an on-screen function that can display the operation status in text on the TV screen.<br>The on-screen display shows you how your speakers are being used, and shows the center and rear channel levels in decibels.<br><br>Equipped with a test tone function, you can adjust the speaker volume balance.<br><br>There are 2 color variations, gun metallic and black.<br><br>A programmable remote controller is included as a remote controller to control other AV devices.<br>This remote control is equipped with a learning function, and can store up to 174 types of remote control signals for up to 18 models, including VTRs, TVs, video disks, BS tuners, CDs, DAT, and decks.</p>
