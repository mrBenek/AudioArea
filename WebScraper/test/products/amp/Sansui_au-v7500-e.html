				<p class="detail">This AV surround amplifier was developed with the goal of developing an AV amplifier with the same quality as pure audio.<br>There are 2 types, AU-V7500G in gold color and AU-V7500B in BlackCar color.<br><br>Equipped with Dolby Pro-Logic Decoder and supports Dolby Pro-Logic Surround.<br>To maximize the effects of Dolby Pro-Logic Surround, you can adjust the channel balance of the inputs with the Auto Input Balance feature, which provides stable decoding. This feature allows you to enjoy Pro-Logic Surround at your discretion without having to adjust each software individually.<br>Four surround modes with pro-logic playback are available.<br>In normal mode, a small speaker is used in the center, and the signal below 100 Hz is sent to the front L/R for playback. In wide mode, a speaker of the same quality as the front L/R is used in the center.<br>Phantom mode is a mode in which the sound is played back by four speakers at the front and rear, and the center signal is equally divided into front L and front R for playback.<br>The Dolby 3 stereo mode is designed for the front 3 ch without the use of the rear speaker. The rear signal is mixed with the front L/R to produce a surround effect.<br><br>In addition to the Dolby Pro Logic, you can choose from a matrix that outputs the front 2 as it is and outputs the reverberation sound from the rear, a hall that reproduces rich reverberation with a concert hall, a stadium that reproduces the scale of a wide space live concert or sports event, and Natural that reduces the sound field that spreads naturally against the rich source of reverberation components.<br><br>It is equipped with a digital delay function to create sound field space more realistically.<br>In addition, this digital delay operates at a high S/N ratio with an input level control function for adjusting the optimum input level.<br><br>The 5 discrete power amplifiers enhance the surround effect by considering the front / rear power balance. By designing the front and center outputs equally, the ideal condition of &quot;L/R / Center drive with the same quality and power&quot; of Dolby Pro Logic is satisfied.<br>In addition, two center speakers can be connected to prevent missing sound such as vocals, dialogue, and sound effects from right to left.<br><br>Equipped with on-screen function, you can check information about sound field and image on television monitor.<br>(This function is not supported for S terminal output.)<br><br>To eliminate interference between audio and visual signals, the power supply uses an A/V independent power supply, a powerful power transformer for AV, and a large heat sink.<br>In addition, we carefully select individual parts such as audio-only capacitors, high-speed diodes, and copper screws.<br><br>Equipped with Triple Tone Control, you can control bass, mid and treble independently of each other.<br><br>It is equipped with a visual Line 5 corresponding to the S terminal and a total of 10 input systems.<br>The input terminal (L terminal with mono switch) is also mounted on the front panel.<br><br>Equipped with FL display which shows various situations corresponding to operation.<br>This display can also be turned off.<br><br>It is equipped with a Video Rec Selector that can dub a different source than the one you are watching, and an A/V parallel dubbing function that can dub a CD while dubbing a video.<br>It is also equipped with an AV mix recording and playback function that can combine video images with audio from CDs, Phono, etc.<br><br>Built-in pre-out and power-in terminals.<br><br>Equipped with an easy-to-adjust auto-mode test tone circuit, each channel can be adjusted while automatically cycling.<br>In addition, it is equipped with the manual mode, which is also used in commercial equipment. The output level and tone can be adjusted by temporarily fixing the test tone to an arbitrarily selected channel.<br><br>It is equipped with a programmable remote control that can be operated from power ON/OFF to function selection, volume adjustment, surround mode setting, etc. This remote control is equipped with a learning function and can also operate video and television.<br><br>There was a side wood sold separately.</p>
