				<p class="detail">An integrated amplifier that uses a vacuum tube and MOS FET to pursue high-quality music playback.<br>The know-how of the Brid series is further refined as a music player and upgraded in all aspects including the power supply circuit.<br><br>FET is applied to the first stage differential circuit, 3-pole vacuum tube is applied to the second stage differential section, and MOS FET is applied to the power stage. All signal paths are composed of high-impedance circuit by voltage control amplification. By this, the power of MOS FET is obtained while the taste of vacuum tube is brought out.<br>As a result of a result of adopting a vacuum tube, the first stage input circuit can be handled by a P-channel FET, which is more advantageous than an N-channel FET in terms of gate leakage current, etc. In addition, the use of a high-gain, low-noise FET, 2SJ75, also shows superior sound quality.<br>The f characteristic is improved by further increasing the input impedance with the booth trap and cascade connection.<br><br>The circuit configuration consists of a current mirror + vacuum tube differential, and music signals are amplified based on a fixed reference point, enabling highly accurate information transmission.<br><br>In the power supply section, a large super regulation transformer with a capacity of 50 VA is used as the power transformer.<br>A block capacitor with a total capacity of 32800 μ F is used to supply power to the power stage for low impedance. To ensure a pure power supply for each block, five independent secondary windings, including the power section, driver section, and phono equalizer section, are taken out to prevent mutual interference.<br>In addition, a high-precision regulator circuit with a critical response is inserted everywhere to reflect stable music expression.<br><br>The heater power supply is a constant current circuit to prevent the fluctuation of the AC power supply from reaching the heater, while protecting the vacuum tube from the normal constant voltage drive rush current (large current flows instantaneously).<br>In addition, the vacuum tube 6CG7 is tuned to the best operating condition by finely adjusting the heat-up level.<br><br>The STAR circuit is used to supply power directly to each stage without sharing the ground line or feed line from the power supply, and the ground line is independently transmitted to the reference point of the amplification.<br><br>The phono amplifier consists of a low-noise FET and a high-speed operational amplifier.<br>Along with the adoption of a differential detection regulator, we have brought out the characteristics of analog disks.<br><br>It is equipped with Route 3 video input and monitor terminals. One system is equipped with an output terminal, and dubbing from AV2 to AV1 is possible.<br>The video signal has a built-in wide-band video buffer circuit for impedance matching between AV devices. It has characteristics such as phase variation (DP) within 2 degrees, gain variation (DG) within 2%, and bandwidth of 6 MHz. Even when connected to a large monitor TV, it transmits video without color shift or color change.<br><br>It has a CD straight function that bypasses all circuits such as function switches, tone control, signal processor and balance, and sends the CD source to the power amplifier in the shortest distance.</p>
