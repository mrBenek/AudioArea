				<p class="detail">This is a pre-main amplifier with improved cost performance while applying Luxman&#39;s technology.<br><br>CSSC (Complementary Single Stagger Circuit) circuit is adopted for the amplifier section.<br>This circuit is roughly divided into three parts. From the input side, it consists of a the second stage current transmission stage, and the final stage output circuit. The differential amplifier gains the inherent gain of the amplifier circuit. The current transmission stage uses a common-base transistor circuit that is used in high-frequency circuits that require high fT (cutoff frequency) transmission. The final stage is the output circuit. The control amplifier converts impedance, and the power amplifier amplifies power. complimentary service<br>Many general amplifiers have amplification functions in the first and second stages. Since the cut-off frequencies of the first and second stages are approximate values, there is a large phase shift in the ultra-high frequency range as a total characteristic. Therefore, analog information from the output is inverted and returned to the input using NFB. This structure improves electrical characteristics. However, when a large phase shift occurs, the feedback becomes close to positive, and positive feedback oscillation or similar unstable state occurs. In order to avoid this, another local feedback loop is used as a complementary loop. However, this high-frequency correction loop itself greatly affects sound quality and causes a loss of natural feeling of sound.<br>In the CSSC circuit, the cut-off frequency in the high-frequency range is extremely high in the second stage common-base type current transmission stage. Therefore, it can be said that the frequency characteristics of the first stage differential amplifier control almost the entire CSSC. Stable operation can be ensured with minimal correction, and high-through rate is achieved.<br><br>It is equipped with LUX&#39;s unique OD β circuit.<br>The OD β circuit is the β circuit (NFB) of the amplifier, to which LUX added its own ingenuity. In a general amplifier, the NFB is fed separately in the direct current and AC regions. However, by inserting a DC servo amplifier into the feedback loop in order to ensure stability in the DC region, a difference in balance with the AC region was caused. In the OD β circuit, excellent DC stability is ensured only by basic DC feedback without incorporating a DC servo amplifier by refining the bare characteristics of the circuit to a high degree. In addition, the NFB in the AC region has been optimized to adjust the energy balance in all bands and achieve a sense of uniformity in tone quality in all frequency bands.<br><br>The power amplifier has a 3-stage Darlington configuration and uses a complimentary service circuit with low internal impedance, high current, and high fT type power transistors (Pc150W, Ic (max) 15A).<br>In addition, stability is improved by using parts such as a large heat sink with a shape that reduces unnecessary noise while maintaining heat radiation characteristics, a high-voltage transistor, and a dual transistor for differential amplification.<br><br>The power supply section uses a high-efficiency large EI core power transformer and a large-capacity capacitor with excellent instantaneous charge / discharge characteristics.<br>The low impedance design low-impedance design makes it possible to supply music in accordance with the phase of music.<br><br>The speaker terminal uses a vise screw type made of a unique material so that the cable can be firmly fixed.<br>This connector is also compatible with a banana plug.<br><br>It comes with a wireless remote control that controls basic functions such as power on / off, input select, volume control, and muting on / off.<br>The volume and input selector are motor-driven, and the input selector is equipped with a clutch mechanism to give a click feeling when manually operated and to improve operability. In addition, the remote control can be operated smoothly.<br><br>Equipped with bus line terminals, it is possible to link the remote control operation with the LUXMAN CD player.<br><br>The internal layout is designed to prevent unnecessary vibration and noise. The overall structure is symmetrical to maintain weight balance. Each section is laid out in minimize interference while ensuring extremely high stability. In addition, a box isolation structure with shield plates is employed to completely eliminate high-frequency noise and leakage flux.<br><br>The aluminum front panel has a special satin finish, which is combined with a lustrous wooden box finish to create a luxurious feel.<br><br>The front panel is equipped with a power meter.<br>This meter uses a logarithmic compression method and realizes a unique atmosphere by focusing on the color scheme.<br><br>The internal circuit uses custom-made parts designed for L-509s.<br><br>It includes tone control, loudness and subsonic filter, balance control, recording selector, and mode selector.<br>It is also equipped with a line straighter function, which can provide high quality sound by bypassing unused circuits (tone control, mode selector, left / right balance).<br><br>The headphone jack has a dedicated relay contact to eliminate the influence on the speaker jack.<br><br>An inverted switch is mounted, and the phase of the balance line input can be inverted.<br><br>Equipped with line phase sensor, polarity can be checked when power plug is inserted.<br><br>Custom type power cable and AC inlet are adopted.<br><br>It is equipped with a bus line that links remote control operations of LUXMAN CD players.</p>
