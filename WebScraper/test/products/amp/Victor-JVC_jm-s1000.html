				<p class="detail">Laboratory 1000 series stereo power amplifier specially developed for professional use such as studio<br><br>The Laboratory 1000 Series was designed and manufactured by selected staff members of the Victor Laboratory Center. The characteristics of the Series are compensated by the measured data of all the machines, and the specifications can be changed slightly according to the purpose.<br>In addition to using highly reliable parts for all parts, it is checked up to one resistance and one knob.<br><br>The circuit configuration is a cascade operation input type front direct connection triple push-pull pure complimentary service OCL system.<br>The input circuit uses a cascade differential circuit that reduces the AC load impedance and performs stable wide-band amplification. The differential stability is improved by using a constant current circuit. In addition, by installing a constant current circuit in place of the bootstrap in the middle stage, a deep negative feedback ranging from DC to several hundred kHz is stably applied, and flat characteristics are obtained even small output and large output.<br><br>3287 cm for heat sink<sup>2</sup>Large x2 heat sink is adopted.<br>It is designed to withstand high-power operation for a long time. In terms of area, it is 1.5 times larger than newspaper. Moreover, it has a compact shape with a chimney effect.<br><br>A large toroidal transformer is used for the power supply. The toroidal transformer has a no-load loss of less than 1/10 compared that of the conventional EI core transformer. Since it operates with only 40 mA excitation current, it can extract a very large instantaneous rise current.<br>In addition, a 47,000 μ Fx2 large-capacity large capacitor is used, and the charged electric power is directly supplied to the power stage, so strong sound is realized even in a continuous large pulsed input.<br>In addition, a high-voltage stabilized power supply of ± 75 v is supplied to the pre-stage amplifier of class A operation to ensure stable operating conditions with good linearity.<br><br>It can also be used as a high-output monaural power amplifier by switching the front panel selector to BTL.<br>In this case, only Lch is connected and only system1 is connected to the speaker jack.<br><br>Equipped with rotary switch type input level control, accurate attenuation can be selected in 5 steps.<br>It also has independent sub-level volumes on the left and right.<br><br>The filter switch can cut frequencies below 18 Hz and above 27 kHz at 18dB/oct.<br><br>Equipped with an automatic return type 3 Oshige point protection circuit.<br>This protection circuit prevents shock noise at power ON/OFF, disconnects the speaker when abnormal midpoint potential is detected, and protects the power transistor when output is short-circuited or excessive input is detected.<br><br>Equipped with 4-way power limiter.<br>With this function, the maximum output can be reduced to 1/2, 1/4, or 1/8 of the full power according to the efficiency and input resistance of the speaker. The operation of the limiter is indicated by the light emitting diodes.<br><br>A cast-aluminum side frame is used for the side frame.<br>Mount size is BTS standard and can be changed to RCA type depending on the order.<br><br>The meter section uses a peak-VU simultaneous display meter.<br>This newly developed meter can simultaneously monitor the average meter input level and the peak level. It can be displayed by a light emitting diode embedded in the scale surface. + 7 dB of the meter peak value corresponds to the saturation level of a cassette deck, and + 12 dB corresponds to the saturation level of an open reel deck. This meter can also be used to check the recording level.<br>The meter has a response speed of 10 ms and a recovery time of 300 ms, the VU meter complies with the BTS standard and the meter sensitivity can be changed in three stages.<br>This meter is a complete type with built-in drive circuits such as buffer, rectification, peak detection, digital circuit, etc., and can be used by itself if a power supply is prepared (the catalog says that it will be sold separately).<br><br>The power supply is a universal system of 100 V, 117 V, 220 V and 240 V. It can be used overseas simply by changing internal connections.</p>
