				<p class="detail">This is a pre-main amplifier that has carefully reviewed the basics of amplifier design and generously introduced advanced technology to achieve the ideal of vividly depicting the life of live music transmitted by digital sources.<br>The circuit structure is designed to be simple and straight. The amplifier circuit is simple with only a phono equalizer and a power amplifier. This greatly reduces the accuracy of the amplifier elements and other unstable factors in sound quality.<br><br>G-chassis has been adopted in pursuit of a vibration-free and resonance-free design.<br>The G-Chassis is named after the Rock of Gibraltar, a small peninsula located at the southernmost tip of Spain, and is called the Equatorial Tuned G (= Gibraltar) Chassis.<br>The material is made of calcium carbonate with the same composition as marble, unsaturated polyester and reinforced with glass fiber (glass fiber) based on considerations such as sufficient mass, resistance to resonance from external vibration, and large internal loss that quickly attenuates when vibration occurs.<br>Because it is non-magnetic and non-metallic, it does not generate electro-striction and eddy current induced by magnetic fields such as transformer and condenser, and it reduces sound quality degradation from an electrical point of view. It is also an excellent chassis that can ignore aging due to heat and temperature.<br>In order to eliminate partial resonance and split vibration that occur at the protruding part, the protruding part is eliminated. In addition, the thickness of each part of the chassis is sufficient, and the rigidity is improved by running ribs vertically and horizontally.<br>By randomly changing the feeling between ribs and the thickness of the ribs, consideration is given not to have a specific resonance mode.<br><br>The power supply uses a large 350 VA transformer and S. T. D. (Spontaneous Twin Drive) power supply system.<br>In this system, rectifier circuits are installed independently in the power supplies of the A-class stage and the power stage constituting the power amplifier to prevent the power supply of the A-class stage from being dropped and to compensate for voltage fluctuations that tend to occur in power stages that require a large power supply. This enables the A-class stage to operate stably without interference from the power stage even at high output.<br><br>The power amplifier uses the S. L. L. (Super Legato Linear) method, which drastically reduces the switching distortion and crossover distortion of the output stage in a wide bandwidth and wide dynamic range, and realizes low-distortion reproduction.<br><br>The phono equalizer amplifier for MC cartridges has excellent high-frequency response characteristics and employs a low-noise Hi-gmFET to eliminate TIM distortion. It is also equipped with a 3-position cartridge load selector support a variety of cartridges.<br><br>The tone circuit does not use a tone amplifier but consists of only passive elements, greatly simplifying the circuit and improving sound purity.<br>Two types of turnover frequency can be selected using the Bass and Treble switches, and a tone circuit can be passed using the Tone switch.<br><br>The Source Direct Switch allows you to enjoy higher fidelity playback of CDs and other sources, allowing you to skip circuitry such as tone controls, subsonic filters, balance, mode switches and more.<br><br>Equipped with a subsonic filter that can cut unwanted ultra-low frequencies that are harmful to speakers with one touch.<br><br>Equipped with an adapter OUT/IN jack that loops the signal selected by the Input Selector to the connected device.<br>A graphic collizer can be used.<br><br>Gold plated terminals are used for the CD and Phono inputs.</p>
