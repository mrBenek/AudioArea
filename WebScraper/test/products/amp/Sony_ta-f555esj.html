				<p class="detail">Pre-main amplifier with all-FET amplifier configuration and non-magnetic power MOS FET output stage.<br><br>A newly developed non-magnetic power MOS FET (Metal Oxide Semiconductor FET) exclusively for audio is used as the output stage device. Power MOS FET is a MOS FET originally developed as a small-signal switching device that enables high-power amplification while maintaining excellent high-frequency characteristics and switching speed.<br>Since this element has high input impedance, the load on the driver stage is small, and high sound quality can be obtained with a relatively simple circuit structure. In addition, since it has a transfer function of square characteristic, distortion is mainly of even order, and there is little adverse effect on sound quality. Since it is a voltage control element with insulated gate, the driver stage and output stage can be electrically separated, and mutual interference can be eliminated.<br>Eight power MOS FETs are used at the output stage, with two parallel push-pull pairs per channel. In addition, MOS FETs are also used at the voltage amplification stage (A-class stage) and driver stage to realize an all-FET amplifier configuration from input to output.<br><br>The chassis structure uses a G-chassis designed with no vibration or resonance.<br>The G chassis is made by adding calcium carbonate, the main component of marble, to unsaturated polyester and reinforcing it with glass fiber. While it has high strength, it has high internal loss and excellent vibration damping characteristics. This suppresses external vibration and internal vibration generated in the power supply section, etc. and greatly reduces the generation of modulation noise caused by vibration and resonance. Also, since the G chassis is non-magnetic and non-metal, it does not generate electro-striction and eddy current which are induced from power transformer and condenser, etc. and has an advantage in sound quality.<br>The top plate of the TA-F555ESJ has a G-roof made of the same material as the G-chassis, increasing the rigidity of the amplifier itself.<br><br>To mount each part on the G chassis, the audio circuit board and power transformer are directly mounted and fixed, and the front panel, terminal panel and case are fixed on the G chassis with a connecting angle.<br>The heat sink uses extruded aluminum material with a base thickness of 20 mm.<br><br>The power supply section is equipped with a Spontaneous Twin Drive (S. T. D.) power supply that supplies the A-class stage for voltage amplification and the B-class stage (output stage) for power amplification of the input signal of the power amplifier section separately and independently from the rectifier circuit. Thus, the power supply of the A-class stage does not shake even at high output, enabling stable power supply at all times.<br>We have also adopted power transformers and capacitors that have been considered in terms of sound quality. The transformer is a large-capacity power transformer with a shield case. In addition, internal core materials and fillers are also selected through repeated hearings. Aluminum electrolytic capacitors for audio equipment are used as capacitors.<br>Furthermore, in terms of mechanism, the A-class stage and B-class stage condensers are arranged separately, and the B-class stage condensers are fixed to the vibration platform to prevent vibration and resonance.<br>In addition, the power supply circuit and audio circuit are made of carefully selected parts such as molding electrolytic capacitors and copper-clad electrolytic capacitors.<br><br>Uses newly developed volume with low distortion printing resistance and non-magnetic, gold-plated sliding brush.<br><br>The S. L. L. (Super Legato Linear) method is used in the output stage to reduce switching distortion and crossover distortion, and to further reduce distortion at the reproduction level in actual use.<br><br>A phono equalizer amplifier using a low-noise FET is built in.<br><br>It uses a source direct switch that bypasses tone control and mode switching.<br>It also has a direct-in terminal that bypasses the input selector.<br><br>Equipped with an adapter input / output terminal that is useful for connecting surround processors, etc.<br><br>Equipped with an ES filter to prevent noise from the AC line.<br><br>Copper foil 70 μ m thick OFC circuit board is adopted.<br><br>Uses brass machined gold plated pin jack terminal and gold plated speaker terminal.<br><br>Equipped with a subsonic filter.<br><br>There are 2 variations, gold and black.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
