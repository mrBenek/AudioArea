				<p class="detail">A prestige model AV amplifier developed as a reference model of Pioneer.<br><br>Equipped with a full digital Dolby Pro-logic circuit.<br>In addition to steering logic (directional enhancement circuit), which is important for Dolby Pro Logic, full digital processing has been applied to circuits such as auto input balance and deformed B noise reduction, resulting in greatly improved transmission characteristics and distortion characteristics.<br>In addition, the analog input signal is converted into a digital signal by an A/D converter before being input, which greatly reduces crosstalk between channels and S/N degradation during decoding.<br><br>It has a unique sound field control function.<br>We analyze sound field data from famous halls and jazz clubs around the world using a computer simulation method, and integrate the data into a 50-bit DSP developed by Pioneer, making it possible to reproduce sound fields.<br>There are four types of sound field programs : Hall, Jazz, Disco, and Simulated Surround. You can enjoy the original Hall effect by controlling the effect level that matches your image. In particular, Simulated Surround can create a stereoscopic sound field even with monaural software.<br><br>Four digital inputs (optical and coaxial) are installed, and the sound field control and tone control are processed by digital signals. Especially, the digital input of LD sound is processed by direct input to the Dolby Prologic circuit and sound field control for higher quality.<br>The D/A converter is equipped with a 1-chip real 20-bit D/A converter in the front L, R and center independently.<br><br>5-channel all-discrete configuration is used for the power amplifier section.<br>In the power supply section, the capacitors are wound in the opposite direction to eliminate interference between the capacitors. In addition, we are working to improve sound quality by adopting a direct construction method that reduces sound quality degradation by minimizing the signal path and by reviewing the ground line.<br><br>Construction has achieved a strong and highly rigid structure by adopting honeycomb frame and honeycomb heat sink along with greatly improving strength by making the floor plate 1.6 mm thick.<br>In addition, panel stabilizers made of vibration-proof rubber have been added to the left and right sides of the front panel to prevent the occurrence of small vibrations around the front panel. In addition, the volume knob is made of solid wood, which is machined out of aluminum, to suppress the sound quality degradation due to resonance.<br>In addition, various high-quality parts are used, including electrolytic capacitors carefully selected through repeated trial listening.<br><br>It is equipped with 5-channel independent digital tone control in order to correct the sound quality of the speaker and obtain a more natural moving feeling and sound field. The digital method prevents deterioration such as phase distortion and enables accurate adjustment.<br><br>It is equipped with a base synthesizer function that detects the low-frequency component of the signal and creates a low-frequency half of it.<br>In the VSA-1000D, the operation accuracy is improved in order to prevent interference with the ultra-low frequency component, which was included in some sources, and this interference is eliminated.<br><br>It is equipped with functions such as a function backup that keeps the selector function even in standby mode, a VCR1REC selector that enables back-side recording independent of the source being played back, and a Y/C separation circuit that does not require connection even when dubbing from the composite input to the VCR1 connected to the S terminal.<br><br>Equipped with 5 ch pre-out terminal and subwoofer terminal.<br><br>Self-illuminated wireless remote control with learning function is included.<br>In addition to the self-illumination system and the conventional learning function, the multi-command function that can preset up to seven consecutive operations and call them up with one touch, the remote control input function for television and video, and the simple design with one button and one function have been improved to further improve operability.</p>
