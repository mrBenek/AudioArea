				<p class="detail">A pre-main amplifier developed based on the design concept of the ESR series.<br><br>The chassis uses an Acoustic Tuned G chassis (Acoustically Tuned Gibraltar Chassis) that pursues a vibration-free and resonance-free design from all angles including material and shape.<br>The G-chassis is made of calcium carbonate, the main component of marble, reinforced with unsaturated polyester and glass fiber. This material has superior vibration damping characteristics with greater internal loss than metals, and is also strong and capable of high-precision machining. In addition, this material is non-magnetic and non-metallic, so there is no electro-striction or eddy current induced by magnetic fields of transformers and condensers, etc., and from the electrical aspect, sound quality degradation is reduced.<br>The shape of the G chassis is designed with careful attention paid to acoustic characteristics. It has a very simple structure with no protruding parts. It eliminates partial resonance and split vibration that occur at the protruding parts. In addition, the thickness of each part of the chassis is sufficiently large, and the rigidity is increased by running ribs vertically and horizontally. In addition, the thickness of the ribs and the spacing between ribs are changed randomly so that there is no specific resonance mode.<br><br>The TA-F222ESR is based on an acoustically well-tuned G-chassis and uses a structure that makes each part more rigid when mounted. Main parts such as printed circuit boards for audio circuits and power transformers are attached directly to the G-chassis and firmly fixed.<br>The heat sink uses a double-sided fin type made of die-cast aluminum.<br>In addition, the front chassis, terminal panel, and case are mounted on the G chassis so that they reinforce each other with connecting angles at important points, thereby realizing a stronger chassis structure.<br><br>S. T. D. (Spontaneous Twin Drive) power supply is used for the power supply part.<br>In the S. T. D. power supply, the rectifier circuit of the power amplifier is separated into the A power supply for the A-class stage and the B power supply for the power stage to prevent interference between the A-class stage and the power stage at high output.<br>In addition, it is equipped with an ES filter to prevent noise from the AC line.<br><br>The tone circuit consists of only passive elements, so the amplifier circuit is simple with only two parts, the phono equalizer and the power amplifier.<br><br>The power amplifier employs the S. L. L. (Super Legato Linear) method, which reduces the switching distortion and crossover distortion of the output stage in a wide band / wide dynamic range. This not only reduces the distortion factor at the actual output, but also improves the distortion factor at the playback level in actual use.<br><br>The phono equalizer amplifier section for the MC cartridge uses a low-noise Hi gmFET that has excellent high-frequency response characteristics and eliminates TIM distortion.<br><br>The tone circuit consists of passive elements instead of active elements, and is equipped with a TONE switch that can pass the circuit with one touch operation.<br><br>A source direct switch is provided. Pressing this switch jumps through the tone control, subsonic filter, balance, mode switch, etc. The input signal selected by the INPUT selector is output through the minimum path of the attenuator and power amplifier.<br>It also has a direct-in terminal that does not pass through the input selector.<br><br>Equipped with an adapter terminal that is convenient for connecting a graphic equalizer, etc.</p>
