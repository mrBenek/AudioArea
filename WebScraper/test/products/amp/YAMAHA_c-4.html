				<p class="detail">A control amplifier that has acquired excellent overall mounting characteristics thanks to a current noise reduction circuit.<br><br>The basic circuit configuration is simple : an equalizer stage of a differential input current mirror cascode bootstrap with a low-noise dual FET developed by Yamaha ; a flat amplifier with almost the same configuration ; a tone control circuit with a continuously variable turnover frequency ; and an MC head amplifier.<br>In addition, Yamaha&#39;s original current noise reduction circuit is incorporated to improve the SN ratio when the cartridge is mounted.<br><br>The equalizer circuit consists of a differential-input current-mirror cascode bootstrap circuit at the first stage, a Darlington connection at the pre-drive stage, a DC-amplifier using pure complimentary service SEPP-OCL at the output stage, and a newly developed current-noise reduction circuit (PAT. PEND) to improve the SN ratio at the time of cartridge mounting.<br>Yamaha&#39;s low-noise dual FET is used for the first stage differential amplifier. This dual FET combines the electrical and thermal characteristics of two high-gm FETs with low-noise specifications in the same package. It has sufficient characteristics as the first stage element of a DC amplifier. The current mirror circuit has sufficient gain, and the two transistors act as a kind of push-pull circuit to cancel even order harmonic distortion. In addition, the cascode bootstrap circuit suppresses the degradation of the distortion factor due to the fluctuation of signal source impedance depending on the frequency when the MM cartridge is connected.<br>The second pre-drive stage is an emitter-grounded amplifier circuit with a constant current load using a Darlington connection. It reduces the load on the first stage and provides sufficient gain.<br>The complimentary service stage is a pure output-SEPP circuit using high-fT transistors with well-matched pair characteristics. A large output-voltage is obtained at a low distortion rate while reducing the output-impedance to less than 180 Ω to improve load stability.<br>In addition, excellent RIAA deviation is obtained by using resistors and capacitors with less error.<br><br>A newly developed current noise reduction circuit is incorporated in the equalizer circuit to improve the SN ratio when the cartridge is mounted.<br>This circuit focuses on the thermal noise of the load resistance of the cartridge. In order to obtain the desired load resistance, a 10 times higher resistance is used. The current noise reduction circuit produces an apparent desired load resistance. As a result, 1/10 of the used resistance becomes the load resistance, the input conversion noise current density is low, and the load resistance with less noise is obtained.<br><br>The input terminal of Phono1/2 is equipped with a cartridge load switching function which can select load resistance and load capacity in 5 stages for MM type cartridge respectively.<br>The load resistance can be selected from 100 Ω, 33k Ω, 47k Ω, 68k Ω and 100k Ω, and the load capacitance can be selected from 100 pf, 150 pf, 220 pf, 330 pf and 470 pf. The load resistance of 100 Ω is a position exclusively for the high-output MC type.<br><br>The MC head amplifier section uses symmetrical push-pull circuit with 8 dedicated transistors for the MC head amplifier.<br>Excellent performance is achieved by a luxurious circuit using eight low-noise transistors per channel.<br><br>The flat amplifier section consists of FET differential-input current mirror cascode bootstrap for the first stage, common-emitter amplifier for the second stage, and pure complimentary service SEPP-OCL for the output-stage. The configuration is almost the same as that of the equalizers.<br>The current mirror circuit on the first stage provides sufficient gain as a flat amplifier, and the two transistors function as a push-pull circuit to cancel out even order harmonic distortion. The complimentary service stage also uses a pure output SEPP-OCL with the same configuration as the equalizer circuit to provide low impedance for load stability.<br><br>By turning ON the Tone-Bypass switch, a very simple circuit configuration called a DC Equalizer-DC Flat Amplifier can be obtained.<br><br>The buffer amplifier that receives signals from the input terminals of Aux, Tuner, and Tape1/2 is a two stage amplifier circuit that uses an FET at the input stage and has little distortion. In addition, since the voltage between the drain and source of the FET is held at a constant voltage, the deterioration of the distortion factor due to changes in the signal source impedance is suppressed like an equalizer.<br><br>The tone control circuit is composed of a differential-input current mirror with low-noise transistor, common-emitter amplifier, and pure complimentary service SEPP-OCL.<br>In order to continuously vary the turnover frequency, a pseudo-variable inductor and a pseudo-variable capacitor are constructed by a circuit consisting of one FET and one transistor. Four pseudo-variable inductors and one pseudo-variable capacitor are used, one for each Bass and Treble. Since the inductor and capacitor are electrically produced, it is strong against electromagnetic induction, and high SN ratio and low distortion factor are obtained.<br><br>Equipped with subsonic filter and high filter.<br><br>High-precision, specially designed low-impedance 4-string volume is used. In order to improve the S / N ratio during actual use, 2 strings per channel are used.<br>This double volume is inserted into the inputs and outputs of of the flat amplifier (when Tone-Bypass on). The -∞～- is adjusted up to 26 dB at the output side of the amplifier, from -26dB to -4dB at the input side of the amplifier, and from -4dB to 0 dB at the output side of the amplifier. This greatly improves the S / N ratio in actual use and reduces residual noise to 0 when the volume is fully reduced.<br>In addition, since this volume is a low impedance type, the separation and distortion factor hardly change at any position from Min to Max, and good results are obtained.<br><br>The only coupling capacitor used for EQ outputs is a high-quality electrolytic capacitor and a Meiler capacitor in parallel, and a gold-plated Phono connector.<br><br>It is equipped with a headphone amplifier. The circuit configuration is a first stage transistor differential current mirror and a grounded emitter amplifier Darlington connection SEPP-OCL.<br>It also has a dedicated volume for level adjustment.<br><br>Equipped with -20dB audio muting circuit.<br><br>Equipped with a leave-out selector.<br><br>Relay circuits are mounted on Rec out and Pre out1/2 to prevent shock noise when power is turned ON / OFF.<br><br>Equipped with AC outlet.</p>
