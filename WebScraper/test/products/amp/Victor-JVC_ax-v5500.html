				<p class="detail">This AV amplifier was developed by gathering together JVC&#39;s amplifier technology and has been certified as THX ULTRA2.<br><br>In the power amplifier section, the high quality power supply by the independent power supply and the low distortion by the discrete 7 ch power amplifier realizes the high power of 150 w for each ch.<br>In the case of 5.1 channel playback, it is also equipped with a speaker management function that allows bi-amplifier connection, and it is possible to drive the main speaker with higher quality.<br><br>The chassis is reinforced with a highly rigid cross-frame Z (0) chassis and stay brackets to shut out adverse effects such as unwanted vibration and interference.<br>Furthermore, by adopting a four layer board and dividing each circuit into nine functional blocks, S/N is improved, digital noise is reduced, and mutual interference within the chassis is eliminated.<br><br>The power supply consists of an independent analog audio, digital, and video transformer. The power supply consists of a high-current rectifying circuit and a large-capacity capacitor. It is divided into three blocks : the Lch section, the Rch section, and the center ch section. This independent power supply reduces crosstalk between channels through the rectifying circuit.<br><br>The DVD player Speaker Settings have a negative effect on sound quality because they require you to reduce the level before adding in order to avoid overflow when adding in the digital domain.<br>To solve this problem, a precision downmix converter is installed.<br>This is an analog downmix technology for DVD-Multi and EXT7.1 ch analog multi-channel inputs. This technology enables speaker settings to suit rooms and equipment even for DVD-Audio software such as 96kHz/24bit/5ch or multi-channel sources for which speaker management is not allowed.<br><br>TI&#39;s 32/64bitDSP &quot;Aureus&quot; with 2000 MIPS for fixed-point arithmetic and 1500 MFLOPS for floating-point arithmetic is installed in the central part of digital processing.<br><br>It supports decoding of Dolby Digital EX, Dolby Pro Logic II, DTS-ES discrete / matrix, DTS NEO : 6, DTS 96/24, etc.<br>It is also compatible with Dolby ProLogic IIx, which seamlessly the 2 ch source to 7.1 ch, and MPEG-2 AAC, which is used for BS / terrestrial digital broadcasting.<br><br>It is equipped with a multi-channel DAP (Digital Acoustic Processor) jointly developed by Tokyu Construction Co., Ltd., which was engaged in the acoustic design and construction of Tokyu Bunkamura Shibuya Orchard Hall and other buildings, and Victor Acoustic Research Institute.<br>The introduction of computer-based sound field simulation technology has enabled us to extract sound field patterns, which were difficult to obtain by measuring reflected sound by conventional impulse responses, and to verify sound field patterns by human ears, enabling us to reproduce the sound field of a sound hole.<br>Surround sound of various formats can be extended to all 7.1 channel sound field data.<br><br>In addition to the ExtendedK2 processing used in high-end CD-players, the K2 technology is incorporated in the CC converter with a compression mode (real algorithm) for improving compressed digital signals.<br>This CC converter is mounted on 4 channels of front, center and LFE, and reproducibility is improved by high bit high sampling.<br><br>All 7.1 channels are equipped with a 192 kHz / 24-bit PEM-DD converter chip developed by JVC for DVD audio.<br><br>Interconversion (Y/C separation, mixing) of composite video signal and S video signal is possible.<br>Composite video input and S-video input can be converted into component signals and output, eliminating the need to switch the input on the display side.<br><br>Although it is a large amplifier, it has a design that does not use a cooling fan at all to improve quietness.<br><br>Equipped with an on-screen display function that can be superimposed on the video screen.<br><br>An audio delay function that compensates for subtle differences between video and audio.<br><br>Equipped with a phono equalizer that can play back analog records (not compatible with MC)<br><br>Equipped with 3D headphone mode where you can enjoy stereoscopic sound even with headphones.</p>
