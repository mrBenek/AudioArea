				<p class="detail">This top-of-the-line monaural power amplifier was developed by integrating the technologies and know-how accumulated over many years and pouring the latest technologies into it.<br><br>CSSC (Complimentary Single Stagger Circuit) circuit of pure complimentary service configuration directly connected to all stages is adopted in order to realize excellent rise of sound in wide band.<br>In the CSSC circuit, control is minimized by adding a complimentary service configuration to the single stagger circuit, and wide-band high-slew rate sound quality is obtained without excessive control.<br>The first stage is a complimentary service circuit of a dual FET with a high input impedance and a cascode-connected transistor, and the second stage is a current transmission stage with a grounded base. The cutoff frequencies are sufficiently high to achieve signal amplification without the need for extra phase correction.<br>The current amplifier stage is composed of a 3-stage Darlington complimentary service circuit with high amplification factor and six Pc 200W class multi-emitter transistors for the + signal and the - signal.<br>The B-10 uses a fully balanced CSSC configuration that combines two CSSC circuits. By canceling out the noise mixed into the signal at the time of output, the B-10 is resistant to external influences and improves S/N.<br><br>A discrete buffer amplifier with high-speed characteristics is used for impedance conversion of the input signal to ensure the stability of the signal to be sent to the balance amplifier.<br>The first stage has a source-follower configuration using a low-noise, high-admittance type silicon junction FET in the complimentary service, and the second stage has an emitter-follower configuration using a high-ft - and high-fhe-type ring-emitter transistor complimentary service.<br><br>It adopts OD β (Optimaized Dual NFB) circuit which is further developed from DUO β circuit of DC-separated feedback.<br>In the general NFB method of DC and AC separate feedback, a servo amplifier was used to provide a large amount of NFB in order to control DC feedback, which has a large effect on the low frequency range. However, AC feedback, which has an effect on the middle and high frequency range, does not have this process. Therefore, the sound quality of the middle and low frequency range is inconsistent.<br>In the B-10, by improving the bare characteristics of the circuit, sufficient control is possible even if the DC servo amplifier, which was unnecessary in terms of sound quality, is eliminated, and a uniform natural reproduction sound is realized over all bands.<br><br>The power supply uses a large 800 VA EI transformer with high regulation and excellent dynamic tracking to music. Three independent windings are used for each circuit to eliminate mutual interference.<br>The block capacitor is equipped with four custom-made 22,000 μ F capacitors specially developed for the B-10, thereby increasing the instantaneous current supply capability.<br><br>A unique high-inertia power supply is used as the stabilizing power supply.<br>By increasing the regulation of the power transformer and ensuring the instantaneous supply capability with a large capacitor, the power supply section copes with voltage fluctuations and minimizes excessive NFB, which adversely affects sound.<br>By using this method, the unnatural voltage fluctuation, which fluctuates little, is changed into a slow fluctuation, enabling natural supply with almost no fluctuation when observed on a micro-scale.<br><br>The attenuator employs a 6-contact independent fixed resistance switching attenuator, which eliminates the stray current inside the printed resistor, which often occurs with conventional sliding continuously variable resistors, thereby preventing sound loss.<br>The resistor is a reliable military-standard large carbon-coated resistor (1W type) with 6 positions to choose from.<br><br>As a countermeasure against unwanted vibration and noise that adversely affect sound quality, a 5-point grounded FRP chassis base with excellent vibration absorption mode and stable operation is adopted.<br>In addition, the enclosure structure is a box-isolation structure to eliminate mutual interference between each circuit, and each stage is subdivided to reduce high-frequency noise and leakage flux.<br>In addition, a unique shape has been adopted to suppress the noise of the heat sink.<br><br>The power supplies such as transformers, rectifier diodes, and block capacitors are completely separated from the signal path and housed in a separate chassis. This independent power supply room system provides the same effect as a separate power supply while keeping the power supply inside the chassis.<br>Furthermore, the constant voltage circuit is separated from the power supply and placed on the amplifier side to eliminate interference noise.<br><br>The speaker terminal is equipped with an originally developed banana terminal and a large 3-way original speaker terminal for Y-lag.<br>In addition to the RCA terminal and the balance terminal, we have also adopted the Speakon terminal for the first time in domestic amplifiers.<br><br>Custom parts include large power transformers, block capacitors, non-magnetic resistors, electrolytic capacitors, copper-styrene capacitors, copper bus bars, and high-purity 6N cables.<br>In addition, a copper foil pattern set to 70 μ m and a glass epoxy board with excellent insulation are used to minimize impedance fluctuations.<br>The power cable is a custom-made AC inlet type.<br><br>It is equipped with a unique line phase sensor so that the polarity of the power supply can be detected at a glance.<br>By connecting a control amplifier with a remote control output, the B-10 can be turned on / off by remote control.<br><br>Equipped with a large power display meter.<br><br>The solid aluminum panel is uniquely textured with a special peer surface finish.</p>
