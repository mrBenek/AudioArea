				<p class="detail">This is a pre-main amplifier that integrates the design know-how of the Integra series and thoroughly pursues sound quality.<br><br>The power amplifier section uses a super-current amplifier configuration unique to Onkyo.<br>This amplifier uses a Bi-MOS drive system that performs voltage-current conversion before the output stage. The current drive amplifier achieves stable and linear amplification by current-current amplification.<br>The current drive amplifier is not affected by the voltage-to-current conversion characteristics of the transistor unlike the conventional output stage. It is composed of a current amplifier that supplies the output current to the speaker in proportion to the current sent from the previous stage. It has excellent linearity and does not vary with temperature.<br>The Bi-MOS drive system adopted in the previous stage is a circuit using two elements, a MOS FET and a bipolar transistor. In the low-current region, the MOS FET exhibits a gentle rise curve, and in the high-current region, the stretchy and linear characteristics of the bipolar transistor are dominant. As a result, characteristics close to a straight line are obtained in the crossover region, and linearity characteristics with elongation are realized even in the large-amplitude region.<br>In addition, this power amplifier section has push-pull specifications for all stages with perfect symmetry of + side / - side. The current drive amplifier stage of the final stage following the differential amplifier stage of the first stage, pre-driver and Bi-MOS drive stage is 3-parallel configuration.<br><br>A twin monaural configuration is adopted in which the left and right are independent. The small signal block is placed in the center, and the power section / power supply section for handling large current is placed on the left and right.<br>This reduces interference caused by electromagnetic waves from large currents and shortens the signal transmission distance.<br><br>The power supply section is equipped with two LASER transformers, one on each of the left and right sides, reducing the magnetic leakage flux radiated to the surrounding area to approximately 1 / 30 of that of conventional transformers.<br>In addition, the secondary winding of the power transformer is made independent for the power amplifier, EQ amplifier and protector circuit, and a sub-transformer is installed for the microcomputer to eliminate interference between each stage.<br><br>The chassis structure is a 3 box structure, and the power supply and power section for handling large current are housed on the left and right sides, and the input equalizer amplifier and preamplifier for handling small signals are housed in the central box to eliminate mutual interference.<br>The bottom chassis is also divided into 3 parts to reduce interference caused by chassis current.<br><br>In order to shorten the signal transmission distance and simplify the transmission, the selector switch of the motor drive is located near the input pin jack, and the volume is also located near the selector with an independent 4-chain type of the shaft drive to connect the signal transmission distance as short as possible.<br><br>The adoption of high-quality, low-impedance twin-roll Chemicon, high-speed diodes, and 70 μ m copper foil printed circuit board realizes low impedance circuits.<br><br>Onkyo&#39;s proprietary technologies such as Delta Turbo Power Supply and Pre / Power Section Independent Super Servo Amplifier are used.<br><br>It is equipped with functions such as source direct switch, direct tone circuit, tape monitor function, MC2 position cartridge selector, charge noise filter, etc.<br><br>It comes with a remote control that allows you to control the power supply, volume, input selector and muting at your hand.<br>The volume and input selector use a motor drive system to prevent non-linear distortion caused by semiconductor switches.</p>
