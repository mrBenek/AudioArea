				<p class="detail">This is a stereo power amplifier that pursues sound quality in all aspects such as Λ power supply, Λ loop, chassis structure, parts and internal layout.<br><br>Pure class A operation and class AB operation can be selected for SC-Λ 99 by switching the switch.<br>In pure class A operation, there is no degradation of sound quality because the distortion is not avoided by varying the bias as in a pseudo class A amplifier. Moreover, the best characteristics of the element can be drawn out because the bias point is placed at the best point of the amplifying element.<br>In class AB operation, the super f<sub>T</sub>The use of power transistors and low-distortion circuits reduces switching distortion to an undetectable level.<br><br>The circuit configuration is a fully symmetrical type with dual FET differential cascode connection, three stage Darlington connection, and triple parallel output stage. The power transistor is a super f of Pc150W.<sub>T</sub>By using a power transistor, we can obtain an allowable input with a margin, and by keeping the capacity and number of high-frequency phase correction capacitors small, we have succeeded in obtaining stable gain up to the high-frequency range.<br>One chip low-noise dual FETs (2SK90A-Nch, 2SJ90A-Pch) with excellent thermal balance are used in a fully symmetrical form. The input stage to the output stage are operated symmetrically to reduce the distortion factor. In addition, in order to ensure stable operation up to the ultra-high frequency range, all the amplification stages are configured as two stage amplification circuits by cascode connection. This improves the SN ratio by 7 to 8 dB compared to the conventional one. 270<br><br>When the speaker is driven, the diaphragm moves and a back electromotive force flows into the amplifier and distorts the speaker input signal. The SC-Λ 99 has a high damping factor of 500 and low output impedance, reducing the influence of the back electromotive force of the speaker.<br><br>Uses Orex&#39;s unique super Λ power supply.<br>In class A operation, the collector output impedance of the power stage, driver stage and pre-driver stage becomes small, so that the influence of the impedance of the power supply part appears. In SC-Λ 99, the super Λ power source adopted in SY-Λ 88II is developed to promote low impedance between AC power source and amplifier, and is adopted in the power supply part up to the pre-driver stage. This realizes ultra-low impedance and low noise of only 0.5m Ω from DC to 100 kHz.<br><br>The central part of the super Λ power supply section is simplified by using one stage differential, and the power supply section is provided with sufficient space by using parallel control power transistors.<br>In addition, two large and small transformers, a large power toroidal transformer and a driver toroidal transformer, are installed to further improve sound quality.<br><br>In order to achieve low impedance, the power switch is of large capacity, and rectifiers, newly developed electrolytic capacitors and various film capacitors are used in parallel.<br>Newly developed large-scale electrolytic capacitors for power supply are used. They are equipped with 18,000 μ F/80Vx4, 1.000 μ F/80Vx4, 820 μ F/80Vx8, and 560 μ F/100Vx4. In addition to low impedance, we are also working to reduce contact with dissimilar metals and prevent vibration. Solid capacitors for signal and power supply systems include copper foil styrene capacitors, u Λ -II type Λ capacitors, and copper foil film capacitors. In particular, film capacitors are manufactured by a special manufacturing method to suppress resonance over a wide range and realize high sound quality with little distortion. Electrolytic capacitors are also manufactured by a special manufacturing method based on consideration of film capacitors, and achieve an excellent energy balance.<br><br>A high-purity oxygen-free copper 280 μ m thick glass epoxy board is used for all printed circuit boards except for the indicator part. This reduces vibration by increasing the weight of the board while achieving low impedance.<br><br>As the emitter resistor of the output stage, a Λ loop including a Λ resistor using copper as a resistor is adopted, so that all the paths for large current flow are unified with elements using copper.<br><br>Two large extruded aluminum heat sinks are attached to the heat pipe that uses the heat of vaporization. This heat pipe achieves a high heat radiation effect. In addition, the power transistor in a sandwich structure made of a large aluminum material and a 2 mm thick copper plate. This prevents thermal imbalance in the power transistor and reduces the noise of the transistor as well as a high heat radiation effect.<br><br>Aluminum is used for the chassis.<br><br>In addition to the DC voltage detection type, the protection circuit adopts a double protection circuit equipped with an abnormal temperature detection of the heat sink.<br><br>A 15A AC cord has a polarity indicator to adjust the polarity of the power supply between devices.</p>
