				<p class="detail">This stereo power amplifier was developed as a successor to the P-300 series.<br>The design has been changed to the symmetric design used in the series of accu-phase power amplifiers, and the basic functions and other features are the same as those of the 300 series.<br><br>The large current capacity transistor is composed of 7-parallel push-pull, and a current of 210A is obtained in 1 ms.<br><br>A high-efficiency large 1 kva toroidal transformer is used for the transformer of the power supply section, and 40,000 μ F/80Vx2 is used for the smoothing capacitor. Flat output voltage is obtained from 20 hz to 20000 hz.<br><br>AccuPhase&#39;s original MOS FET + cascode push-pull circuit is used for the drive stage to improve the characteristics at the time of small signal.<br>In addition, the output stage is a bipolar transistor with a positive temperature gradient, and the drive stage is a MOS FET with a negative temperature gradient. By offsetting each other, a good and stable power amplifier is formed.<br>The predriver also uses a class A cascode push-pull circuit to increase the stability of the MOS FET.<br><br>The amplifier input uses a direct connection system in which the signal is directly applied.<br>Even a small amount of DC input can produce a large output and cause damage to the speakers. Therefore, the DC servo is applied to prevent amplification in the DC area and DC is cut off.<br>In this method, NFB is applied so as to suppress the output offset of the amplifier itself at the same time, so stable operation against temperature change is realized.<br><br>The input stage is a balanced differential pure complimentary service push-pull type, and a high-impedance / low-impedance FET input buffer amplifier is connected to the + (non-inverted) and - (inverted) inputs, respectively.<br>When a balanced input is used, it is directly input to these jacks for high-purity amplification.<br>When a bridge connection is made, the same signal is input to the + input of one amplifier and the - input of the other amplifier simultaneously.<br>In this way, no extra circuit such as a converter is added for all types of input, and homogeneous amplification is possible.<br><br>In addition to the normal 20k Ω RCA pin jack input, there is also a 40k Ω balance input. The international standard XLR-type connector allows the balance output of any impedance to be connected.<br>Since the balance input circuit is designed to inject the signal directly into the positive and negative inputs of the differential input circuit, it is necessary to insert a level control into each of the positive and negative inputs. Therefore, the P-360 uses a 1-dB step-by-step double-attenuator with less interlocking error. The input circuit is designed so that the frequency characteristics do not change at the position of the level control.<br><br>The bridge connection of the P-360 provides twice the output of the 4 Ω load in stereo operation.<br>In normal bridge connection, a phase inversion circuit is inserted into one amplifier. The P-360 uses the polarity of the differential input circuit of the two amplifiers to change the connection so that the signals are input opposite to each other. This is a pure switching circuit without inserting any special circuit.<br><br>The input level regulator uses a mirror-finished resistor with a particularly low distortion factor.<br>By mirror finishing, it has good strain characteristics and excellent wear resistance, and there is no grease or other material that impairs sound quality between brush resistors.<br>In addition, in general VR, the lead wire is sent out to the outside through the caulking part by the resistor, and the brush becomes the slider (rotor), but in P-360, the resistor becomes the rotor, and the brush part is fixed and comes out directly to the outside.<br>As a result, the number of metal joints has been reduced from five to three, reducing the adverse effect on sound quality.<br>The input circuit is - (inverted) and + (non-inverted), and consists of two circuits per channel. It is a 1-dB-step attenuator type with less interlocking error, and the input level can be controlled accurately.<br><br>A special amplifier for headphones is provided for high-quality sound reproduction by headphones.<br>The input stage uses an FET servocontrol amplifier, so it does not affect the main circuit.<br>You can control the volume of your headphones regardless of the volume of your speakers.<br><br>The output meter has a logarithmic compression of the output meter, the level reproduction between -50dB and + 3 dB can be seen at a glance. The output voltage at dB and 8 Ω load can be directly read.<br>It is also equipped with a switch that turns off the meter and lights.<br><br>The input is one balanced system and two unbalanced systems, which can be switched by the switch in the front panel.<br>Unbalanced line 1 is installed in the front sub-panel.<br><br>You can switch between two types of speaker output jacks.<br>It can also be driven by parallel connection with a changeover switch.<br><br>With a simple design and champagne gold finish, everything except the power switch is stored inside the lower sub panel.<br>Both sides have a natural Persimmon finish board.</p>
