				<p class="detail">An amplifier designed to pursue the ideal that &quot;an amplifier must be a single conductor with an amplification degree that faithfully transmits music signals&quot; as far as possible.<br><br>Approximately half of the space is the power supply. All stages are independent on the left and right, power stage, pre-drive stage, flat amplifier / equalizer and MC head amplifier are all independent 8 power supply configurations.<br>It is a 2-transformer system consisting of a 600 VA large-capacity toroidal transformer and an 80 VI ・ EI transformer. Custom large-capacity electrolytic capacitor 10,000 μ Fx8 developed exclusively for audio is connected in parallel. A 1.2 mm thick copper plate is used in the ground circuit. Therefore, even if the speaker impedance changes with frequency, stable operation is achieved by the powerful power supply.<br><br>Equipped with a diamond differential circuit and newly developed linear high-speed output device NM-LAPT (Non Magnetic-Linear Amp. Power Transistor), we succeeded in reducing TIM distortion and envelope distortion, which are dynamic distortions that interfere with sound quality, to as close to 0 as possible.<br><br>From large die-cast heat sinker to high-efficiency triple-braided speaker cable wiring, each part is selected based on a reliable characteristic check and hearing.<br><br>The power amplifier operation switch on the front panel can be used to separate pre-power and power.<br><br>Power is supplied to the power stage using two windings with independent left and right channels and a large toroidal transformer (power supply capacity 600 va) with good regulation by two rectifier circuits. In addition, a custom large-capacity electrolytic capacitor 10,000 μ Fx8 developed exclusively for audio is connected in parallel, and a 1.2 mm thick copper plate is used for the ground circuit.<br>The pre-drive stage uses a large EI transformer (80 VA power supply capacity) with two independent power supplies for both left and right channels to powerfully drive the diamond differential circuit.<br>The equalizer amplifier and flat amplifier are supplied from independent constant-voltage circuits on the left and right sides, and the MC head amplifier is supplied from independent low-voltage circuits on the left and right sides with separate windings.<br><br>The newly developed NM-LAPT with high breakdown strength and cut-off frequency (ft100MHz) as a power transistor with high speed and excellent linearity is made into a triple push-pull connection, and is used at an operating point with excellent linearity.<br><br>The head amplifier section is a DC amplifier configuration that further advances symmetrical push-pull input / output using newly developed low-noise, high-gmP-ch and N-ch FET. The first stage is a direct-coupled push-pull input in which a large number of low-noise, high-gmP-ch and N-ch FETs are connected in parallel, realizing ideal input impedance and high S/N ratio.<br>The second stage is an MC amplifier circuit with excellent linearity and excellent open-loop characteristics due to a push-pull drive double-stage direct connection circuit using a combination of NPN-PNP transistors.<br>In addition, extremely stable operation is obtained by supplying power exclusively for MC and independently for the left and right.<br><br>The equalizer amplifier section consists of a direct-coupled DC amplifier with a diamond differential circuit. The first stage has good pair characteristics, low-noise, high-gm, differential input circuit using dual FET, and cascode bootstrap circuit which is not affected by input impedance.<br>In addition, the high-performance constant current circuit (PAT. PEND) composed of a 2-stage direct-coupled circuit composed of NPN-PNP transistor combination provides high CMRR (in-phase component suppression cost) at the summing point and excellent dynamic characteristics. The second and third stages are diamond differential circuit + current differential push-pull with excellent drive capability, and the output stage is SEPP circuit with Darlington connection, which has sufficient current margin. The low-output impedance and low-impedance NF circuit design provides sufficient dynamic range even against changes in load impedance, and S/N ratio is improved.<br><br>The flat amplifier adopts a push-pull drive DC amplifier configuration with a differential input circuit using newly developed 1 Tip (4 elements enclosed) FET in the first stage, and achieves excellent operation by independent power supply on the left and right.<br><br>The speaker wiring cord from the LAPT uses a high-efficiency 3-layer braided structure with ultra-low DC resistance and low inductance to obtain excellent transmission characteristics without deteriorating the slew rate.<br><br>Uses CP type (conductive plastic) master volume.</p>
