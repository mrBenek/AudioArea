				<p class="detail">A carrier-type DAT recorder in which Pioneer&#39;s technology is condensed into an A4-size compact body.<br><br>A set of two 4-head drums for recording and playback and for monitoring has been adopted in the head part from Shinkai.<br>We have also developed a gate array LSI for signal processing timing control.<br>The head uses a high-output AT (All Track Structure) head that can handle high sampling mode with a margin.<br><br>Equipped with simultaneous recording and monitoring function.<br>This function allows you to check the source sound and the tape sound in real time before recording with one touch switching to prevent mistakes in important recording.<br><br>Equipped with 96 kHz high sampling (HS) mode.<br>Compared doubling the tape speed, operating speed of the signal processing LSI, and bandwidth of the head amplifier, compared with the conventional 48 kHz sampling, recording and in the ultra-high frequency range up to 44 kHz, which is more faithful to the original sound, is possible.<br>High-sampling mode recordings cannot be played back in conventional SP mode or LP mode due to the difference in the phase-mat, and the maximum recording time in HS mode is 1/2 that in conventional SP mode.<br><br>It is equipped with Legato link conversion.<br>Legato Link Conversion uses digital signal processing to connect the data of an audio signal with a smooth function curve so that the frequency component of the sound is closer to the original signal waveform. This makes it possible to reproduce the recorded sound closer to the original sound. This technology also reproduces the sound of 20 kHz or higher according to the 1/f attenuation characteristic by estimating the original signal before recording, thus realizing more natural sound reproduction.<br><br>A/D conversion section and D/A conversion section each use a 1-bit method.<br>Since the 1-bit method does not generate non-linear distortion or 0 cross distortion in principle, the conversion error of small signals is reduced.<br><br>Equipped with TOC recording / playback function.<br>TOC records the number of recorded songs and the time data of each song at the beginning of the tape. With the check button, the contents can be checked with one touch. As with CDs, recorded information can be managed and manipulated, and TOC functions can be expanded.<br><br>The LCD has a pop-up structure and a backlight, so that it can be used in a stationary state.<br><br>In addition to the conventional modes of 96 kHz High Sampling (HS) mode, 48 kHz Standard (SP) mode and 32 kHz Long Duration (LP) mode, it is equipped with a 44.1 kHz Standard (SP) mode with the same sampling frequency as CD.<br>This makes it possible to produce sound sources such as CDs or master tapes.<br><br>In addition to analog line input / output terminal (input is microphone / line switching type) and digital coaxial input / output terminal, optical digital input terminal is mounted.<br>96 kHz digital output is also available.<br><br>Comes with an AC adapter.<br>This adapter is a 100 V, 120 V and 230 V switching type and can be used in foreign countries (Adapter plug for foreign countries is not included).<br><br>Uses a dedicated ± power source battery.<br>Wide dynamic range of voltage is secured by ± power supply, and continuous recording of approximately 2 hours in SP mode and approximately 1.5 hours in HS mode is possible.<br>With a built-in battery charger, you can automatically charge the built-in battery pack just by connecting the AC adapter and turning the power switch OFF. The battery can be charged in about 3 hours. It also has a battery refresh function.<br><br>Equipped with auto (CD-Q code synchronized start) / manual ID recording function.<br><br>Equipped with an A-TIME (absolute time) recording function.<br><br>Equipped with functions such as Oatley number and end search, skip play, peak margin display, auto power off (when battery is used), and battery exhaustion display.<br><br>Equipped with a key hold function that can fix the operation set as a safety function.<br><br>Analog input with microphone / line input switching is installed.<br>The built-in microphone input amplifier is equipped with an attenuator for excessive input, and a low-cut filter for recording vocals and conversations.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.<br><br>Carrying case and belt are included.</p>
