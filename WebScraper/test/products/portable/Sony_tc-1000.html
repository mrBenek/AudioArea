				<p class="detail">This cassette recorder concentrates on the performance of large machines by pursuing the reliability and function of the mechanism without pursuing minimum size.<br><br>The TC-1000 is walkers or rollators for the elderly type and the TC-1000B is black matte finish.<br><br>The entire design uses an Integrated Print Circuit Board (IPB).<br>IPB is a high-density integrated printed circuit board. The printed circuit board and the resistor are solderless by processing the resistor and the lead wire into the printed circuit board using the printing technology. Thus, the printed circuit board and the resistor are solderless and high reliability is obtained and the space due to the resistor is eliminated.<br>The newly created space is equipped with a robust mechanism, and the use of a large motor ensures high reliability and durability even though it is a small cassette recorder.<br><br>Equipped with ソニオマチック automatic recording function with music / speech switching.<br>With the conventional automatic recording method, in some cases, such as during telephone recording, only your voice is loud and the voice of the other party is small. Therefore, the circuit function is switched according to the recording content so that you can record anything at any volume with good focus.<br><br>Equipped with an auto shut-off mechanism, the button returns automatically when the tape is finished during recording and playback, and the motor is turned off. It eliminates the failure to continue recording without noticing when the tape is finished, and unnecessary burden on the tape and mechanism.<br><br>The microphone is equipped with a miniaturized electret condenser microphone.<br><br>Equipped with an anti-rolling mechanism for better recording and playback while carrying around.<br>In the TC-1000, there is a flywheel directly connected to the capstan shaft to which the tape is sent, and there is another flywheel which rotates in the opposite direction. Therefore, even if vibration is received from the outside, the two flywheels cancel each other and prevent the fluctuation of the tape speed which causes sound vibration.<br><br>The drive motor is equipped with a servo motor.<br>The servo circuit automatically controls the motor rotation speed deviation caused by voltage fluctuations and tape load changes. The motor itself is also large and fixed with rubber cushion.<br><br>It is equipped with a cue mechanism that is convenient for heading.<br>If you press the FF/CUE button while the Play button is pressed, the tape will play back at approximately 1.5 times the speed.<br><br>I use a 5 cm cone type speaker.<br><br>There was a special rechargeable battery as an option sold separately.<br>This battery is a quick-charge type that can be fully charged in 6 hours, about 1 / 4 of conventional batteries, and can be used continuously for 3 hours.</p>
