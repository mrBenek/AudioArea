				<p class="detail">As the second generation of the Walkman, this model was designed to be compact and lightweight.<br><br>The WM-2 is designed to be smaller than the cassette case, which has the minimum capacity to store cassettes. The height is 0.5 mm lower than the cassette case and the depth is thinner than two cassette cases.<br><br>In addition to reducing the weight of the body, we have achieved a weight of 280g by simplifying the tape travel system and adopting ICs for the internal circuit.<br>In this weight reduction, we are pursuing a weight reduction of up to one screw.<br><br>By changing the tape insertion method and attaching the reproducing head to the cover side instead of the conventional one, we succeeded in reducing the movement of the head to approximately 1/2 and rationalizing the reproducing mechanism of each tape.<br><br>The operation system is a one hand control that can be operated with one hand. It is possible to control with one finger by arranging the buttons of the tape running instruction in one place.<br>In addition, it is equipped with an auto shut-off mechanism, and the mechanism automatically stops when all tapes are finished during playback, so there is no danger of battery exhaustion or damage to tapes.<br><br>Equipped with a 2-position switching type tape selector, you can choose characteristics that take advantage of each performance of metal tape and normal tape.<br><br>The drive motor uses a BSL coreless motor that boasts high rotational accuracy.<br>This motor has no brush or slot and does not produce uneven torque. Moreover, with the same shape as conventional motors, the power consumption is reduced by half while the torque is increased by two times. In addition, the servo effect of the built-in FG (frequency generator) enables stable rotational accuracy to be maintained.<br><br>The tape mechanism uses an anti-rolling mechanism.<br>In this system, two reversing flywheels are built in, and the flywheels cancel each other&#39;s vibration to prevent sound fluctuation even if an external shock causes a disturbance of the tape.<br><br>The WM-2 can operate with two AA batteries, allowing for approximately nine hours of continuous playback.<br>In addition, two D batteries can be used in the attached battery case for approximately 60 hours of continuous playback. When both batteries are used together, a maximum of approximately 69 hours of continuous playback is possible.<br><br>Equipped with 2 types of headphone jacks, 2 people can enjoy tape sound at the same time.<br><br>Equipped with an LED indicator, you can confirm that the Walkman is operating during playback, fast forwarding, and rewind.<br>When the battery is exhausted and the voltage decreases, the light turns off at approximately 1.5 v.<br><br>It is compatible with 3 power systems and can be used indoors or in a car by using not only dry batteries but also AC adapter and car battery cord sold separately.<br><br>Carrying case with shoulder belt is included.<br><br>Headphone MDR-4L1S is included.<br>This headphone is a 28g lightweight type, and a wide playback band is realized by a powerful magnetic circuit and a vibration film using a polymer film.<br>During a conversation, you can press the Walkman button in the middle of the headphone cord, and the built-in resistance attenuator reduces the volume of the tape.</p>
