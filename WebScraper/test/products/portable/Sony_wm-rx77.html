				<p class="detail">Walkman with a shining recording remote control.<br><br>Equipped with a luminous recording remote controller that integrates the functions for reliable recording into the remote controller.<br>This remote control features a slide-type recording switch that makes it more reliable and less likely to malfunction, improving recording operability. In addition, the three LED lamps on the front of the remote control enable you to check at a glance whether the tape is being recorded or on the running surface. In addition, since the beep sound comes from the headphone, it is easier to use even in dark places where the remote control is hard to see.<br>Also, by removing the headphone part, you can record with only the remote control part.<br><br>It has a Queue &amp; Review function.<br>If you press the FF or REW button while the tape is being played, you can listen to the squeaking sound during quick winding and look for gaps in the sound of the recorded tape.<br><br>Equipped with a recording mode switch.<br>You can switch between live mode, which is suitable for recording loud music, and conference mode, which is suitable for recording human voices.<br><br>Uses a sound swing guard mechanism (anti-rolling mechanism).<br>This mechanism was designed by analyzing the dynamic characteristics of vibration from the viewpoint of the moment of inertia of the flywheel and the stability of the motor. It maintains a stable rotating state even when subjected to vibration while walking, and reduces sound vibration.<br><br>Equipped with a newly developed comfortable volume switch (A. V. L. S) as a limiter function.<br>This function constantly monitors the state of the music signal during playback and controls the volume emitted from the headphones so that it does not exceed the point of sound leakage.<br><br>An EX amorphous head is used for the head part.<br>This head uses amorphous material and an EX mechanism with a special tape guide that keeps the angle between the head and the tape constant.<br><br>0.8 mm thick body plate has been adopted.<br><br>Equipped with a 10 minute quick charge function, it can be charged up to 50% of full charge in 10 minutes and fully charged in 30 minutes.<br>It automatically switches between fast charging and normal charging according to the remaining amount of the rechargeable battery.<br><br>A la carte headphone system is used for the remote control part, and the newly developed ultra-small micro plug is used for the remote control part so that the headphone can be replaced. The plug / jack part is gold-plated.<br><br>As earphones, sound leakage reducing headphones are included.<br>These earphones use a new teardrop shape that matches the shape of the ear, reducing sound leakage through the ear openings. The silent cap also reduces unnecessary sound leakage by limiting the opening from which sound is emitted to the ear hole. This reduces sound leakage by 70% compared.<br><br>The Dolby B type is installed as a noise reduction system during playback.<br><br>Equipped with an EXD. B. B. (Dynamic Bass Boost) circuit, you can enhance 50 Hz bass by up to 16 times.<br>In D. B. B., the emphasis is automatically adjusted according to the position of the volume knob at that time. In addition, in EX D. B. B., the amplification amount is linearly changed according to the volume change of the original sound to prevent the sensitivity of the weak sound from being lost.<br><br>Equipped with an auto tape selector.<br><br>Comes with a small stereo microphone and microphone stand.<br><br>There was a black ivory cream as a color variation.</p>
