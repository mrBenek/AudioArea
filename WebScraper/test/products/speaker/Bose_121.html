				<p class="detail">This small speaker system was developed by integrating 11.5 cm full-range unit technology.<br><br>There are 2 types of variations of 121 and 121 v for 121, and I could choose 2 types of vertical and horizontal.<br>Also, 121 can be step-up to 363 by combining with 242.<br><br>Equipped with 11.5 cm cone type full range unit D-222 for all band.<br>A special plastic is used for the frame part to prevent the magnetic field of the magnet from being magnetized to the frame, thereby improving the operation of the magnetic circuit for the voice coil and preventing magnetic disturbance. In addition, energy is extracted efficiently by adopting a shape that smoothly extracts back pressure of corn paper.<br>The cone paper contains mica, which is a mixture of layers of mica broken into fibers, to improve the response to the input signal by increasing the internal loss while maintaining the reality of the sound. The mica is characterized by increasing the hardness of the cone paper and increasing the response to the signal, but it is difficult to suppress the secondary mobility. The Bose is characterized by increasing the internal loss and suppressing the secondary mobility while maintaining the high rigidity of the cone paper by studying the mixing ratio to the cone paper and the materials. This realizes clear playback with good response over a wide bandwidth. In addition, the high-frequency characteristics are improved by adopting a unique curved shape.<br>Glass fiber is used for the center cap to achieve a smooth high-frequency response.<br>A new rubber-based edge is used for the edge part to improve response to a pulsed input signal and high-frequency characteristics.<br>The helical voice coil uses an edgewise winding, and thanks to the introduction of a computer, an aluminum ribbon wire with a ratio of 4 : 1 in length and width is wound on the bobbin with precision and no gap. As a result, a strong magnetic field and high input resistance are achieved.<br>Plastic foam is used for the damper.<br><br>The cabinet is made of MDF, which is high in height and density, and is approximately 1.5 times stronger than conventional particle boards, reducing unnecessary noise. While most MDF is a mixture of broad-leaved and conifer trees, the 121 uses 100% of carefully selected conifer trees to enhance acoustic sound reproduction.<br>In addition, the side panel is made of bird&#39;s eye maple with UV paint finish to give it a luxurious feel.<br><br>An aero-flare port is used for the bass reflex port.<br>By adopting the slit shape of this port, the peak of the reproduction sound due to the resonance of the port is suppressed, and the energy from the back of the unit is effectively utilized. In addition, before and after the pose, a newly designed aero-flare port which makes full use of hydrodynamics is installed, and by controlling the large amount of air and speed necessary for low sound reproduction, the port noise is suppressed, and the turbidity of low sound is eliminated.<br><br>The speaker terminal uses a gold-plated screw terminal that can be used with banana plugs or thick wires.<br><br>The 121 comes with a mounting plate for brackets that can be combined with Bose rich brackets.</p>
