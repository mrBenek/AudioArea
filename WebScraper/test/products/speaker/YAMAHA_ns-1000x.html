				<p class="detail">A speaker system developed with the objective of developing a monitor system for the digital age.<br><br>A 30 cm cone type unit is used for the low range.<br>While taking advantage of the high elastic modulus, specific elastic modulus, and tensile and compressive strength of carbon fiber, the vibration plate adopts a structure in which four unidirectional carbon fiber sheets using a special resin matrix are laminated and the direction of the fibers is radially aligned from the driving point to the periphery in order to ensure lateral rigidity.<br>In addition, the diaphragm shape is straight conical to take advantage of the compressive tensile strength in the fiber direction, and the rigidity in the direction perpendicular to the fiber is also increased by making the entire diaphragm highly rigid, making it easy to bend the outer circumference of the diaphragm, and providing corrugation on the back side.<br>The magnet uses a strontium magnet that realizes a magnetic flux density of 10500 Gauss and a total magnetic flux density of 220000 Maxwell. The frame is made of a special aluminum alloy diecast for acoustic with excellent homogeneity. The voice coil is a 66.6 φ edgewise wound long voice coil using oxygen-free copper.<br><br>A 8.8 cm dome type unit is adopted for the middle area.<br>High-purity beryllium is used as the diaphragm material, and it is finished as a lightweight type of 0.6g with a 8.8 cm diameter.<br>Strontium magnet is used for the magnet, and the magnetic circuit is composed of 18400 gauss of magnetic flux density and 150000 maxwell of total magnetic flux.<br>In addition, excellent linearity is ensured by the 66.6 φ edgewise wound voice coil and tangential edge which are excellent in space factor.<br><br>A 3.0 cm dome type unit is adopted for the high frequency band.<br>It uses high-purity beryllium and is a 0.028g lightweight type.<br>By connecting the voice coil of copper-clad aluminum wire directly to the diaphragm without using a bobbin, we take advantage of the lightness and hardness of beryllium.<br>By adopting a tangential edge with excellent center holding capability and a strontium magnet, the divided vibration range is moved out of the audible band.<br><br>The network is equipped with large ferrite cores, oxygen-free copper inductors, and MP (medium and high frequency) capacitors to reduce distortion.<br><br>The enclosure has been designed with sound quality in mind. By arranging the in-line center so that the units are positioned vertically in the center of the baffle surface, the directivity pattern on the horizontal plane is equal on the left and right sides. The left and right ends of the baffle are curved round baffles to suppress the influence of diffracted waves.<br><br>The enclosure is made of high-density particleboards.<br>It is designed with an emphasis on the overall strength balance. Inside reinforcement is also provided, such as the side plate with a total thickness of 45 mm and the woofer hollowed part of the baffle being attached to the back plate as reinforcement.<br><br>With the same specifications as the NS-1000X, there was also the NS-1000XW with American Walnut Real Wood Open Pore Finish instead of Real Wood Black Paint Finish.</p>
