				<p class="detail">A vertical twin type speaker system that employs an all-crystalline diamond diaphragm.<br><br>A 20 cm cone type woofer with an ALCC (alginate composite cone) diaphragm, which was developed in Shinkai over a period of four years, is used for the low range.<br>This diaphragm consists of a composite diaphragm made by mixing pulp with aramid fiber, and mixed with alginic acid fiber, which is made from alginic acid extracted from seaweed into threads and made into fibers. The alginic acid fiber functions just as a binder between pulp and aramid fiber, increasing the bonding strength between pulp and aramid fiber and improving rigidity.<br>The magnetic circuit employs a high-linearity magnetic circuit with 2.5 times the plate thickness of the conventional one. The voice coil is made into a short voice coil that fits perfectly in the magnetic gap, and the decrease in magnetic flux density is suppressed even when the voice coil is large in amplitude. In addition, the Alnico magnet with high magnetic flux density and low harmonic distortion is adopted.<br>In addition, the frame is made of zinc die-cast, which has a specific gravity 2.6 times that of aluminum, and the shape is designed to reduce air resistance to the diaphragm while reducing unnecessary vibration due to higher rigidity.<br>The surface of the Woofer gasket is treated with bristles to reduce the reflection of sound from cones and edges. In addition, the gasket itself has a damping effect and produces a reproduced sound with less noise turbidity.<br><br>A 3-cm dome type tweeter with a full crystalline diamond diaphragm is used for the high range.<br>This diaphragm is made of 100% polycrystalline diamond instead of conventional materials such as titanium coated with diamond. This diaphragm takes advantage of the characteristics of diamond that are close to the ideal diaphragm.<br>As a result, the sound velocity is approximately 3.3 times that of titanium, the reproduction frequency band is approximately 3.4 times that of titanium, and the internal loss is approximately 3 to 5 times that of titanium.<br>In addition, a new W. F. (Wave Front) director utilizing wave front control technology is adopted for the front of the tweeter. The director is made of Painted maple laminated material with high rigidity and excellent acoustic characteristics. In order to match the energy response with the woofer, the mounting position of the diaphragm is adjusted, and in order to improve the range of orientation in the vertical direction, the horn shape of the director is incorporated.<br>In addition, an alnico magnet is used for the magnetic circuit, and zinc die-cast, which has 2.6 times the specific gravity of aluminum, is also used for the flange of the tweeter. In addition, the surface of the zinc die-cast is treated with hair transplantation to suppress excess resonance.<br><br>The unit array is a vertical twin system using wave surface control technology, and all band sound is radiated around the tweeter. In addition, by using a small-diameter twin woofer, voluminous low sound reproduction is realized.<br>The wave surface control technology scientifically clarifies how the wave surface of the sound emitted from each unit spreads and reaches the listener&#39;s ear. It is strictly controlled in four points : &quot;adjusting the energy time response of the woofer and the tweeter on the time axis,&quot; &quot;controlling the directivity of the woofer and the tweeter in all frequency bands,&quot; &quot;matching the electrical phase of the network, etc.,&quot; and &quot;controlling the wave surface diffraction by the baffle shape.&quot;<br><br>A full midship mounting system is adopted to prevent unwanted vibration from each unit from being transmitted to the baffle.<br>The woofer is fixed to the inner baffle inside the enclosure, and the tweeter is fixed from the back side of the baffle through a hair-implanted layer. By mounting the unit outside of the baffle surface, unnecessary vibration of the baffle is reduced.<br>In addition, a floating top that suppresses unnecessary vibration of the top plate and a shield frame that blocks vibration from the frame are adopted. Each unit circuit is also separated in the network mount. In particular, the tweeter circuit is covered with felt from below to eliminate unnecessary vibration from the enclosure.<br><br>The woofer circuit and the tweeter circuit are separated independently, and the signal transmission loss is reduced by crimping wiring.<br>Each element is mounted with careful anti-vibration measures and is laid out so as not to be affected by crosstalk.<br>For input to the network, a radial power supply system is adopted to enable direct and uniform signal transmission.<br><br>The enclosure is plated with high quality walnut real wood and takes advantage of the grain of natural precious wood. In addition, compared to the usual oil finish, the number of polishing is increased and the smoothness is improved.<br>In addition, wool with high sound absorption and excellent sound quality is used as sound absorbing material to reduce unnecessary standing waves in the enclosure.<br><br>It uses a bi-wiring connection terminal that can separately feed the low and high sound circuits.</p>
