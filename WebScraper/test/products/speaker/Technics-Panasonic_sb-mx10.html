				<p class="detail">A three way speaker system that uses TMD (Technics, Monocoque, Diaphragm).<br><br>TMD (Technics Monocoque Diagram) is used for the diaphragm structure of low and middle range.<br>The TMD was designed by repeating several hundred simulations and prototypes using computer vibration analysis developed by NASA. In this structure, the cone part and center cap part, which were separate pieces in the conventional cone type, are integrated. In addition, by adopting a unique shape selected from computer simulation, the rigidity is dramatically improved. As a result, coupled with the joint drive by the coupling cone, the piston motion range is expanded to twice that of the conventional cone type.<br><br>A 32 cm cone woofer with TMD is installed in the low range.<br>The vibration plate of this unit has two layers of pure cross carbon to increase its strength, and has a three layer structure with a layer of polyester damping fiber as a lining. This structure realizes a high internal loss as well as a low weight and high rigidity. In particular, linearity and sound rise characteristics under Oire force are improved.<br>In addition, a large strontium ferrite magnet with an outer diameter of 156 mm, a thickness of 20 mm and a weight of 1.4 kg is used for the magnetic circuit, and an aluminum die-cast frame is used for supporting the magnetic circuit. Moreover, the SB-MX10 has a wishbone structure in which the mounting part to the cabinet and the fixing part of the magnetic circuit are directly connected and supported by four pairs of Y-shaped arms to eliminate unnecessary vibration.<br><br>A 12 cm cone type mid-range with TMD is used for the mid-range.<br>The diaphragm of this unit has a two layer structure of pure cross carbon and carbon sheet, and achieves piston motion up to 10 kHz.<br><br>A 2.8 cm flat tweeter is installed in the high range.<br>By using pure mica for the diaphragm, excellent high-frequency characteristics are realized, and by installing a newly developed acoustic equalizer on the front, high-end characteristics are made smoother.<br><br>The network section uses the traditional Technics linear phase network.<br>In addition, the use of metalized polypropylene capacitors increases transparency in the high-frequency range, and the use of large electrolytic capacitors improves sound quality in the low and mid-frequency ranges.<br>In addition, the LC-OFC is wired straight without using a print pattern, and a non-magnetic material is used for the choke coil fastening screw to prevent deterioration of sound quality.<br>By making the network circuit for each unit completely separate and independent design, crosstalk is suppressed and clear separation is obtained.<br><br>The enclosure is reinforced by using the new MCD joint method, which was developed with attention to the Japanese ancient ant-shaped embedded dense image, and the dynamic balanced enclosure in which baffle plate and side plate are always pressed together has been completed.<br>In addition, a 40 mm thick plate is used for the front baffle and appropriate internal reinforcement is provided to prevent unnecessary vibration.</p>
