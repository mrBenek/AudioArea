				<p class="detail">This speaker system was developed with the aim of conveying the impression of music itself.<br><br>A 36 cm cone type woofer is used for the low range. The shape is based on the straight type with concentric ribs, and various know-how such as pulp material, beating method and papermaking method are invested.<br>This woofer is identical to the original model CS-955, and uses network, duct tuning and sound absorption processing to improve bass reproduction.<br><br>A 6.5 cm dome type mid-range is adopted for the mid-range, and the CS-955 mid-range is used as the parent body to expand the piston motion range and improve the transient.<br>The diaphragm is made of lightweight, high-strength pure beryllium, which is supported doubly by a wire suspension made of beryllium copper wire and a center tangential edge.<br>As a result, there is no unnecessary sound radiation from the edge, and the center is maintained even at large amplitude.<br><br>A ribbon type tweeter equivalent to the commercial unit PT-R7A polished PT-R7 is used for the high frequency band.<br>The principle is that a ribbon-shaped vibrating foil is placed in a strong magnetic field and an electric current is applied directly to it to emit sound. The entire diaphragm receives a uniform driving force, so the entire diaphragm vibrates in the same phase, has excellent linearity with respect to signals, and is a nearly ideal electro-acoustic transducer.<br>In addition, because the ribbon diaphragm has a mass of only 9 mg, accurate piston vibration is maintained up to 120 kHz, which is far beyond the audible range.<br><br>The network is being improved by analyzing the results of trial listening by engineers&#39; ears and sublimating them into a technical method of network design.<br>A high-precision condenser and a choke coil for a woofer are installed separately. Through careful examination of the circuit structure, elements, and layout, we strive to achieve low loss and low crosstalk.<br>In addition, a 3-way multi-amplifier terminal is installed to support multi-amplifier system.<br><br>The size of the enclosure is not limited to economic dimensions and is designed to maximize the characteristics of a woofer.<br>High density, high rigidity, and high loss Apiton plywood is used as the material to suppress harmful resonance and strain.<br>In addition, the shape of the duct has been carefully examined so that only the necessary ultra-low frequency components are radiated, and phase disturbance in the middle and low frequencies is suppressed.<br>Finished with natural wood Marble Ebony.</p>
