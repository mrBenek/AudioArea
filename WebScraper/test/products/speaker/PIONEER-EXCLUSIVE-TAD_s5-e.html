				<p class="detail">A speaker system that uses a unit that inherits the design philosophy of Technical Aucio Devices (TAD) and adopts a vertical twin system as a system that draws out the potential of this unit.<br><br>The S5 uses a vertical twin system with a horn at the center and a woofer at the top and bottom.<br>In this system, the acoustic energy of the two woofers is concentrated in the center and coincides with the horn axis, so that the range from low to high frequencies becomes a virtual co-axis centered on the horn, improving the sense of sound localization.<br>In addition, it has excellent horizontal directivity, and the quick response of the woofer gives a crisp low sound.<br><br>Two newly developed 25 cm cone type woofers are installed in the lower range.<br>By combining a magnetic circuit using an alnico magnet with a lightweight vibration system, we have ensured linearity that does not lose balance from low volume to high input. In addition, by thoroughly increasing the initial motion sensitivity of the vibration support system, we have improved the balance at low volume, which was considered difficult in the past.<br>In addition, by combining a special aging cone and a vibration system with good linearity, it is designed to resist changes over time.<br><br>A horn type tweeter combining a driver unit and a wooden horn is mounted in the high range.<br>The driver unit uses a powerful alnico magnetic circuit with a magnetic flux density of 18,000 gauss and a lightweight, high-hardness beryllium diaphragm with a diameter of 4.8 cm.<br>The horn uses a newly developed wood horn to bring out the wide-band characteristics of the driver unit. It is made of Painted maple with excellent sound quality and is finished by hand. It solves the problems of high sensitivity and directional control in the wide band.<br><br>The connection between the network and the unit is directly connected by crimping without using terminals. In particular, the Woofer unit is crimped even to the Kinshi line without using solder. Furthermore, the dedicated circuit is used for each woofer to prevent back-electromotive force interference between the woofers.<br>In addition, oxygen-free copper wires are used for the choke coil and wire cord, and vibration countermeasures are applied to each material and cord to control resonance and noise. In addition, the wiring is also taken into consideration so that crosstalk between elements and wire cords does not adversely affect the wiring. The input to the network is directly and uniformly transmitted by radial power supply system.<br><br>Particular attention has been paid to the material of the enclosure as well. The top plate and baffle plate upper part are made of Birds Eye Maple (maple), the other parts are made of walnut, and oil stain finish is applied.<br>The structure is a tall boy type floor type. The baffle plate has an elliptic curve round baffle with a large arc to reduce sound reflection and diffraction phenomena.<br>In addition, in order to prevent the vibration of each unit from interfering with each other by the baffle and making the sound muddy, all units are firmly fixed by the midship mount. In addition, a shield frame and a floating top are provided to eliminate resonance.<br><br>The speaker terminal supports a bi-wired connection that separates the high-frequency and low-frequency circuits for independent power supply, and is equipped with a short bar so that it can be used as a single speaker terminal.<br><br>The emblem is made of natural precious wood with laser processing.</p>
