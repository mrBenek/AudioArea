				<p class="detail">Tall boy type speaker system using vertical twin system.<br><br>In the vertical twin system with a tweeter in the center and two upper and lower woofers in between, the sound energy of the two woofers matches the axis of the tweeter, so that the sound from low to high range can be heard as if it is centered on the tweeter.<br>As a result, sound field and clear sound localization.<br>In addition, the new technology &quot;Wave Surface Control Technology&quot; developed in the S-1000twin is employed. It scientifically clarifies how the surface of sound spreads, and takes into consideration four points : &quot;Control the woofer and the tweeter on the time axis,&quot; &quot;Control the directivity,&quot; &quot;Control the electrical phase,&quot; and &quot;Control the wave surface diffraction of the baffle.&quot; It adjusts the mounting position of the tweeter.<br>As a result, excellent sound field reproduction and sound image localization have been realized.<br><br>For the low range, it uses 2 18 cm cone type woofers laminated with polymer film on pulp cone which is also used in TAD (Technical Audio Devices) unit.<br>In addition, we have conducted a major review, such as increasing the rigidity of the diaphragm and improving the frame structure. We have also improved the magnetic flux density of the magnetic circuit by approximately 5%.<br>This realizes a low sound with a scale.<br><br>A 2.5 cm ceramic carbon dome tweeter with a W. F. (wave front) director with wave front control technology is adopted for the high frequency range.<br>The energy response with the woofer is controlled on the time axis, and the directivity is controlled by the horn shape.<br>As a result, the wave surface at the listening position of the viewer matches.<br>In addition, a neodymium magnet is used in the magnetic circuit to realize a smaller size and higher density. As a result, it can be mounted in the baffle plate, reducing the influence of sound pressure inside the enclosure.<br>In addition, the junction with the W. F. director is also a floating structure to block unwanted vibration.<br>In addition, the director is molded with a special elastic material that does not generate excessive vibration and absorbs its own vibration as well.<br><br>In order to prevent mutual interference of each unit, the network is distributed separately for the woofer and the tweeter.<br>In addition, the network board for the woofer is floated from the enclosure to reduce the effect of vibrations from the enclosure.<br>In addition, transmission loss is reduced by caulking without using solder and choke coil and cord using OFC wire.<br><br>The enclosure uses a midship mounting method to avoid transmitting excessive vibration of the unit to the baffle.<br>The woofer is fixed to an inner baffle inside the enclosure, and the tweeter is fixed from the back side of the baffle via a spacer.<br>This prevents mutual interference between units and further reduces the occurrence of unnecessary vibration of the baffle.<br>In addition, a 50 mm thick type baffle has been adopted, and by taking a large round treatment, a natural sound field feeling with less diffraction phenomenon is obtained.<br><br>The speaker terminal can be bi-wired.</p>
