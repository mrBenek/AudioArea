				<p class="detail">A series of speaker enclosure technologies, such as the D.A. S. structure, and new technologies are adopted to further enhance the speaker system.<br><br>A direct drive circuit is installed in the network.<br>This technology employs a Big Laminated Orient Core (BLOC) coil instead of a choke coil inserted in series between the woofer and the amplifier to reduce the loss of low-temperature energy and at the same time improve the damping factor. This coil is a closed magnetic circuit type that is less susceptible to external magnetic fields, and has a structure that is less susceptible to vibration because it is about 10 times heavier than conventional coils.<br>In addition, the network is completely separated for the woofer and the squaker / tweeter to suppress mutual interference, and electrolytic capacitors for audio and oxygen-free copper (OFC) wires are used.<br>In addition, we have adopted crimp connection instead of solder connection which causes even slight distortion.<br>By separating the network for the woofer and for the squaker / tweeter and having two input terminals, a by-wire connection is possible, which prevents the back electromotive force generated by the woofer from affecting the tweeter and the squaker.<br><br>DENON&#39;s unique D. A. S. structure enclosure has been adopted to suppress the internal standing wave and eliminate plate vibration. The standing wave is absorbed and diffused by the porous and tapered porous ceramics installed in the sky plate.<br>The frame and cabinet are integrated by a mounting method in which the tweeter is embedded in a 30 mm thick baffle plate. This prevents the noise of the tweeter frame and vibration of the magnetic circuit, and also eliminates the adverse effect on the tweeter caused by back pressure of the woofer.<br>The oval round baffle improves the diffraction effect, and the in-line arrangement of each unit in a vertical line at the center improves sound image localization.<br><br>A 32 cm cone type woofer is used for the low range.<br>By improving the binder and molding method and using a new cross carbon vibration plate with more rigidity, the vocals can be pushed out.<br>A 145 mm diameter strontium magnet is used for the magnetic circuit.<br>The Woofer uses &quot;NEW Super Bath Mount&quot; to fix magnets with thick bolts to 8 aluminum die-cast stays that extend from the frame.<br>By fixing the magnetic circuit firmly, the vibration supporting point of the voice coil becomes clear, and the clearness of the low sound range is improved.<br><br>Uses 12 cm cone type skoker for the middle area.<br>The rigidity of the diaphragm is improved by cross-carbon fiber, and the internal loss is increased by improving the binder to suppress split vibration.<br><br>A 2.5 cm hard dome type tweeter with a new α boron diaphragm is adopted for the high frequency band.<br>The rigidity is increased by fusing boron compound and titanium oxide to duralumin foil by plasma jet method.<br><br>All units are equipped with a non-resonance concept, and the frame is fully vibration-free.<br>It uses a circular shape and reduces the surface area to eliminate the generation of excess sound caused by resonance.<br>In addition, a twin blade screw is used for mounting to the baffle plate, and vibration of the magnetic circuit is reduced by fixing it at a position close to the center of motion (magnetic circuit) as much as possible.<br>In addition, by using an elastic material (elastomer), the Woofer reduces the reflection of sound from the edge and brakes the frame resonance, and the Skoker / Tweeter brakes the resonance between the protective metal net and the frame.</p>
