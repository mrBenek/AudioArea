				<p class="detail">This is a speaker system developed with Havez technology as a speaker that inherits the design philosophy of HL5.<br><br>For the low range, we have adopted a 20 cm cone type woofer using RADIAL cone which was completed after repeated trial and error through technical exchange with material manufacturers and university laboratories since the 90&#39;s.<br>This unit adjusts the amount of aluminum while taking advantage of the advantages of polypropylene. Moreover, by changing the blend from the center to the periphery of the diaphragm, various problems that occur on the surface of the cone in the middle and low band and middle and high band are reduced.<br>Harvez has introduced high-precision molding equipment for the production of this cone and is focusing on the development of driver units with physical properties superior to those of ordinary vacuum molded polypropylene cones. Has achieved units with excellent characteristics.<br><br>A 2.5 cm diameter aluminum hard dome type tweeter is used for the high frequency band.<br>Ferrofluid cooling treatment is applied so that sound does not collapse even at high temperature. It is a custom-made model by SEAS based on Havez specifications in order to support a wide range of digital sources.<br><br>The Super HL5 is equipped with a super tweeter for the first time in the history of the HL family.<br>The unit is a 2 cm hard dome type super tweeter with titanium diaphragm, and the resolution and air feeling are improved by receiving the high frequency of 10 khz or more.<br>In addition, a neodymium magnet is used for the magnetic circuit.<br><br>The crossover network is designed by Alan Shaw with a computer grade board and other carefully selected minimal parts, and the circuit is mounted after computer testing and listening.<br>The speaker terminal supports a banana plug for bi-wiring connection.<br><br>In order to realize the &quot;Havez sound&quot;, the enclosure design employs the Super Tuned Structure technology, which eliminates unwanted resonance in the mid-frequency range from the material by tuning the mass and compliance of the material, and tunes the material by computer analysis so that very thin material can respond quickly to the sound energy.<br>In addition, by using high hardness and thin materials with different resonance and stiffness, and by using a unique approach to adjust the overall tone while damping with a tar-based material with multiple layers of these materials, unnecessary resonance is damped at high speed by the physical properties of the material itself and its combination, rather than being suppressed by weight and rigidity.<br>The edge of the front baffle is rounded to reduce acoustic diffraction, and the front baffle groove is embedded with a Jersey grill to enhance enclosure integration and reduce the impact on sound quality with SuperGrille.<br>It is finished with cherry finish.<br><br>A special speaker stand is sold separately.</p>
