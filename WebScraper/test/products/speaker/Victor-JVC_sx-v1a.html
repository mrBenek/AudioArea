				<p class="detail">This speaker system is an improved version of the SX-V1.<br><br>A speaker system made with new technologies such as a uniframe baffle board with a solid wood mahogany cabinet and a brass diecast board.<br><br>A 14.5 cm cone woofer is installed in the low range.<br>This unit uses a cone made by Kurt Mueller, and is driven by an internal magnetic alnico magnetic circuit to achieve a solid energy balance in the fundamental band. In addition, the newly shaped spider suspension is integrated with the diaphragm and voice coil to enhance the ability to reproduce minute signals.<br>The unit housing is made of high rigidity is used for the unit housing to reduce electric, magnetic and mechanical strain and improve S/N for audibility.<br><br>A 2.5 cm soft dome type tweeter is installed in the high range.<br>The diaphragm is made of a habutae silk soft dome with excellent directional characteristics and small input rise. It is integrated with the baffle through a 2.5 mm thick brass base place. This is strongly driven by the alnico magnetic circuit of the pot yoke. The pole piece is made of low-carbon steel and is annealed to improve sound stickiness.<br>In addition, a short horn type focusing director has been adopted to achieve a clear sound image and a sound field with a sense of spaciousness.<br><br>A film condenser and air-core coil are used in the network section.<br><br>The input terminal uses a gold plated terminal for banana plug, and rigidity is increased by mounting directly to the cabinet.<br><br>A uniframe baffle is used for the baffle board. By attaching the tweeter and woofer directly to the metal baffle board as close as possible, the sound image is unified.<br>The baffle board is made of a brass diecast board with high rigidity and excellent damping sound, and the ribs for resonance dispersion and brass end pins at the front bottom of the baffle board greatly improve the perceived S/N and sound image density.<br>In addition, the sub-baffle is made of high-density coniferous wood to stabilize the low pitch and improve the sense of springiness.<br><br>The cabinet is made of pure, beautiful sounding mahogany. After assembly, it is impregnated with a newly developed resin to resolve the aging characteristic of solid wood.<br>In addition, all edges are rounded to create a flush surface that suppresses the diffraction phenomenon of sound waves and reduces the turbidity of the sound field. In addition, by carefully polishing the surface using Victor&#39;s traditional woodworking technology, the bonded surface is made flat and brings out the beauty of the grain of wood.<br><br>There was a special speaker stand sold separately.<br>Like the SX-V1, this stand is made of resin-impregnated pure mahogany and uses a 3-point support system in which unnecessary vibration is grounded by the weight at the base of the stand through the support.</p>
