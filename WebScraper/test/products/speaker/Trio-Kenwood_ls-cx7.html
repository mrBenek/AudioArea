				<p class="detail">A compact speaker system with point sound and a sense of localization and sound field that is unique to compact speakers.<br><br>A 19 cm cone type woofer is installed in the low range.<br>The diaphragm is made of reinforced polypropylene with well-balanced internal loss and rigidity. The diaphragm shape is made of a paracurve cone to suppress resonance in shape. In addition, a damping material is coated on the outer periphery of the back surface of the diaphragm to prevent resonance and flatten the characteristics.<br>In addition, by adopting a large φ 120 mm AFC (Advanced Feed Constellation) damper, miniaturization and high reliability have been achieved in a large amplitude speaker unit.<br><br>The high frequency band is equipped with a 2.5 cm soft dome type tweeter that adopts neodymium magnet for magnetic circuit.<br>Neodymium magnets are mainly composed of rare earth elements neodymium and iron / boron. The maximum energy product, which is an indication of the characteristics of the magnet, is 9 times larger than that of ferrite magnets. Therefore, while being small in size, strong energy is obtained.<br>In addition, in order to realize the directivity of the unit, wide band and low distortion, a magnetic fluid (Ferrofluid) is adopted. The magnetic fluid developed by NASA is a liquid containing extremely small magnetic particles (magnetite) with an average diameter of 100 angstrom. Although it is liquid, it is fully magnetized in the magnetic circuit and does not flow out due to gravity or vibration. By filling the gap of the magnetic circuit with this, Q is lowered due to the damping effect due to viscosity, impedance of the lowest resonance frequency fo is flattened, low-frequency dubbing is realized, and distortion is reduced. In addition, the voice coil is stabilized in the center of the gap by the centering effect of the magnetic fluid, and second and third harmonic distortion is reduced by the synergistic effect with the damping effect.<br><br>The tweeter is made into a horizontally long rectangular unit shape miniaturized by a neodymium magnet, and the woofer frame is designed into the smallest shape with only the fixed part of the unit being stretched out, so that the interval between the units is minimized and ignition is achieved.<br><br>It is a magnetic shielding design, and there is no adverse effect on the side of CRT, etc.<br><br>The network section uses Ritz pattern printed circuit boards, German-made film capacitors, and extra-thick OFC material coils for high-quality transmission.<br><br>High-rigidity NF ceramics cabinet is adopted for the cabinet.<br>NF ceramics is a ceramic that is formed by chemical bonding using water as a medium without the need for baking treatment in conventional ceramic manufacturing processes. It is composed mainly of lime, silica, etc., and by chemical bonding, high-quality fillers (aggregates) are wrapped in a bonding material with very few defects. It has high damping properties, elastic modulus, and rigidity.<br>By using this NF ceramics, the frequency band of radiated sound other than direct radiated sound is narrower and the radiation time is shorter than conventional materials, and a high S / N ratio is obtained without coloring music signals.<br>In addition, a round baffle is adopted to suppress the diffraction phenomenon of sound, and a rear duct is adopted for the bass reflex duct.<br>The finish is a veneer finish with urethane resin coating.<br><br>Voice coil directly connected chamber is adopted.<br><br>Gold plated input terminal corresponding to banana terminal is adopted.<br><br>Separately sold speaker stand for LS-CX7 is available.<br>The same NF ceramics as the LS-CX7 body is used for the top and bottom, and the energy radiated from the speaker is received without any coloring.<br>In addition, we have adopted a natural wood core material with a group (also used as a channel for speaker cable) on the back to prevent surface waves from coming around, and a ripple design molding that does not transmit floor resonance, centered on a strut with a thrust plate finish.<br>In addition, a fixing bolt is attached to clarify the vibration earth by integrating with the speaker body.</p>
