				<p class="detail">This is a 2-way speaker system that condensed Onkyo&#39;s new generation bookshelf technology into a compact size.<br><br>A 10 cm cone type woofer with A-OMF Monocoque cone is mounted in the low range.<br>The vibration plate of this unit has a unique bowl shape with no inflection point that is integrally molded up to the center cap. This reduces split vibration, which causes muddy sound. In order to take advantage of this shape, the vibration plate is hybrid molded using PEN, natural fiber and aramid fiber with high rigidity and very low natural sound. In addition, the vibration plate is made of twill PEN. As a result, the strength is improved by 40% compared to the conventional one, and the vibration plate as a whole is reduced by 30%.<br>We are also working to improve the quality of our speakers by applying the know-how we have accumulated through the development of speakers such as a large 38 mm voice coil, a large magnetic circuit, a damper with superior vertical symmetry and response, and a frame with a shape that prevents unnecessary sound emission.<br><br>A ring type tweeter using a ring type diaphragm with an outer diameter of 30 mm and an inner diameter of 18 mm is mounted in the high range.<br>The ring diaphragm is driven by a 25 mm diameter voice coil arranged on the same axis as the ring diaphragm, resulting in a balanced drive structure that minimizes the span from the drive point to the end of the diaphragm. This suppresses split vibration of the diaphragm and realizes excellent high-frequency reproduction.<br>In addition, the EQ that fixes the diaphragm is a Shinkai type that can reproduce ultra-high frequencies up to 100 kHz with flatter frequency characteristics. In addition, the sound quality is improved by taking thorough noise reduction measures such as preventing unwanted sound from being reflected around the diaphragm.<br><br>In the network section, an S. G. L. (Steady Ground Level) type one point concentrated circuit is adopted to prevent ground fluctuation, which is the reference of audio signals.<br>In addition, parts such as a film condenser made by WIMA of Germany are used for the network element, and a gold-plated screw type is used for the terminal that can hold cables with a large core diameter.<br><br>The enclosure is made of thick material for balanced resonance control, and the corners of the baffle face are rounded to prevent unwanted sound from being diffracted.<br>In addition, instead of the conventional circular duct, a unique slit-type &quot;Advanced Aero Acoustic Drive&quot; has been adopted. By adopting a long and narrow rectangular cross section, not only can unwanted high-order noise components be attenuated, but also the viscous resistance of the air is advantageous, improving the sense of volume and speed in the low range. In addition, by separating the cabinet and duct sections, the influence of vibration on each other is suppressed.<br>The baffle and top surface are finished with matte black, and the side surface is finished with real wood veneer.</p>
