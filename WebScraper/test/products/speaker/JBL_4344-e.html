				<p class="detail">A speaker system developed as a successor to the 4343B.<br><br>The 4344 differs from the units used between 1982 and the first half of 1983 and after 1983.<br>Mid - and high-range driver units use 2421B for the first period and 2425J for the second period, and high-range horn type tweeters use 2405 for the first period and 2405H for the second period.<br><br>It is equipped with a 38 cm cone type woofer 2235H in the low range.<br>This unit adopts the basic design common to 2234H, such as SFG magnetic circuit with low distortion factor, strong cone with high compliance edge, long voice coil with winding width of 19 mm, and reinforced suspension, and realizes low distortion factor and high input resistant characteristics.<br>In addition, a mass control ring is added to the vibration system of the 2235H, which lowers fo and increases the rigidity of the vibration system base, and the low-end regenerative capability is further expanded than that of the 2234H.<br><br>It is equipped with 2122H which is a 25 cm cone type mid-woofer in the middle and low range.<br>This unit has a low free air resonance of 35 35 Hz, it is possible to obtain extended low-frequency characteristics in a small-volume cavity. Moreover, since the increase in impedance is small, it is possible to accurately cross over even at low frequencies. Moreover, the breakup distortion outside the operating band is also very small.<br><br>The mid-range area is equipped with a horn type mid-range that combines an acoustic lens 2308, horn 2307 and driver unit.<br>As for drivers, Driver 2421B with improved high-frequency characteristics was used in the previous term.<br>The Screwdriver 2425J, which was adopted in the later stage, uses a pneumatic molded pure titanium diaphragm to obtain smooth wide response and high reliability. Pure titanium has the advantage that it can be used semi-permanently as long as it is not overdriven. In addition, it is combined with JBL&#39;s unique diamond suspension and pure silver impedance control ring to obtain excellent quality and high output up to the high end. In addition, J at the end of the model number is the notation of the impedance type, and 2425J is 16 Ω type.<br>The 2308/2307 is a horn lens to be used in combination with a driver with a throat diameter of 2.5 cm. It has the same performance as the 2311/2308 except for the difference in the suitable driver. The mounting dimensions to the baffle and the crossover frequency are also the same. When this horn / lens is mounted on a baffle 30 cm wide x 30 cm high or more, the directivity of horizontal 80 ° x vertical 45 ° is obtained.<br>Slant Plate 2308 is secured to the front of the baffle by the provided Velcro tape.<br><br>A horn type tweeter is installed in the high frequency range.<br>The units used are 2405 for the former period and 2405H for the latter period. This horn tweeter was developed for wide-range studio monitors. While inheriting JBL&#39;s high-efficiency and high-input-resistance characteristics, it realizes linear response up to 21.5 kHz and directivity of 140 ° horizontal x 40 ° vertical (10 kHz).<br><br>While the 4345 is designed to be bi-amp-driven for real value, the 4344 is designed to be fully powered by an internal network.<br><br>The enclosure is designed for vertical use and has a symmetrical unit layout.<br>Depending on the distance between the two systems and the shape of the room, you are free to decide whether the left and right tweeters are outside or inside.</p>
