				<p class="detail">This speaker system was developed by putting all of the Zero philosophy and technology to expand the frequency range and dynamic range with the aim of wider and more dynamic music playback.<br><br>In order to realize light weight, high rigidity, and wide pistic motion, we have adopted a diaphragm made of fine ceramics, which has the hardness second to that of diamond and is physically and scientifically stable, for three units of low, middle, and high frequency.<br><br>A 32 cm woofer with fine ceramic cone is used for the low range.<br>The fine ceramic diaphragm made of aluminum cone increases the high-frequency resonance up to 3 kHz, which was limited to 800 Hz in the paper cone. This allows sufficient allowance for the 500 Hz crossover to achieve pistic motion in all operating bands.<br>In addition, since the apex angle of the cone is too shallow for paper, the shape effect (fluctuation of frequency characteristics due to the concave of the cone) can be ignored. At the same time, the merits of the cone type, which hardly causes rolling phenomenon, are maintained.<br>In addition, harmful unnecessary noise from the edge part is suppressed by the sealed edge structure, and the large 156 mm diameter and 23 mm thick strontium ferrite magnet is adopted for the magnetic circuit. Combined with the edge wound voice coil with high space factor, excellent driving force and linearity are obtained.<br><br>7.5 cm fine ceramic dome type skoker is adopted for the middle area.<br>The magnetic circuit uses a huge strontium ferrite magnet of the same size as the woofer, and the diameter of the center pole is the same as the woofer.<br>In addition, it is designed with an emphasis on smooth connection with the woofer. The diaphragm is a deep draw-molded, light-weight, high-rigidity fine ceramic dome diaphragm, which is close to a hemisphere. This realizes a wide range of pistic motion from 200 hz to 14 khz over the 500 hz to 5 khz band.<br><br>A dome tweeter made of 3.5 cm fine ceramic is used for the high frequency band.<br>The fine ceramic layer is 2 μ m thick, which is less than one tenth the thickness of Woofer and Skorker, and is made by PVD (physical vapor deposition) method. In addition, an aluminum ribbon edge-wound voice coil is directly connected to the dome without bobbin.<br>In addition, a tangential edge with low amplitude distortion and a magnetic circuit with a high magnetic flux density of up to 19,500 gauss provide sufficient allowance.<br><br>For ultra-high frequencies, we have adopted a dynaflat ribbon super tweeter in which a ribbon-like voice coil fused to a heat-resistant polyimide resin film directly drives air.<br>The base film is made as thin as possible to extend the frequency response, and the voice coil and peripheral support are strengthened to improve the input resistance.<br>We have also improved the lead wire extraction and the shape of the front horn to obtain a smooth response of up to 100 kHz, radiant energy and a wide dynamic range.<br><br>The enclosure uses a highly curved super elliptical baffle to prevent adverse diffraction effects. The front baffle is molded from a special UG resin material with excellent acoustic properties and has strong reinforcing ribs based on modal analysis.<br>In addition, the enclosure as a whole has been comprehensively examined to reduce internal standing waves and back pressure applied to the diaphragm, suppress unnecessary vibration, clarify the vibration support point of the unit, and strengthen the strength and center of gravity of the cabinet as a whole. The sound is determined by a number of know-how based on the results of modal analysis, such as the back board made of high-density casting material, the joint bar to strengthen the connection between the woofer unit and baffle board, and the cabinet.<br><br>The network is a low-loss, high-resistance input dividing network, and uses OFC wiring material with special twist structure.<br>In addition, a level control is mounted on the side panel.</p>
