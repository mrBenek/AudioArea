				<p class="detail">This sound reflector was developed as a full-fledged AV speaker, not as a conventional AV speaker, based on TEAC&#39;s unique technology of large vibrating plate and enclosure-less structure.<br><br>Typical audio speakers have been developed to have flat characteristics when measured without a classroom, and when installed in a listening room, they have large peaks and valleys.<br>However, in an actual concert hall, when measured at the seat of the audience, reflected sound from walls and ceilings interferes with each other, resulting in complicated acoustic characteristics with fine mountains and valleys becoming dense. This creates a hall tone called a scattered wave sound field.<br>In the S-2001, it is very difficult to reproduce this hall tone with a speaker with flat characteristics. Therefore, it was developed based on the reverse idea that a speaker with characteristics similar to those of a concert hall should be created from the beginning.<br><br>The unit consists of a thin baffle at the top, a cone-type tweeter in the center, and a polymer-based diaphragm (63cmx35cm), which is completely fixed to the surrounding frame to control the natural vibration of the rectangular plate and to realize natural hall tone without coloring or peculiarity.<br>In addition, the voice coil bobbin of the driver is made of ポリアミィディド that can withstand high temperatures of 200 ℃, the surface treatment of the diaphragm with a combination of special plastic coating and Japanese paper, and the position of the driver is determined by computer analysis. Through various techniques and thorough trial listening, realistic sound quality is obtained.<br><br>The enclosure-less structure enables realistic sound reproduction with sharp rise and good sound separation.<br>In addition, the balance between the reflected sound and the main sound is thoroughly pursued, and lines and other sounds are clearly reproduced in a rich mid-range.<br>The large diaphragm (54 cm diameter in general cone type) enables rich bass reproduction.<br>In addition, the enclosure-less structure ensures that the sound profile is not lost even during low-frequency boosting.<br><br>It is a high-efficiency design that can reproduce even with a small output amplifier.<br><br>Thin and lightweight design allows for not only floor placement but also hanging installation.<br><br>There are 3 color variations of brown, ivory and black.</p>
