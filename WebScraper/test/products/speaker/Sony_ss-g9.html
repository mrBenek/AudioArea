				<p class="detail">This is the top class speaker system among the G series released by SONY.<br><br>A plum-in-line method is used to clarify the position of the sound source. In this method, units are arranged in a vertical row in order to align the sound source to the front, back, left and right, and a woofer, which tends to be located in the rear, is placed in the front.<br>In addition, the mid-high and tweeter units are arranged on a single unit board. This makes the units closer to each other and improves vertical directivity.<br><br>The baffle board with numerous longitudinal and transverse grooves on the surface, which is also a feature of the G series, is called an equatorial grooved board (AG board). It has a diffuse effect that disperses high-energy frequencies. For example, it prevents middle-and-high sound with relatively short wavelengths from being reflected here and from interfering directly with waves to make specific frequencies sharp.<br>In addition, the enclosure is designed to disperse plate vibration by means of internal reinforcement to avoid overlapping of specific frequencies, thus reducing the box rumbling phenomenon.<br><br>The shape of the cone paper is designed using NASTRAN.<br><br>A 38 cm cone type woofer with CARBOCON is installed in the low range.<br>The magnetic circuit of this unit weighs as much as 7.8 kg. The magnetic flux density is 10800 gauss by Alnico V magnet. In addition, radial slits are inserted in the pole and yoke of the magnetic circuit to cut off the eddy current near the voice coil to suppress distortion and loss. Many other improvements have been made to reduce the sense of distortion.<br><br>A 20 cm cone type midbus unit is installed in the middle and low range.<br>This unit uses a magnetic circuit with a magnetic flux density of up to 10,000 Gauss to drive a large diameter voice coil with a diameter of 75 mm. The structure of the magnetic circuit is similar to that of the Woofer and well reproduces the important band from 300 Hz to 1200 Hz.<br><br>Equipped with 8 cm balanced drive mid-high unit for middle and high range.<br>This unit is designed so that the driving conditions of the inner and outer sides of the voice coil are equal, so that both expansion of the piston motion area and securing sufficient sound pressure energy are compatible.<br>A magnetic circuit of up to 14,200 gauss is also used.<br><br>A 3.5 cm balanced drive type tweeter is installed in the high range.<br>The diaphragm is made of 20 μ m titanium foil molded into a balanced drive shape by an integrated deep drawing method. Moreover, the diaphragm surface is coated with a special high-rigidity material. Combined with a magnetic circuit of 18000 gauss, the piston motion band has been expanded to more than 20000 hz.<br><br>High-grade film capacitors are fully used in the network section. In addition, to prevent capacitors and inductors from causing mechanical resonance and adversely affecting signal transmission, SBMC, an acoustic material with high rigidity and low resonance, is firmly and high-pressure molded.<br>In addition, to reduce signal transmission loss, high-purity oxygen-free copper is used for the wire. This wire consists of 58 wires of 0.18 mm diameter with urethane coating applied to each wire.<br><br>Equipped with multi-input terminal.<br>This terminal prevents signal degradation due to electromagnetic induction and poor contact by securely tightening the contact part with a total of 27 screws.</p>
