				<p class="detail">This 3-way speaker system uses a honeycomb flat diaphragm to respond to the digital audio age.<br><br>Each speaker unit uses a honeycomb flat diaphragm that is light and highly rigid.<br>This diaphragm has a planar structure using an aluminum alloy-made honeycomb structure in order to obtain accurate piston motion while eliminating air resonance (front chamber effect) generated in the cavity in front of the cone of a cone-type speaker. Rigidity is 1,000 to 1500 times that of a paper cone. There is no distortion due to deformation caused by Dainyu force, or characteristic degradation due to aging or temperature change.<br>In addition, in order to solve the problem that a part that does not move at all (= node) at a specific frequency occurs when the center of the flat diaphragm is driven, we have adopted a node drive that drives by connecting a voice coil to the node. In addition, in order to cope with the problem that the appearance of nodes differs depending on the shape and frequency of the diaphragm, we have developed a unique axisymmetric honeycomb that increases the density of the honeycomb toward the center. By eliminating the difference in strength between the left and right sides, the node is made into a perfect circle, and node drive with one circular voice coil is possible.<br><br>A 25 cm honeycomb planar woofer is installed in the low range.<br>This unit uses a large magnet with a diameter of 145 mm and a weight of 1 kg, which is comparable to that of conventional 35 cm class units. The voice coil bobbin is made of laminated polyimide resin film, which hardly deforms even at high temperatures, and the voice coil is made of highly heat-resistant specifications, thereby realizing high input resistance that can withstand high temperatures of 250 ℃.<br>In addition, rolling (fluctuation) resistant moltoprene edge is used for the edge.<br><br>Equipped with 8 cm honeycomb planar skoker in the middle area.<br>The Skoker reduces the air gap between the voice coil, yoke, and pole piece to the limit to improve efficiency. The voice coil bobbin is made of polyimide film similar to Woofer, and the voice coil is heat-resistant to increase input resistance.<br>In addition, light and strong Cross Edge is used for the edge, and the cavity composed of this edge and edge cover realizes smoother frequency characteristics.<br><br>A 2.8 cm honeycomb plane type tweeter is mounted in the high range.<br>In the magnetic circuit, in addition to the large magnet, the pole piece is made into a cone shape to prevent magnetic saturation, and other unique contrivances are taken into consideration to obtain a high magnetic flux density of 17,500 gauss.<br>In addition, the front of the tweeter is equipped with an equalizer with a special shape to achieve flatter characteristics and improved efficiency.<br>In addition, by filling the gap (magnetic gap) between the voice coil, pole piece and yoke with magnetic fluid, the heat radiation effect is greatly improved and high input resistance is obtained.<br><br>A ferrite core with low loss and low distortion is used for the choke coil core of the network section, and a metallized polyester film capacitor is used for the tweeter circuit to prevent degradation of high-frequency characteristics.<br>In addition, it is equipped with a thermal relay to prevent unit breakage due to excessive input or abnormal signal.<br><br>The enclosure is designed with a bass reflex, and the bass reflex port uses a specially shaped port that is integrally molded.<br>In addition, unnecessary vibration is thoroughly suppressed by computer vibration analysis.</p>
