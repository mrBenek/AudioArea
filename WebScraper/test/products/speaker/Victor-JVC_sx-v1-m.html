				<p class="detail">A speaker system made with new technologies such as a uniframe baffle board with a solid wood mahogany cabinet and a brass diecast board.<br><br>A 14.5 cm cone woofer is installed in the low range.<br>A cone manufactured by Kurt Mueller is used for the diaphragm, and by driving with an internal magnetic alnico magnetic circuit, a solid energy balance in the fundamental band is obtained.<br>In addition, it adopts a new type spider suspension that realizes high precision and high linearity, and realizes high linearity from small amplitude to large amplitude and long stroke response.<br>Non-magnetic stainless steel with high rigidity is used for the unit housing, reducing electric, magnetic and mechanical strain, and improving S/N for audibility.<br><br>A 2.5 cm soft dome type tweeter is installed in the high range.<br>The diaphragm uses a habutae silk soft dome with excellent directional characteristics and rise at minute input. In addition, by adopting a shorthorn shape focusing director, it has time alignment to match the time axis with the woofer and improves directivity. This clarifies the sound image and expands the sound field.<br><br>Uniframe baffle board is used for the front baffle.<br>In this method, the tweeter and woofer are directly attached to the metal baffle board as close as possible to achieve the unification of sound image. The baffle board is made of a brass diecast board with high rigidity and beautiful attenuation sound. In addition, a rib for resonance dispersion is provided on the back side of the board to increase rigidity.<br>In addition, two brass end pins at the bottom of the baffle board provide mechanical grounding, which improves the S/N and sound image density as well as the reproducibility of music at a minute level.<br><br>The cabinet is made of pure, beautiful sounding mahogany, which is impregnated with a newly developed resin after assembly to resolve the aging characteristic of solid wood.<br>The external appearance is a flush surface with rounded edges to suppress the diffraction phenomenon of sound waves and reduce the turbidity of the sound field. In addition, the surface is carefully polished using Victor&#39;s traditional woodworking technology to make the bonded surface flat and bring out the beauty of the wood grain.<br><br>The bottom uses the three pointed base method, and the stability is improved by adding another end pin to the two end pins of the uniframe baffle board.<br><br>The speaker terminals are mounted directly in the cabinet for added strength and are highly reliable gold-plated terminals for banana plugs.<br><br>There was a special speaker stand sold separately.<br>Like the SX-V1, this stand is made of pure mahogany impregnated with resin. Moreover, by connecting directly to the Uniframe, unnecessary vibration is grounded with the weight at the base of the stand through the support column, and natural sound field feeling and stable low-frequency reproduction are realized.</p>
