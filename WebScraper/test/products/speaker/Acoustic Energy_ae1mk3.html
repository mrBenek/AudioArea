				<p class="detail">This speaker system has been fully improved while inheriting the original concept of AE1.<br><br>A 10.5 cm cone type woofer is installed in the low range.<br>In this unit, the metal cone diaphragm has been changed from the straight cone to the カーブドコーン. In addition, the diaphragm has been thinned by 33% by a precision press in which the thicknesses of inside and outside are slightly different. This reduces the mass while increasing the rigidity. In this way, we pursue the propagation speed and non-resonance characteristics of the aluminum alloy diaphragm sandwiched by soft anodic films.<br>The magnetic circuit uses neodymium magnet and 32 mm high power voice coil, and the voice coil bobbin uses tough glass fiber material to eliminate magnetic conductive strain.<br>The frame structure is an open chassis structure with the back of the damper open. By introducing an air pump system with a structure that takes in air directly, the voice coil is cooled without being filled with magnetic fluid. The frame is made of solid and low-loss magnesium die-cast.<br><br>A 3.2 cm soft ring dome type tweeter is installed in the high range.<br>The conventional model was equipped with a metal dome type tweeter, but by changing to a soft ring dome type with a center plug called a wave guide, excellent phase linearity has been obtained.<br>In addition, it is equipped with a large-capacity dual chamber that increases cooling efficiency without magnetic fluid, and realizes a high-voltage magnetic circuit using a neodymium cup magnet and a 32 mm diameter copper-coated aluminum voice coil.<br><br>The network consists of 14 components, including a low-colorization aluminum-based power film resistor, a high-current audio file-grade laminated core low-loss inductor, a high-frequency air-core inductor, and an audio file-grade high-power 400 v polypropylene capacitor. These components use ± 2% precision components and are mounted on a damping platform.<br>In addition, a third order acoustic slope with phase compensation for positive phase coupling between Low/Mid and HF is used, and at the same time, units are connected by silver coated internal wiring material to realize natural connection.<br><br>Each unit is directly attached to a 10 mm thick heavy aluminum alloy baffle with gently rounded openings and edges. This allows the unit to be firmly integrated and reduces the diffraction of sound waves emitted from the unit to obtain naturality.<br>The enclosure is also elaborately designed. The bass reflex port, which was previously placed in the front, has been moved to the rear. The top, bottom, left and right panels are made of 12 mm thick MDF and 5 mm thick steel plate vibration control panels connected with bolts to achieve high rigidity and high specific gravity. In addition, cross braces with tension bolts are placed in the left and right center of the wall surface to suppress resonance.<br><br>There are 2 variations of the external appearance, piano black finish and maple finish.<br>The piano black finish is a 7-layer lacquer finish and the maple is a natural wood veneer finish.<br><br>There was a special speaker stand as an option sold separately.<br>This stand is a heavy-weight stand with four pillars filled with slab grains on a thick glass base.</p>
