				<p class="detail">This is a pre-stage model speaker system in which all of Sony&#39;s technology and know-how have been invested in seeking natural sound and realistic sound reproduction.<br><br>A 30 cm cone type unit is used for the low range.<br>The diaphragm uses unidirectional carbon fiber (unidirection fiber). By radially aligning 56 parts of carbon fiber from the neck part, which is the driving point of the diaphragm, toward the circumference, vibration from the voice coil is transmitted more pure and smoothly to the diaphragm. In addition, the density of carbon fiber increases from the outer circumference to the cone neck part to obtain an ideal strength distribution as a diaphragm.<br>In addition, because it is made into a curved cone shape, the squeal characteristic of carbon is suppressed.<br>The magnetic circuit uses an Alnico oxygen-free copper, which has a conductivity more than 200 times that of ferrite and a low magnetic resistance of about 1/4, and a 24 mm long magnet edge-wise ドボイスコリ.<br>In addition, the frame uses a heavy class MC pound type aluminum die-cast frame with a weight of 4.2 kg and an average thickness of 10 mm to hold it firmly.<br><br>A 6.5 cm dome type unit is adopted for the middle area.<br>It uses a 99.9999% pure SiC fine ceramics diaphragm made of SiC (silicon carbide), which has particularly excellent characteristics among fine ceramics, as solid wood. It fully takes advantage of the advantages of SiC such as excellent thermal conductivity, heat resistance, and propagation speed (12,600m/s pulse echo method), enabling excellent mid-range regeneration.<br>As with the Woofer, it uses a large alnico magnet and a φ 65 mm oxygen-free copper edge-wised voice coil. In addition, the frame uses a special vibration absorbing alloy-made aluminum die-cast frame with 20 times more damping characteristics than ordinary aluminum die-cast frames, a low-distortion magnetic circuit, and a pure copper back chamber.<br><br>A 2.5 cm dome type unit is adopted for the high frequency band.<br>As in the mid-range, SiC fine ceramic diaphragm is adopted, and the band is expanded to 50,000 Hz by excellent propagation characteristics.<br>Alnico magnet is used for the magnetic circuit, and the frame is made of vibration absorbing alloy.<br><br>The network is distributed to prevent electromagnetic interference between circuits and parts as well as between networks of each unit.<br>In addition, carefully selected high-quality parts such as air-core coils with good linearity and metalized polypropylene film capacitors made in Europe are used. In addition, each element is connected without soldering to reduce loss, giving careful consideration to sound quality.<br><br>The speaker terminal is equipped with two systems that can be connected by bi-wiring, and each has its own network for high and low frequencies.<br><br>The enclosure uses an acoustic form that has been tested and tested repeatedly. By taking a unique shape, the sound of the enclosure is converted into a positive element and a more natural sound is sought.<br>Specially laminated plywood is used for the baffle plate, and the diffraction phenomenon of sound is suppressed by adding a large taper to the surface.<br><br>There was a special speaker stand WS-777 sold separately.</p>
