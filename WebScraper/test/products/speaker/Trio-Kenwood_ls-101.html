				<p class="detail">A bookshelf type speaker system developed with the aim of reproducing high fidelity musical quality.<br><br>A 25 cm cone type woofer is installed in the low range.<br>In order to improve the frequency characteristics in the mid - and high-frequency range, this unit uses a diaphragm made of corn paper made of Canadian kraft pulp and coated with titanium oxide to obtain excellent transient characteristics. This diaphragm is supported by a non-directional urethane edge of fibers to eliminate disturbance of transient characteristics due to amplitude distortion in the low-frequency range and inverse resonance of the edge.<br>The magnetic circuit uses a magnet with a diameter of 120 mm and a long voice coil with a stroke of 16 mm. The voice coil does not come out of the magnetic circuit even at large amplitude, making it possible to play music without distortion.<br>A non-resonance chamber with a thick cloth substrate is used for the chamber, and while suppressing abnormal resonance in the high-frequency range, it has strength in the low-frequency range at the time of large amplitude. In addition, a short ring is used for the pole piece, and the strain of more than 500 Hz at which the woofer begins to increase impedance is eliminated.<br><br>The middle area is equipped with a 12 cm special cone structure is mounted in the middle area.<br>CF pulp is used as the base material for the cone paper and a special manufacturing method that is light and strong is adopted. This manufacturing method takes a larger mold clearance (gap) than the conventional press method, and reduces the press pressure applied to the cone paper to complete the light and strong cone paper. In addition, the dome part requires ideal characteristics such as strength in the low frequency range and sound dispersion in the high frequency range. By using a thick cloth coated with rubber three times and having no dome deformation against amplitude in the low frequency range and excellent characteristics in the high frequency range, wide-band characteristics from 200 Hz to 10,000 Hz are obtained.<br>The Scoker damper has also been reconsidered. In order to move the resonance frequency of the damper to the higher side while maintaining sufficient strength against amplitude, the shape of the damper is S-shaped like the one used at the edge and the damper width is reduced.<br>The air chamber of the dome part acts as a compliance component at the time of amplitude in the low range and causes the low range distortion. In order to prevent this, a 10 mm hole is provided in the pole piece to let the compliance component generated in the dome part escape to the back of the magnet.<br>The frame has a die-cast finish.<br><br>A 5 cm cone type tweeter is installed in the high range.<br>In this unit, the upper limit of the reproduction frequency is raised by reducing the angle of the neck part of the cone paper, and the dead weight of the cone paper is reduced to 0.1g. In addition, by removing the damper and reducing the distance between the voice coil and the neck of the cone paper as much as possible, a high-efficiency tweeter with excellent start-up characteristics and sharp sharpness is realized.<br>A die-cast frame is used for the frame to eliminate resonance of the frame and sound fog.<br><br>In the network section, a large ferrite core coil with low DC resistance of 3 mH and 0.40 Ω is used for the coil connected in series with the woofer. A large metalized ドペーパー capacitor with 20 μ F is used for the capacitor connected in series with the squaker. The coil with low loss is effective for improving damping, and the large capacitor with good distortion characteristics is effective for smooth sound music playback.<br><br>All of the baffle plate, back plate, side plate, and roof plate of the enclosure use a single laminated lumber core. The lumber core as a core material and the single plates as both side plates take advantage of each other&#39;s physical properties to form an enclosure with high Young&#39;s modulus and excellent vibration damping rate.<br>As for internal reinforcement, we have designed the enclosure so that the resonance Q of the enclosure is low, rather than increasing the number of reinforcement materials. Specifically, a flexible board is attached to the top plate, a reinforcing rod is attached to the back side of the baffle plate, and a Woofer plate is attached to the back plate.</p>
