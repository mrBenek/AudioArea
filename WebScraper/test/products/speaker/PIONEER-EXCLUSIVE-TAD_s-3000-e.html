				<p class="detail">In this speaker system, the performance of the unit is improved by &quot;driving a lightweight and highly rigid diaphragm with a magnetic circuit with a high magnetic flux density&quot;, and &quot;eliminating resonance of the whole system&quot; is thoroughly pursued.<br>The basic and new technologies developed through the development of TAD (Technical Audio Devices) units have been applied and completed.<br><br>Uses a full midship mount that supports all units except for the baffle.<br>The Woofer, which generates the largest vibration, is firmly fixed with an aluminum die-cast frame on the enclosure base (bottom plate), which is made by sandwiching a 2.5 mm thick steel plate between two sheets of highly rigid Apiton plywood.<br>In addition, the Mid-range and Tweeter have firmly fixed the rear part of the magnetic circuit to an inner baffle made of Apiton PCB, a high-density conifer particle board sandwiched by Apiton plates.<br>This full-midship mount dramatically reduces the interference of each unit creating an enclosure structure that draws out the original sound of each unit.<br><br>Furthermore, in order to thoroughly implement the basic concept of &quot;eliminating excessive sound,&quot; we have introduced a non-resonance technology for the entire system.<br>The baffle plate, back plate, and top plate are combined with high-density conifer particle boards with different densities each other to increase the rigidity of the entire enclosure. Also, the magnetic the woofer, mid-range and tweeter is plated with copper to disperse resonance points and greatly reduce unnecessary vibration of the unit.<br>In addition, anti-vibration materials are interposed between the circuit board and cabinet and between the circuit board and each element to eliminate distortion caused by minute vibration of network parts.<br><br>A 30 cm cone shaped woofer is used for the low range.<br>The large diameter strontium ferrite magnet of φ 165x24mm realizes a high magnetic flux density of 14000 Gauss. In addition, the magnetic circuit is copper-plated to reduce magnetic distortion, resulting in pure sound quality.<br>The diaphragm uses a new material, New Embedded Carbon Graphite in a new curved shape to further improve acoustic characteristics.<br>In addition, technologies such as the adoption of linear drive magnetic circuit (LDMC) to suppress the amplitude distortion of voice coil have been introduced.<br><br>A 6.5 cm dome type skoker is used for the middle area.<br>It uses a magnetic circuit that realizes a magnetic flux density of 16000 Gauss with a φ 156x17mm strontium ferrite magnet.<br>Moreover, copper plating is applied to the iron material to reduce magnetic strain.<br>Ceramic graphite is used for the diaphragm, and excellent sound quality is realized by combination of tangential edge and edge-wise voice coil.<br><br>A 2.5 cm dome type tweeter is used for the high frequency band.<br>The magnetic circuit uses a strontium ferrite magnet of φ 85x20mm to realize a magnetic flux density of 20000 gauss. In addition, copper plating is applied to suppress magnetic distortion.<br>The diaphragm uses newly developed ceramic graphite with a purity of 99.99%, which is formed into a ceramic without using any binder or base material from graphite with a crystal structure in which carbon atoms are arranged two dimensionally.<br><br>For the network, in addition to the element arrangement which minimizes the crosstalk of each element, the circuit structure, element and layout such as the caulking wiring which does not use solder are carefully examined to ensure low loss and low crosstalk.<br><br>The non-resonance concept is also incorporated into the separately sold dedicated speaker base, and the speaker base CP-3000 adopts a layered structure of high-density Apiton PCB almost equivalent to the S-3000.<br>In addition, the new moral development in the installed state is greatly improved, because it can be used firmly and directly connected with the S-3000 midship mount by the strong hexagon head bolt.</p>
