				<p class="detail">A 3-way speaker system that thoroughly pursues the idea that only the diaphragm vibrates.<br><br>The enclosure has a superbus mounting structure.<br>This structure consists of an aluminum die-cast frame and a magnetic circuit. The body of the woofer is firmly fixed from the front and back of the enclosure. An old steel bolt is used for the lock.<br>As a result, the unit and the enclosure are integrated, and the structure is robust to large instantaneous input. By fixing the magnetic circuit, which can be called the center of gravity of the whole unit, the vibration supporting point of the diaphragm is clarified.<br><br>It uses a unique New D.A. S. structure to shut out standing waves inside the enclosure and eliminate plate vibration.<br>The structure has porous ceramic tapers installed on the top plate on both front and rear sides to improve the diffusion capacity of standing waves. In addition, the porous ceramic absorbs part of the sound wave passed through by heat exchange, reducing the generation of standing waves itself.<br>Furthermore, by adding the weight of porous MIC to the five plates and strengthening the connection between the plates, vibration of the whole plates is suppressed.<br><br>The baffle has a unique R. M. M. structure. The frame and cabinet are integrated by the mounting method in which the tweeter is embedded in the thick baffle plate. This reduces frame displacement caused by the reaction when the diaphragm is driven and also reduces the adverse effect on the トウィーター caused by the back pressure of the woofer.<br><br>A 32 cm cone type woofer is used for the low range.<br>The binder and molding method have been further improved, and new cross carbon for higher rigidity has been adopted, and sharpness in the low sound range has been further improved.<br>The magnetic circuit uses a barium ferrite magnet.<br><br>A 12 cm cone type skoker is used for the middle area.<br>The number of carbon fiber filaments was increased three times to 3000 to improve the synthesis of the diaphragm.<br>In addition, an aluminum die-cast frame rigidly mounted with eight screws and a rigid ceramic back cavity eliminate unwanted resonance.<br><br>A 2.5 cm hard dome type tweeter is used for the high frequency band.<br>The ceramic coated α - boron diaphragm, which is further refined from the α - boron diaphragm, has been adopted to improve the sense of speed in the high range.<br>Boron compound and titanium oxide are deposited by plasma jet method on duralumin foil which is coated with ceramic layer on the back surface of this diaphragm, and the synthesis is further improved than the conventional one.<br><br>The network is divided into two sections, one for the low band, the other for the middle band and the other for the high band, and the other is supplied to each unit.<br>In addition, in order to prevent harmful voltage generation due to coil interference between the speaker&#39;s magnetic circuit and the network circuit, we take into consideration the position of each circuit and use a centralized grounding system to suppress unnecessary signal generation.<br><br>The enclosure is made of high density particle board of coniferous trees with a Bu-lucky wall wood-grain finish.</p>
