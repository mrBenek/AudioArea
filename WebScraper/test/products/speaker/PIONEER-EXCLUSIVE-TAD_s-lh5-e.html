				<p class="detail">This speaker system incorporates TAD (Technical Audio Devices) design know-how and uses a linear power woofer and AFAST-SZ horn tweeter based on the clear &amp; rich concept.<br><br>A 22 cm cone type woofer is used for the low range.<br>This woofer employs a linear power system that eliminates the edge using a unique technology, reducing the unwanted sound emitted by the edge and the negative influence on the cone.<br>In addition to the edge-wise voice coil, which has increased the density of the voice coil and increased the magnetic efficiency, we have applied the know-how developed in the TAD unit to use a cone that has undergone an aging process to tune the sound quality.<br>An aluminum die-cast frame is used to support the unit.<br><br>A horn type tweeter with AFAST (Acoustic Filter Assited System Tuning) technology, which is also used in TAD, is used for the high frequency range.<br>By having a round opening, directivity in all directions is made uniform, and by making the ratio of direct sound and indirect sound appropriate, sound has spread and thickness, and reproducibility with good sharpness is realized.<br>By installing an acoustic tube in the horn wall, the resonance of the horn is absorbed, eliminating the sense of movement of the sound image before and after it.<br>In addition, by matching the aperture size with the woofer, the continuity of directional characteristics, energy, and topological connection are improved, and sound connection including reflected sound and smoothness are improved.<br><br>The driver is a newly developed high-efficiency compression driver that incorporates TAD design know-how.<br>A finely tuned 2.5 slit phasing plug phasing plug and an edge-wise voice coil wound directly into an aluminum diaphragm and integrated beauty bin to eliminate signal conversion losses.<br>In addition, by combining it with the edge made of titanium from which internal strain has been removed by heat treatment, it is possible to reproduce sound with higher purity and superior response.<br><br>Equipped with a Attenuator that can change the high range level, you can choose sound quality suitable for the listening room from 3 positions.<br>In addition to the adoption of filter characteristics that take into consideration the phase characteristics of the woofer and tweeter, the low-frequency and high-frequency substrates are separately arranged to greatly reduce crosstalk at a minute level.<br>The choke coils are made of newly developed air-core coils, carefully selected high-quality capacitors, and wiring materials with special twist structure.<br><br>Uses a fine-tuning enclosure with a light wood-grain 6-side finish.<br><br>Equipped with a large gold-plated input terminal that can be connected to a banana plug.<br><br>There was a special speaker stand sold separately.</p>
