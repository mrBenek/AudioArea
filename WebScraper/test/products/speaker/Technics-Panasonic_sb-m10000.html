				<p class="detail">This floor-type speaker system was developed by taking advantage of our unique new technology and the silence technology cultivated over many years.<br><br>The SB-M10000 uses a Kelton woofer with a passive radiator and a dual dynamic drive system in the low-frequency range, providing excellent low-frequency playback capability.<br>The Kelton Woofer with passive radiator partitions the cabinet into two rooms, with a drive speaker unit on the inner partition plate and a passive radiator on the outer baffle plate. The resonance effect between the air in front of the drive speaker unit and the passive radiator expands the low range and increases the volume.<br>In the dual dynamic drive system, two Kelton-type woofers equipped with passive radiators are placed on the back side and driven in the same window. This reduces unnecessary sound in the cabinet itself and vibration transmission to the floor, resulting in high-quality bass reproduction and orientation.<br><br>Four 27 cm cone passive radiators and four 22 cm cone woofers for drives are installed in the low range.<br>The edge of the woofer unit and passive radiator uses a push-pull edge. The push-pull edge has a unique edge shape in which convex parts and concave parts are alternately arranged into 6 parts. The distortion is reduced by equalizing the air displacement before and after the amplitude.<br>In addition, a newly developed linear magnetic circuit is used for the magnetic circuit of the woofer unit. In this method, the optimum shape of the magnetic circuit plate is obtained by magnetic field analysis, and uniform magnetic flux density distribution and an extremely wide effective magnetic flux range are obtained. This allows the voice coil to operate in a uniform magnetic field at all times and suppresses distortion.<br><br>Two 18 cm cone type mid-low units are installed in the middle and low range.<br>This unit uses a composite mica diaphragm and a peakless diaphragm with a high internal loss material placed around the diaphragm by vibration analysis. The peakless diaphragm greatly reduces peak sound and distortion by suppressing deformation of the diaphragm due to high-frequency resonance.<br>In addition, the same push-pull edge and linear magnetic circuit used in the woofer unit.<br><br>The mid-high area is equipped with a 6 cm dome mid-high unit with an oval cross section.<br>The diaphragm is made of pure mica with high specific elastic modulus and internal loss, and is coated with lacquer. The voice coil is edgewise wound with pure aluminum flat wire, providing excellent response and high-resolution sound quality.<br>Pure mica dome is used for the diaphragm, and excellent high-frequency characteristics are obtained by using a peakless diaphragm.<br><br>A 2.5 cm dome type tweeter is installed in the high range.<br>The diaphragm of this unit is made of super graphite with a sound velocity of 18,800m/sec., which determines the high-frequency characteristics. By using a peakless diaphragm, high-frequency reproduction without distortion is possible.<br>In addition, a neodymium magnet is used for the magnetic circuit, and by optimizing the shape using magnetic field analysis, a magnetic flux density of 20,000 Gauss (2 Tesla), which was difficult with conventional diameters of this class, has been achieved.<br><br>The network parts are made of high-quality parts that have excellent physical characteristics and sound perception.<br>LC-OFC wire is used for the choke coil. A silicon steel core type and a ferrite core type are used separately. In addition, the parts are arranged so as not to receive the induced voltage to the choke coil. Large electrolytic capacitors for acoustic use and high-quality polyester capacitors are used according to the application.<br>Network elements are directly connected by crimping sleeve to reduce transmission loss and distortion due to interposition of dissimilar metals. Internal wiring is also LC-OFC meltone.<br><br>The cabinet is a tall boy type with dual dynamic drive type woofer arranged on top and bottom. The sound field feeling is improved by applying multi-layer coating and adopting a high-rigidity two division structure that eliminates vibration propagation between each unit.<br><br>The input terminal uses cutting brass material with gold plating that can be used with extra thick cords or 4 mm plugs.<br>Two pairs of upper and lower woofer inputs, one pair of mid-low inputs, and one pair of mid-range inputs are provided. The short cord can be used for bi-wiring connection, and two power amplifiers can be used to adjust the balance between the woofer and mid-range inputs according to the size of the room.</p>
