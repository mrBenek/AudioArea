				<p class="detail">This new generation studio monitor was developed by gathering the wisdom and technology of JBL.<br><br>The M9500 adopts a 2-way virtual coaxial layout with a 3-division module structure consisting of two upper and lower woofers and a driver / horn placed between them.<br>The network and exclusive grill were sold separately as an option.<br><br>The enclosure is six sided with a solid MDF material with a gray NEXTEL suede coating finish.<br>In the design, JBL&#39;s unique virtual equivalent tuning method is adopted. By changing the volume of the upper and lower two enclosures and the resonance frequencies of the ducts, low-frequency characteristics that smoothly extend to the low end are realized.<br>In addition, in consideration of placement in a narrow studio, the terminal couple on the back of the speaker is installed at an angle to minimize plug protrusion.<br></p><br><hr>
            <p class="detail"><strong>Low-pass module</strong><br><br>It is equipped with 1400 nd which is 36 cm cone type woofer in the low range.<br>A neodymium magnet is used in the magnetic circuit. With the conventional method, it was difficult to use a neodymium magnet in a woofer because the magnetic force rapidly decreases when the temperature exceeds the 140 degrees. However, this problem was solved by adopting a unique bent gap cooling method. In this method, three through-holes are provided from the gap part to the rear part of the unit, and the voice coil is forcibly cooled by passing an air flow using the reciprocating motion of the woofer cone itself. Therefore, the flow volume of cooling air automatically increases when the amplitude is large and the generation of heat is large.<br>By strengthening the magnetic circuit, we have achieved a top plate width of 25.4 mm in the gap, and by adopting a short voice coil with edgewise winding of a highly flat aluminum ribbon wire, we have achieved quick response speed and large linear motion of the diaphragm.<br><br>The enclosure uses a bass reflex system.<br>The bass reflex port has a 3-inch diameter, and the opening is R treated to smooth the flow of air.<br></p><br><hr>
            <p class="detail"><strong>High pass module</strong><br><br>The high-pass driver unit is equipped with 475 nd.<br>The 475 nd is a refined unit based on 2450J. The magnetic circuit has been changed from an external magnetic type to an internal magnetic type. In addition, the diaphragm has been changed from a ribbed type to a flat dome diaphragm coated with Aqua Plus in consideration of sound quality. The diaphragm diameter is 4 inches (10 cm) and the diamond edge suspension ensures linear operation.<br>It also employs a compression driver design with a traditional inverted dome diaphragm layout and a soundpath configuration that connects to a 2-inch (5 cm) diameter throat via a unique equalizer called a coherent wave phase plug.<br><br>The horn is a biradial horn with a 2-inch diameter throat made of aluminum die cast. It has a cutoff frequency of 500 Hz, a cutoff frequency of approximately 500 Hz, a radiation pattern of 60 degrees horizontally and 40 degrees vertically.<br>The upper and lower parts of the horn body have a NEXTEL finish by cutting out the laminated MDF.<br></p><br><hr>
            <p class="detail"><strong>Other</strong><br><br>The Network M9500X employs a charge-coupled, self-contained system and is housed in a NEXTEL-finished enclosure made of MDF material to eliminate the influence of sound pressure and magnetism inside the speakers.<br>We have also introduced a unique advanced technology that applies a bias voltage (18 v) to the internal elements for class-A operation, improving the overall sound quality, high frequency flexibility, and S/N sensation.<br><br>Dedicated speaker cables and Neutrik NL4 connectors are used for speaker and network wiring.</p>
