				<p class="detail">The LS series speaker system was developed with the aim of producing sound that can express the emotion and emotion of music and the atmosphere of the place where performance is performed.<br><br>In the development of the LS 700, sound quality was pursued after thorough pursuit of physical characteristics.<br>In order to pursue physical characteristics, all data such as frequency characteristics, 30 ° / 60 ° directional characteristics, distortion characteristics, and transient characteristics are strictly controlled.<br>In order to pursue the sound quality that cannot be measured by measuring instruments, we conduct thorough hearings. In addition to taking into consideration Japanese and Western style rooms, the size of the room, the structure of the room, the region, and the climate, more than 60 people, including musicians, critics, sales staff, etc., participated in the hearings of the LS series to emphasize human hearing.<br><br>If the speaker unit is placed on the center line (both vertically and horizontally) of the baffle plate, the characteristics of the medium and high range will deteriorate. Therefore, it is necessary to place the speakers on either the left or right side. However, with conventional speakers, the left and right speakers are biased in the same direction due to a problem in the manufacturing process, and the sound field is also tilted.<br>The LS 700 uses a symmetrical design in pursuit of sound and sound quality to achieve more natural sound and sound.<br><br>A 30 cm cone type woofer is installed in the low range.<br>In the past, it was a principle to increase the mass of the vibration system in order to produce a sense of volume in the low range in a sealed speaker. However, in the LS series such as the LS 700, lightweight cone paper is used. In addition, unique corrugation is added to the cone paper, compliance of dampers and edges is improved, and the material, density, and quantity of the enclosure material and sound absorbing material are adjusted to realize a low-fo woofer with lightweight cone.<br>The cone paper uses CF corn made from Canadian kraft pulp, which has a high Young&#39;s modulus, is lightweight yet has sufficient strength, and contains an appropriate amount of internal loss. In addition, the LS 700 uses CF corn impregnated with a chemical compound called SBR to strengthen the bonds between fibers, resulting in a diaphragm with a high Young&#39;s modulus. In addition, an asymmetric S-shaped edge is used for the edge to prevent changes at large inputs. In addition, a cloth chamber with damping material coating is used to prevent distortion.<br>The magnetic circuit uses a perforated T-shaped pole piece that eliminates current distortion, and a long voice coil with a cross-sectional area twice as large as that of conventional products to achieve sound with less distortion.<br>A die-cast frame is used for the frame to shut out resonance and resonance of the frame itself.<br><br>Equipped with 12 cm cone type skoker in the middle area.<br>This unit has a composite structure. It uses a soft dome directly connected to a 45 φ voice coil for mid-range and high-range applications, and a cone for mid-range and low-range applications. The cone is a CF cone impregnated with SBR, similar to the woofer, to flatten the output sound pressure characteristics and reduce distortion.<br>An S-shaped rubber edge made of synthetic rubber with 90% natural rubber component is used for the edge part, and the distortion of sound is eliminated by the characteristic of rubber with large internal loss and no directivity.<br>The voice coil bobbin is made of TLP paper, which is hard, lightweight, and highly resistant to heat and vibration. This paper improves the transmission capability to the diaphragm, while a strong magnetic circuit improves the transient characteristics.<br><br>A soft dome type tweeter is installed in the high range.<br>The diaphragm is made of thermo-molded silk, which eliminates high-frequency sounds and produces a glossy, soft high-frequency sound. At LS = 700, the soft dome of silk is impregnated with SBR to improve the start-up response to impact sound.<br>A resin-molded equalizer is attached to the T-shaped pole piece to shut out mechanical resonance and loss. In particular, the LS-700 has a well-ventilated equalizer to apply a constant back pressure to the diaphragm, giving rise characteristics with damping.<br>Since the diaphragm is impregnated with SBR for elasticity, there is a slight phase difference between the voice coil and the center. To eliminate this phase difference, an equalizer is installed on the front of the diaphragm.<br><br>A low-distortion copper-silicon laminated coil is used for the woofer of the network, and a metalized polyester capacitor is used for the tweeter to improve the rise of the high-frequency range.<br>The attenuator employs a five step impedance matching type with less impedance variation than the conventional continuously variable type. The LS 700 provides five levels of attenuation in 2 dB steps within ± 5%.<br><br>For the baffle plate, a lumber core made of Muku with high Young&#39;s modulus and a soft single plate are bonded together. The material of the core material and the single plate on both sides make up for the lack of physical properties of each other to improve sound quality. In addition, a flat baffle is adopted and the attenuator is put together in a small size to improve directivity.<br>The exterior is finished by taking advantage of the beautiful wood grain of single board.<br><br>The enclosure is made of Brazilian Rose natural wood which combines acoustic characteristics with luxury.<br><br>A pearl RUNNET jersey is used for the skirt.<br><br>There was a speaker stand sold separately.</p>
