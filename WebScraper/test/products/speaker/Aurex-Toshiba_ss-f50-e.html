				<p class="detail">A speaker system that uses C. R. Polymer (Cell Rigid Polymer), a structure developed by Orex, as a diaphragm.<br><br>C. R. polymer is a special rigid foam. It has a sandwiched structure of soft high-foam (low-density structure) on the inside and hard skin layer (high-density structure) with ebonite on the outside. It has the same internal loss as paper, high rigidity, and light weight.<br>In order to realize wide-band reproduction by taking advantage of the features of this structure, the diaphragm is in the shape of a nebular (nebula), the central part is thick and the peripheral part is thin, and it is in the shape of a convex lens close to a plane, which makes it possible to take sufficient strength in the central part where stress is large. In addition, the smooth shape of the nebular allows sound to be diffused appropriately and improves directivity.<br><br>When the center of the flat diaphragm is driven, a part (node) that does not move at all at a certain frequency appears. This is a kind of resonance phenomenon called split vibration. There is a node drive method that drives the node part as a method to cancel this. However, a general node drive cannot cancel the 8th vibration mode.<br>In order to solve this problem, the C. R. polymer diaphragm employs a triangular truss structure in which the voice coil bobbin that drives the central part of the diaphragm and the outermost periphery of the diaphragm are fixed by a subcone. By this structure, the inner and outer peripheries of the diaphragm are driven simultaneously, suppressing resonance to the extent that it is not practical.<br><br>A 30 cm flat woofer made of C. R. polymer is installed in the low range.<br>It uses a damper made of Conex material and urethane edge with excellent linearity to suppress vibration of the diaphragm. It is also driven with high efficiency by a magnetic circuit made of φ 156 mm ferrite magnet and voice coil made of polyimide bobbin.<br>In addition, the aluminum die-cast frame suppresses unwanted resonance at the time of Dainyu force.<br><br>The mid-range is equipped with a 10 cm flat skoker made of C. R. polymer as well as woofer.<br>Because the Skoker diaphragm is smaller in diameter and thicker than the woofer diaphragm, the ratio of the ebonite layer is increased, which has the highest internal loss between the woofer and the tweeter.<br>A ferrite magnet of φ 100 mm is used for the magnetic circuit, and an aluminum die-cast frame is used for the frame.<br><br>A 3 cm titanium dome type tweeter is installed in the high range.<br>The diaphragm is made of 30 μ - thick titanium foil that is integrally molded with the tangential edge. Compared to ordinary dome-shaped diaphragm, this diaphragm is almost flat. In addition, a precisely designed diffuser is mounted on the front of the diaphragm.<br>Uses a φ 70 mm magnet for the magnetic circuit.<br><br>In the network section, metalized polyester film capacitors with low distortion design are used for the tweeter and squaker, and electrolytic capacitors with good sound attenuation are used for the woofer to achieve low loss and low distortion.<br><br>25t baffle plate and 20t particle board are used for other parts.<br><br>There was a speaker stand (115 mm height) sold separately.</p>
