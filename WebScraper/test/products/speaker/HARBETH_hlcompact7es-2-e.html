				<p class="detail">While inheriting the musicality of HL Compact and HL Compact 7, this speaker system was refined by technical exchange with engineers of BBC.<br><br>A 20 cm cone type speaker unit with a RADIAL cone is used for the low range.<br>While taking advantage of the advantages of polypropylene, this cone optimizes the amount of aluminum, and by changing the amount of blend from the center of the diaphragm to the periphery, it reduces various problems that occur on the cone surface in the middle and low band and middle and high band.<br>In addition, in the HL Compact 7ES-2, in partnership with BBS engineers, the RADIAL cone has been further polished to improve reproducibility in a compact enclosure.<br><br>A 2.5 cm hard dome type tweeter is used for the high range.<br>The diaphragm is made of aluminum and has a high input resistant design.<br><br>The network uses carefully selected top-quality parts, including computer-grade fiberglass substrates.<br>The assembled circuit is tested one by one by computer, and after the matching is made, the trial listening is repeated and mounted.<br>The speaker terminal can be bi-wired and can be connected to a banana plug.<br><br>The enclosure is designed in accordance with the BBC tradition with removable front and rear baffles to create a lossy coupling structure.<br>In addition, by creating a sandwich structure in which multiple materials with different resonance and stiffness are layered between hard materials, resonance is damped not by weight or rigidity but by the physical properties of the material itself and its combination.<br>In addition, we have adopted the Super Tuned Structure, which is tuned based on computer analysis so that thin materials can react quickly to the sound energy rather than making the structure thick and difficult to control. By tuning the mass and compliance of the materials, we have succeeded in eliminating unwanted resonance in the especially important mid-range from the materials.<br>The edges of the front baffle have been rounded to reduce acoustic diffraction at the edges.<br>The jersey grill is installed using a method called SuperGrille, which is embedded in the groove of the front baffle to enhance the sense of unity with the enclosure and reduce the effect on sound quality.<br>Not only does it protect the driver unit, but it is designed to listen when normally worn with a grill that smooths out the sound radiation.<br>The exterior is a cheek finish.</p>
