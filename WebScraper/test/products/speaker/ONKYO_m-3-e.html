				<p class="detail">This speaker system is based on the M-6 design policy.<br><br>The M-3 covers the dynamic range of the program source by improving linearity at minute input as well as large input and high efficiency.<br>In addition, the woofer operates almost in the full range, and the band which occupies most of the music sound energy distribution is covered by the single, and the crossover network which accompanies this is also simplified to improve the orientation.<br><br>A 28 cm cone type woofer W-3030A is mounted in the low range.<br>A seat cone with multi-corrugation, which is strong against large input, is used for the diaphragm. This is driven by a 50 φ mm long voice coil and a large magnetic circuit of 120 φ x60 f x20mm to realize large input and high efficiency.<br>In addition, a specially molded 2-layer urethane edge is used for the edge part. Two types of urethane foam with different physical properties, an ester type for the upper layer and an ether type for the lower layer, are bonded together at a ratio of 3 : 7. In addition, the edge is molded into a special shape that reduces the density from the cone paper side to the frame side. This enables linear tracking even when the cone moves violently with large amplitude and vibration, and suppresses non-linear distortion.<br>The damper is made of special polymer material with high strength, high heat resistance, low hysteresis and excellent response characteristics. Mechanical resistance is reduced and damping characteristics are improved. Linearity is also improved by molding into long-stroke corrugation.<br><br>A 4 cm cone type tweeter, TW-407A is mounted in the high range.<br>Three types of pulp blend cones are used for the diaphragm. By mixing an appropriate amount of three types of pulp with different physical properties : softwood pulp (rigidity), Edgeworthia chrysantha (toughness), and Kapok (light and large internal loss), each characteristic is mixed, satisfying the requirements of corn paper, and realizing well extended high frequency characteristics, excellent transient characteristics, and high efficiency.<br><br>It is equipped with a mode selector which is different from general level control.<br>Mode 1 is suitable for general listening rooms and is best when the sound characteristics of the room are well balanced. Mode 2 is suitable when you want to emphasize high and low frequencies such as jazz or rock, or when the sound characteristics of the room are relatively dead.<br>Set Mode 3 when you want to enjoy quiet sounds or when you feel loud in middle and high areas such as in a room that you can feel live.<br><br>The enclosure has a structure with a clear attenuation waveform with sufficient thickness and reinforcement. A slit is provided in the port for bass reflex to improve low-frequency braking. The position of the port for bass reflex and the adapter for installation of the tweeter can be changed. By changing one port, the system can be made symmetrical.<br>The exterior is coated with polyurethane.</p>
