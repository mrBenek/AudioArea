				<p class="detail">This is a speaker system developed by inheriting various speaker technologies demonstrated in DENON&#39;s highest class floor type speaker system SC 5000 to the maximum extent.<br><br>A 30 cm cone type woofer is installed in the low range.<br>Similar to SC-5000, High-M / P diaphragm with integrated rib structure is used for the diaphragm. This diaphragm is made of wood pulp mixed with refined ramie fiber. After carefully beating it to control the distribution of fiber length, it is manufactured with an integrated rib pattern by a new technology that makes paper. As a result, in addition to the physical properties of low density and moderate internal loss of paper, it achieves both extremely light weight and high rigidity.<br>This rib pattern is formed by 5 concentric circular ribs and 13 radial ribs. While reducing the static mass of the cone section by about 10%, the rigidity is doubled by the conventional paper cone, and the deflection (deformation) of the diaphragm under Dainyu force is prevented. Peaks and dips are also suppressed, harmonic distortion is reduced and flat frequency characteristics are realized.<br>The drive section is composed of a large ferrite magnet with a diameter of 156 mm. A voice coil with a diameter of 60 mm is used for the voice coil in consideration of balance. An aluminum bobbin with high heat radiation effect is used for this voice coil.<br>The support system consists of a large flat damper with a linear motion corrugate curve with greatly improved linearity, and an edge formed into a roll of urethane foam and coated with a damping agent from the back surface to expand linearity.<br>Thick die-cast frame is used for the frame.<br><br>The mid-range is equipped with a 10 cm cone type squaker.<br>The High-M-T guidance plate is used for the diaphragm. It is made of a woven fabric of high-elasticity fibers, which is a kind of polymer compound, reinforced with epoxy resin, and maintains an ideal internal loss over a wider band than wood pulp, while achieving hardness approximately three times that of paper. The Skoker uses a double-layered structure of two High-M-T diaphragms so that the folds of the woven fabric are 45 degrees to each other. The direction of surface rigidity is uniform, and uniform internal loss is extended over a wider band. It is possible to expand the piston motion range and reduce resonance Q in the split resonance range, and the sound pressure frequency characteristics are further flattened.<br>The magnetic circuit is combined with a large ferrite magnet with the same diameter of 100 mm as the diaphragm to achieve high efficiency and a combination with a high heat-resistant voice coil to achieve high input resistance.<br>Aluminum die-cast frame is used for the frame.<br><br>A 5 cm cone type tweeter is installed in the high range.<br>The diaphragm has a semi-dome shape. The center dome portion is made of a special aluminum alloy with a thickness of 30 microns to increase the area of the dome portion, and the balance between the diaphragm portion and sound pressure radiation has been sufficiently examined. The cone portion is made of a High-M-T diaphragm, which is the same material as the Scorker, to expand the piston motion region and reduce the resonance Q in the divided resonance region, and flatten the summer frequency characteristics.<br>In addition, by eliminating the damper and connecting the diaphragm directly to the voice coil bobbin, loss of driving force is eliminated, and the weight of the entire vibration system is reduced to achieve high-speed response.<br>A ferrite magnet with a diameter of 100 mm is used for the magnetic circuit. By combining it with a voice coil that is lightweight and heat-resistant, it achieves high efficiency and high input resistance.<br>Aluminum die-cast frame is used for the frame.<br><br>Level control is provided for the middle and high frequencies.<br><br>Direct wiring and one point ground connection are used in the network section to minimize losses in the circuit.<br><br>The enclosure is hermetically sealed.<br>Hard particle board is used for the plate material, and the sound image localization is improved by the symmetrical design of the unit layout.<br>The exterior has a walnut natural wood finish.</p>
