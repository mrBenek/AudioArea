				<p class="detail">This is a speaker system that reexamines the origin of the speaker and clarifies the higher-dimensional &quot;dynamic&quot; and &quot;static&quot;, improves sound radiation characteristics, and eliminates energy loss.<br><br>A 30 cm polygonal carbon ceramic woofer is used for the low range.<br>The carbon diaphragm of this woofer has improved rigidity by using 3000 filler carbon, which is made by bundling 3000 carbon fibers, three times as many as the conventional diaphragm made by weaving 1000 carbon fibers into a single thread and plain-woven. In addition, the carbon fiber is entangled with ceramic-reinforced powder to suppress the unique sound of carbon.<br>In addition, the diaphragm has a 7-division structure and eliminates structural noise by cutting off the concentric circle mode.<br>In the magnetic circuit, a large strontium ferrite magnet of φ 180 mm is adopted. It drives powerfully with a total magnetic flux of 200,000 maxwell, and strain is reduced by adopting a perforated T-shaped pole.<br>In addition, it uses a unique class A suspension that suppresses non-linear motion of the diaphragm by using two suspensions.<br><br>Kenwood&#39;s original 8 cm spherical wave horn scoker is used for the middle range.<br>The wave surface generated from the diaphragm is set in a dome shape to be a spherical wave, and a baffle with a unique shape is installed in the opening so that the spherical wave can be spread smoothly in space.<br>This structure makes it possible to approach the ideal respiratory sphere operation of the speaker, and at the same time, it eliminates the irregular reflection at the aperture, which was an element to be improved in the horn type, and improves directivity and efficiency.<br>The semi-dome diaphragm uses a newly developed crystal plasma diamond diaphragm. In addition, the voice coil bobbin and dome part are integrated to prevent transmission loss, and a unique DSD with improved performance as a squaker unit is mounted.<br>In addition, the magnetic circuit is equipped with a large φ 156 mm strontium magnet, and the frame uses a composite anti-vibration frame made of iron and aluminum.<br><br>A hard dome tweeter of 2.5 cm is adopted for the high range.<br>For the diaphragm of this tweeter, crystal plasma diamond diaphragm is used, which is a further development of plasma diamond diaphragm made of diamond and titanium base material, and various acoustic constants are improved. In addition, spherical wave horn baffle with good sound radiation characteristics is installed to improve directional characteristics.<br>In addition, in order to improve the SN ratio, it is equipped with a direct inner Class A suspension that eliminates unnecessary edge radiation, and transmission loss is suppressed by the integrated structure of voice coil and dome.<br><br>In the LS-G5000, we have taken measures for fixing the unit to the front baffle, taking into consideration the adverse effects caused by fixing the unit to the front baffle.<br>In order to prevent harmful vibrations from occurring in the front baffle due to the amplitude of the woofer unit, a 50 mm thick front baffle is sandwiched by die casts and tightened strongly from the front and back using a super press lock mounting method.<br>Since the front baffle can be fixed several times more firmly than the system in which the front baffle is simply fixed with a screw, the vibration supporting point is clarified, enabling sound reproduction at lower frequencies more firmly.<br>In addition, a high-rigidity vibration-proof top plate with an exceptionally large top plate is directly attached to the baffle plate to reduce the vibration of the unit.<br>In addition, in order to prevent the surface wave vibration from the woofer transmitted through the front baffle and to prevent the diffuse reflection of the sound emitted from the squaker and the tweeter, an extremely thin and deep groove of 0.6 mm width and 10 mm depth is cut around the squaker and the tweeter by woodworking technology using laser beams.<br><br>In order to increase the rigidity of the enclosure, the front baffle plate is 50 mm thick and 20 mm baffle reinforcement plates are used around the skauker and tweeter to prevent the effect of the back pressure of the woofer.<br>In addition, the back plate has a pyramidal structure to suppress the generation of standing waves in the cabinet, and the front baffle has a round on both sides to improve the diffraction phenomenon.<br><br>In order to eliminate transmission loss in the network section, we use extra-thick oxygen-free copper cables for internal wiring, large coils made of large silicon steel core materials for coils, and large electrolytic capacitors and solderless caulescent wires to prevent energy loss.<br>In addition, considering crosstalk distortion between networks and between units and networks, we have adopted a distributed network by band.<br><br>There was a special speaker stand sold separately.</p>
