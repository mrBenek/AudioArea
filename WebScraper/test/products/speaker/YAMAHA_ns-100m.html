				<p class="detail">This is a speaker system with a clear concept of &quot;original book shelf&quot; by rethinking what a bookshelf type is and how it should be.<br><br>A 20 cm cone type woofer is used for the low range.<br>For corn paper, we use white corn produced by Yamaha&#39;s original sheet manufacturing method based on the accumulated know-how of material research.<br>This corn paper is made from a sheet of foreign coniferous wood based raw materials by a special manufacturing method incorporating old Japanese paper technology, and finished into a cone-type straight cone with clear motion characteristics. Because of the sheet manufacturing method, there is less unevenness in density and thickness compared with the produced corn paper. Moreover, because the paper quality is finished in the Middle Ages (PH7), there is less change over time and durability is improved.<br>The voice coil for driving the cone paper is made of a kraft paper bobbin wound with copper flat wire with high space factor and heat-resistant adhesive. The damper diameter is 20% larger than the conventional one so that it can withstand large amplitude, and the material and impregnation agent are newly examined.<br>A strong magnet with a total magnetic flux of 78,000 maxwell is used, and an acoustic aluminum die-cast frame is used.<br><br>We have developed and adopted a multi-coating agent that blends 7 kinds of viscoelastic chemicals for 6 hours for the soft dome diaphragm in the middle and high frequency range. Since it is adopted for both the tweeter and skoker, the sound connection between units and characters are unified.<br>In addition, the fabric molded into the soft dome is an original woven fabric developed exclusively for it, and the density of the warp and weft is made to be the same, and directivity and dispersion are suppressed.<br>In addition, since each tangential edge is integrally molded, no edge is added later and no coating agent is applied after molding, resulting in an excellent balance and high accuracy.<br><br>A 5.5 cm soft dome type skoker is used for the middle area.<br>The dome shape is set to the optimum value for obtaining excellent frequency characteristics and directivity, and glass wool is filled as a damping material on the back of the diaphragm. The optimum value is 0.3 ± 0.05g, which is a strict design.<br>The voice coil is made of Yamaha&#39;s original FRP sheet made of glass fiber and tightly wound with copper flat wire with high space factor to achieve high input resistance. Ferrite magnet is used for the magnet.<br>In addition, the glass wool filled inside the unit and the air brake by the installation of the back cavity work together, and fo is finished as low as 400 Hz, making the connection with the woofer smooth.<br><br>A 3.0 cm soft dome type tweeter is used for the high range.<br>The voice coil is made of an edgewise winding of copper clad aluminum ribbon wire, which is lightweight and has good conductivity, and is directly connected to the soft dome diaphragm to reduce the weight of the vibration system.<br>A magnetic circuit with a total flux of 20,000 maxwell is used.<br>In addition, an acoustic diffuser is installed on the front to improve directional and frequency characteristics.<br><br>In the network, decisions are made by cut-and-try based on the sense of hearing.<br>For the coil, 99.98% purity copper wire with low DC resistance is used for bobbin made of ferrite core, and MP tubular capacitor is used for the capacitor.<br>In addition, in order to reduce the reverberation between the coils, the coils are mounted at right angles, and the input terminal is not relayed from the output terminal to the input terminal so as to prevent the deterioration of damping and the increase of distortion at large input.<br><br>The Tweeter and Skoker are equipped with continuously variable level control.<br><br>The enclosure is a six sided one piece structure consisting of a single front-facing particleboard joined by a strong adhesive.<br>In particular, for the connection of the baffle plate (20 mm) and the side plate (15 mm) with different thicknesses, a three way flow stopper is adopted, which requires advanced technology, to improve rigidity. In addition, baffle cut-out material is attached to the back plate, and each part is reinforced to suppress unnecessary resonance. In addition, two types of glass wool with different densities are used depending on the location for the filler material to bring out the sense of volume especially in the low range.<br>The exterior finish is the same as the NS-1000M with 7 steps and layer black monitor finish.<br><br>In consideration of phase and directional characteristics, the mounting position of the unit is designed to be symmetrical.</p>
