				<p class="detail">A 2-way floor type speaker system developed based on the know-how cultivated in the Scepter series speakers and the new theory proposed in the Grand Scepter GS-1.<br><br>A 28 cm cone type woofer is used for the low range.<br>Corn paper is made from wood pulp produced in high latitudes near the Arctic Circle, refined and mixed with ascidian cellulose, which is the most highly crystallized of natural cellulose. The integration of these two types of cellulose forms a network of dense paper layers, improving rigidity and airtightness.<br>In addition, by adopting a large diameter voice coil of 7.6 cm, the distance to the edge is shortened, and low sound with excellent transient is realized.<br>The magnetic circuit uses a large magnet and a copper cap to reduce harmonic distortion.<br><br>The high-frequency range uses a super hyperbolic horn with a cut-off frequency of 500 Hz.<br>The super hyperbolic horn is a technology developed at the time of the development of the GS-1. It adopts the hyperbolic function for the change in cross-sectional area and the super elliptic function including the oblate function and the shape function for the change in shape. By solving these simultaneous equations, the horn has a smooth extension without sudden shape change.<br>This reduces the phenomenon called &quot;multipath ghost distortion&quot; in which high frequencies are reflected inside the horn due to stays, separators, steps, and irregularities inside the horn.<br>In addition, in order to prevent a phenomenon called &quot;Reverb distortion&quot; in which unnecessary sound components are generated by vibration of the horn itself, approximately 2g/cm is added to the material of the horn.<sup>3</sup>By using resin concrete with a specific gravity of approximately 12 kg, the strain is reduced.<br>The driver&#39;s 3.5 cm diaphragm uses reinforced A1-Mg alloy and is made by integral molding with the tangential edge which has excellent symmetry of amplitude.<br>This diaphragm has been stabilized to prevent the original physical properties of the material from changing due to the stress applied to the metal during molding, so that the characteristics before molding are not lost.<br><br>In the network, the filters for the woofer and the filters for the tweeter are built into each unit and are completely separated.<br>In addition, in the network, all parts that need to be separated into circuits and parts are divided to form an isolated wiring network with little distortion and no mutual interference.<br><br>One problem with horn-type speakers is that because the horn diaphragm is positioned behind the woofer by the length of the horn, there is a gap in the time it takes to reach the listener&#39;s ear.<br>This appears as a disturbance in the characteristics near the crossover frequency. The time axis control circuit eliminates this disturbance and smooths the connection between units.<br><br>The high-range and low-range sections have independent filters, enabling bi-amplifier and bi-wiring connections.<br><br>In order to reduce unnecessary strain components (Reverb strain) generated by the vibration of the enclosure itself, the cabinet is not only reinforced in an invisible manner, but also actively employs a &quot;constrained damping method&quot; using damping materials and steel plates to reduce vibration.<br>An acoustic wave regulator is also installed to absorb standing waves inside the enclosure.<br>For vertical standing waves, a slit chamber at the bottom of the speaker is used as a wave regulator, and the section seen from the top of the cabinet is shaped like a ladder to prevent horizontal standing waves from occurring.<br>The net of the woofer is detachable.</p>
