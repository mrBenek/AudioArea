				<p class="detail">A large-floor-type speaker system that adopts beryllium diaphragm for middle and high range units.<br><br>It is equipped with JA 3601 which is a 36 cm cone type woofer in the low range.<br>The cone uses a conical type with corrugation made from pulp that has been carefully examined in terms of sound quality. It reduces split vibration and provides a wide range of piston motion. In addition, urethane foam roll edge is used for the edge. The linearity of the damper is improved by giving sufficient consideration to the base fabric and impregnation agent.<br>The voice coil is a long voice coil type in which copper ribbon wire is wound edgewise on a heat-resistant NOMEX bobbin. It ensures good linearity even under Dainyu force. A zinc-reinforced ring is attached to the neck of the voice coil to prevent irregular motion caused by the deflection of the voice coil and to suppress harmonic distortion.<br>The magnetic circuit uses a large ferrite magnet of 200 φ x120 φ x20tmm to obtain a total magnetic flux of 260,000 maxwell and a magnetic flux density of 12,000 gauss. The center pole is covered with a copper cap a copper cap to minimize the generation of magnetic distortion, reducing the annoying third harmonic distortion.<br>The frame uses an aluminum die-cast frame exclusively for audio.<br><br>The middle area is equipped with JA 0802 which is a 8.8 cm hard dome type skoker.<br>The diaphragm uses a beryllium diaphragm with a small radius of curvature (deep dome shape) made by Yamaha&#39;s electron beam vacuum evaporation method. Several molds (substrates) are put into a vacuum evaporation furnace to manufacture several sheets at the same time. One of the completed diaphragms is immediately incorporated into a unit for trial listening. If not satisfied, all of the diaphragms deposited at the same time are discarded. In addition, a diffuser is used to suppress the valley caused by interference in the out-of-band on-axis characteristics occurs when the beryllium diaphragm is shaped into a dome shape with a small radius of curvature.<br>The voice coil is made of a durable kraft paper bobbin with strong edgewise winding of copper ribbon wire with high space factor. The edge is made of a special fiber tangential edge with high linearity by double coating of viscoelastic resin and thermosetting resin.<br>In order to ensure linear and high-transient operation, this SCOKER takes into consideration that the air pressure in each part such as the beryllium diaphragm, voice coil and tangential edge is equal. Behind the diaphragm, the center pole is largely hollowed out and communicates with the back cavity. Behind the voice coil, an air hole is made in the bottom plate of the magnetic circuit and communicates with the back cavity. In addition, behind the edge, a hole is made in the voice coil bobbin and a hole is made in the outer pole to ensure linear operation of the vibration system.<br>The magnetic circuit uses ferrite magnet of 156 φ x80 φ x25tmm, realizing total magnetic flux of 130,000 maxwell and magnetic flux density of 16,000 gauss.<br><br>A 3.0 cm hard dome type tweeter, JA 0526, is mounted in the high range.<br>The diaphragm is made of beryllium, similar to Scoker, and is a 0.028g lightweight diaphragm. The voice coil is made of a kraft paper bobbin with an edgewise winding of lightweight copper-clad aluminum ribbon wire. It is supported by a special fiber tangential edge with double coating of viscoelastic resin and thermosetting resin.<br>The magnetic circuit uses a 100 φ x50 φ x22tmm ferrite magnet with a total magnetic flux of 33,000 maxwell and a magnetic flux density of 18,500 gauss.<br><br>For the network section, a large ferrite core bobbin and 99.98% pure copper wire with low DC resistance are used, and MP capacitors selected by sound quality check are used as capacitors.<br>In addition, in order to reduce the effect of mutual inductance between coils, the coils are mounted at right angles to each other with a sufficient distance.<br><br>Skokor and tweeter are equipped with continuously variable level control.<br>The attenuator used has a sufficiently large allowable input and a precision attenuator with low sound quality degradation.<br><br>The enclosure is finished as a large-capacity floor type with an internal volume of 120L.<br>The entire surface is made of the same particleboard. The surface is finished with a shiny oak finish and the baffle plate is finished with a black finish. This particleboard is denser and harder than ordinary ones. It is reinforced using the woodworking know-how gained through the manufacture of musical instruments.</p>
