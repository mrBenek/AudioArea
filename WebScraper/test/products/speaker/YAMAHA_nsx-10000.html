				<p class="detail">This speaker system was developed to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Yamaha&#39;s founding. The concept of this system is to clear the physical possibilities of digital sound in terms of performance, and to sing out the musical possibilities of digital sound in terms of sound quality.<br>We aim to achieve no-distortion, high-transient and no-noise, high-resolution capabilities comparable to digital sources.<br><br>A cone type unit with a 33 cm pure carbon diaphragm is used for the low range.<br>In order to take advantage of the characteristics of carbon, it is made of long-fiber carbon fiber and unidirectional arrangement, which is well known for NS-2000 and NS-1000X.<br>This is a long-fiber roll sheet that can be said to be the prototype of carbon fiber. It is made by stacking four sheets of a fan-shaped sheet, 32 sheets of a cone divided into eight equal parts, cut in the fiber direction, and shifted by one fourth with resin as a matrix.<br>The shape of the diaphragm is a straight conical type and realizes high rigidity while taking advantage of tensile and compressive strength in the fiber direction.<br>The center cap also uses the same unidirectional arrangement and long-fiber pure carbon fiber.<br>The voice coil is an edgewise wound voice coil that uses OFC (oxygen-free copper) wire for the wire material.<br>The frame has been newly designed using computer simulation technology to suppress resonance. The aluminum die-cast frame for the woofer is 12 mm thick at the frame flange. The frame arm has also been modified from the usual V-shaped arm to a U-shaped arm. The frame arm is moved out of the frequency band where the primary resonance mode occurs within the frequency band used by the woofer.<br>In addition, in order to suppress unnecessary vibration of each part of the woofer including the magnet, the frame and the bottom plate are joined by 4 bolts of 10 mm diameter like sandwiching the magnet, and the rigidity of the whole woofer unit is further increased.<br><br>For the mid-range and high-range, 8.8 cm and 3.0 cm dome type units with GC beryllium are adopted.<br>GC beryllium improves the structure of beryllium crystals and achieves giant crystallization. Since each crystal grows large, there are fewer boundaries between crystals, reducing the transmission loss of sound waves.<br>The voice coil bobbin is also made of GC-beryllium, which is the same material used for the diaphragm, to improve the heat conduction characteristics, thereby improving the allowable input resistance. The wire is made of OFC (oxygen-free copper) wire for the Skoker, and copper-clad / aluminum wire for the tweeter, making it an edge-wise wound voice coil.<br>It is equipped with a diffuser and made of brass in order to expand the medium and high sound with strong rectilinear motion to the listening area with wide angle.<br>After carefully polishing each piece with fine buffing material, clear lacquer is applied to keep the luster.<br><br>The baffle surface of the enclosure uses Yamaha&#39;s unique bending and kneading round baffle. This is based on the same method as the molding of the side plate of a grand piano. Twelve carefully examined birch slice plates are attached to the metal mold one by one. They are carefully bent and bonded together with a special adhesive under pressure. Thus, the front baffle has a round section without any intervening joint member.<br>As a result, resonance due to insufficient strength of the enclosure, which occurs with the conventional round baffle for cutting the side plate, and loss at the joint surface due to the use of round-shaped joint members are suppressed.<br>The joint with the side plate has been changed to the general 45-degree plane joint, and the finger joint method has been introduced, which is advantageous for structural strength and adhesive surface strength, so that the side plate receives the pressure of the front baffle straightly.<br>In addition, the finger-joint joints are reinforced from the back of the enclosure using solid beech to ensure perfect strength around the round section.<br>American Walnut is used for the exterior decoration material, and it has an open pore finish unique to Yamaha that makes use of the texture of the wood grain fabric.<br><br>In order to avoid coloring caused by soldering errors, etc., we have introduced plasma spot welding, which does not use dissimilar metals between parts.<br>In this method, part terminals are locally heated and welded together, and the contact potential difference due to dissimilar metals such as solder is suppressed to 0.<br>We also use large MP capacitors and OFC (oxygen-free copper) wire-wound voice coils with a silicon-steel core.<br>OFC (oxygen-free copper) wires are also used for internal wiring, and a large gold-plated screw type is used for speaker terminals, which is suitable for extremely thick cables.</p>
