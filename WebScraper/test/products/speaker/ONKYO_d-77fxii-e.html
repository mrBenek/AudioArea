				<p class="detail">A speaker system that further advanced the MID4 concept as an improved version of the D-77FX.<br><br>To further promote the MID4 concept, both Woofer and Skoker cover a cutoff frequency of 2000 Hz, eliminating crossover from vocals and formant frequencies.<br>Combining the advantages of a large-diameter woofer, which is advantageous for dynamic low-range playback, and a small-diameter squaker, which is advantageous for cross directivity, it realizes powerful vocal playback and crisp low-range playback.<br><br>For the low range, a 27 cm cone-shaped woofer with a bicycloscone diaphragm is used.<br>Biochloroscone is a mixture of wood pulp produced in high latitudes near the Arctic and refined cellulose, which is highly crystalline among natural cellulose. By integrating these two types of cellulose to form a paper layer network, physical properties with a balance of rigidity and confidentiality are obtained.<br><br>The middle area uses a 16 cm cone type squaker made of the same bio black cone as the woofer.<br><br>For the high-frequency band, we adopted the SH horn tweeter developed by taking advantage of the know-how of the Super Hypervolic Horn (SH (SH Horn) developed in the Ground Receptor GS-1.<br>The change in Horn cross section is determined by hyperbolic function, and the change in shape is determined by superelliptic function including oblate function and shape function, by solving these simultaneous equations.<br>We have also taken thorough measures to eliminate multipath ghost distortion, which is a problem in horn sound quality, from the aspects of horn shape and structure.<br>In addition, Onkyo has developed its own technology for mass production of horns, such as the ultra-precision press method that improves the accuracy of the height and shape of the diaphragm, and the manufacturing process that uses the slide type pole piece to achieve matching between a narrow gap, ultra-precision driver section and an SH horn with a cutoff frequency of 1000 Hz, thus realizing the high transient and power linearity inherent in horns.<br>The diaphragm is made of aluminum and magnesium alloy, which is lightweight and has a high internal loss, in order to obtain more natural sound quality.<br><br>M.D. C.T. (Magnetic Distortion Cancel Technology) has been introduced, and the Skoker and Tweeter are equipped with copper rings, while the Woofer is equipped with aluminum rings to reduce harmonic distortion.<br>Also, a new and large magnetic circuit is used.<br>In addition, a canceling magnet is used to suppress magnetic flux leakage and prevent magnetic field effects on the choke coil in the network. At the same time, the canceling magnet prevents interference with the cathode ray tube during layout.<br><br>The network is designed with attention paid to the smooth connection of units at the same time. The circuit board for each unit is divided, and all parts that need to be divided including circuits and parts are divided, so that the network has no mutual interference and little distortion.<br><br>The enclosure employs an acoustic wave regulator composed of a slit and a chamber as a standing wave countermeasure, and the use of sound absorbing material is minimized so as not to affect other necessary frequency ranges.<br>In addition, specially selected high-density particleboards are used to reduce vibration of the enclosure, and mechanical strength is increased by reinforcing the angle block, the center of the front baffle and the top plate.<br><br>In order to improve the sound quality when installed in the listening room, the special speaker stand (sold separately) is also designed with high rigidity and no resonance. It uses a single-leg structure that does not generate standing waves and is made of hard particle board with the same strength as the D-77FXII body.<br>You can also fine-tune the height of the two rear points out of the four front points for flat and steady settings on uneven floors.</p>
