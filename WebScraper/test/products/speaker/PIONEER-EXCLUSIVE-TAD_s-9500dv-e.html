				<p class="detail">A 3-way speaker system with a low magnetic leakage design for the AV age.<br><br>DRS (Dynamic Response Suspension) which produces excellent linearity is adopted in each unit.<br>The woofer uses a double Ayaori damper with high air permeability and low mechanical resistance, and the mid-range uses a newly developed chemical edge and acoustic control inside the chamber to reduce back pressure nonlinearity.<br>In addition, the tweeter efficiently converts input signals into air signals using a triple suspension structure and a new horn.<br><br>A 32 cm cone type unit is used for the low range.<br>This unit uses a woofer with a full-range voice coil and a low-range voice coil, and uses an electronic bass drive (EBD) system to improve the low-range frequency by adding only an ultra-low-range signal to the low-range voice coil.<br>In addition, the Linear Drive Magnetic Circuit (LDMC), which eliminates the nonlinearity of the driving force due to the amplitude of the voice coil, has been adopted by installing a pole piece and a sub pole in the magnetic circuit to make the magnetic flux distribution symmetrical in front and back, thereby reducing the amplitude distortion factor to 1/2 to 1/3 of the conventional one.<br>In addition, high-precision technologies such as DRS and increased frame strength have been introduced into the system.<br>In addition, leakage flux is reduced by dual magnet system.<br><br>A 7.6 cm dome type unit has been adopted for the middle area.<br>Φ 76 mm beryllium mid-range is used for the diaphragm.<br>In addition, we have introduced a number of new technologies to prevent the sound from becoming muddy, such as double dump of the equalizer.<br><br>A beryllium ribbon tweeter developed by Pioneer is used for the high frequency band.<br>The magnetic shield cap reduces leakage flux and prevents the effect on the cathode ray tube.<br><br>The network will be studied in terms of circuit configuration, elements and layout. King reduction has been completely eliminated.<br>It employs a balanced network circuit (PAT. P) that absorbs the back electromotive force of the woofer and prevents leakage from the ground line. It also eliminates magnetic materials that cause transmission distortion from screws and nuts. It uses a film capacitor with an order of magnitude lower ESR (equivalent series resistance) than conventional film. It also uses very thick oxygen-free copper wires for choke coils and lead wires. Thus, we pursue low loss and low crosstalk.<br><br>The enclosure is also carefully designed in terms of shape and material.<br>High-density softwood particle board with excellent acoustic characteristics is used for the front baffle, and the round baffle with R at the left and right corners eliminates diffraction phenomenon.<br>This realizes a natural sound field and greatly improves the transient characteristics of middle and high sound.<br>In addition, a symmetrical unit design was adopted to obtain clear sound image localization, and it is a real cabinet with craft finish using ebony material.</p>
