				<p class="detail">Rather than simply pursuing characteristics, we went back to the starting point of the speaker system design and fully examined its original form. This system was completed with excellent characteristics and support from sufficient listening.<br><br>A 30 cm cone type unit is used for the low range.<br>A FB type clear cone is used for the cone paper. In addition, a special damping material is attached to the reinforced cone to withstand a large input. This prevents split vibration in the high-frequency range and improves low-frequency characteristics.<br>In addition, high-quality urethane foam material is used for the edge, and the characteristic change due to temperature change is little, and the characteristic is improved stably.<br>The voice coil is edgewise wound with aluminum ribbon wire, and the effects of aluminum foil bobbin, thermosetting epoxy adhesive, and short winding combine to improve heat radiation effect and input resistance characteristics.<br>The magnetic circuit uses a magnet with a diameter of 180 mm φ and a diameter of 1.8 kg, the same size as the one used in Pioneer&#39;s 38 cm woofer.<br>Furthermore, in order to reduce the distortion factor, the center pole is covered with a pure copper cap to thoroughly suppress the magnetic distortion (driving force distortion) caused by the magnetic circuit.<br><br>A 6.5 cm dome type unit is adopted for the middle area.<br>The suspension of the vibration system adopts a wired suspension system using beryllium copper wire.<br>This suspension is a method of supporting a dome-shaped vibration part at five points through a wire. The wire draws a slight curve in the vibration direction in order to give the direction of vibration, and is molded with a tapered silicon rubber that is thick on the flange side and becomes thinner toward the voice coil side.<br>By adopting this suspension, radiation of sound emitted from the edge is prevented, and by adding clarity of the supporting device, strain is greatly reduced and transient characteristics are improved.<br>The size of the diaphragm is set at 65 mm in consideration of the cross point, etc., keep the amplitude small and to reduce the IM distortion.<br>The magnetic circuit is equipped with a back chamber at the rear, and the fo is as low as 300 Hz. The hole in the center of the pole is tapered, and the inner surface is covered with felt to prevent resonance. At the same time, glass wool is placed in the back chamber to provide sufficient sound absorption.<br>In addition, the center pole is covered with a copper cap similar to the woofer to prevent distortion from the magnetic circuit.<br>A large magnet with a diameter of 156 mm φ and a weight of 1.2 kg is used, and an edgewise winding with aluminum ribbon wire is used for the voice coil.<br><br>A 2.0 cm dome-shaped unit is used for the high range.<br>It is a vibration system combining duralumin dome of 20 mm in diameter and 30 μ in thickness with double-structured urethane foam edge and edgewise wound voice coil of aluminum ribbon wire.<br>The dome is small in diameter and has a deep depth to widen the directional characteristic.<br>Since the edge is double-structured and the front surface is a continuous bubble surface, there is no sound radiation from the edge to reduce distortion. In addition, a large amount of micro glass wool is embedded inside the dome.<br>The front 10 fins protect the diaphragm and increase the sound diffusion effect at the same time.<br>The magnetic circuit has a magnetic flux density of 16,000G, and the size of the magnet is the same size as the 16 cm speaker PAX-A16.<br><br>The attenuation of the network is 12dB/oct.<br>In addition, the impedance rise at the fo of the mid-range and tweeter is corrected by a correction circuit, and the impedance of each speaker is made flat, so that the cutoff characteristic is straightforward and the characteristics near the crossover are improved.<br>The level is controlled by step-down of the coil and simultaneous switching of the compensation resistor. The mid-range is controlled by four 2-dB steps and the high-range is controlled by five 2-dB steps.<br><br>The enclosure is a air suspension system with attention paid to materials and manufacturing methods.<br>The material is a combination of 25 mm thick rigid particle board and lauan plywood. For internal reinforcement, four small holes are made in a flat material instead of the conventional bar reinforcement material. The purpose of preventing standing waves is achieved simultaneously with the reinforcement of the front, rear, left and right sides.<br>In addition, 800g of glass wool is contained in an orderly manner and treated effectively.<br>In addition, the enclosure baffle surface is perfectly flat and the grill net is modified so as not to damage the speaker&#39;s playback characteristics.<br>The surface has a gorgeous finish of Brazilian rosewood.</p>
