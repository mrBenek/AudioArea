				<p class="detail">This speaker system was released as the fifth edition of the best-selling D-77 series.<br>The XG uses oval diaphragms for the middle and high ranges to improve the sound quality in the middle range.<br><br>A 28 cm cone woofer is used for the low range.<br>Pure cross carbon is used for the diaphragm, and the curved cone is used to remove the peak of resonance and improve the transient without losing the characteristics.<br>In addition, it uses engineering elastomer edge with high internal loss and excellent compliance.<br><br>A dome-type unit with an 8 cm oval diaphragm is used for the middle area.<br>The diaphragm has been specially processed so that the outer circumference is circular and gradually becomes elliptical toward the center, eliminating the mechanism of resonance generation.<br>In addition, the voice coil bobbin is continuously and integrally molded up to the dome diaphragm, greatly reducing the weight of the vibration system.<br>The voice coil uses an edgewise winding, which is a multiple winding of flat aluminum wire. This edgewise winding reduces weight and improves efficiency.<br>In addition, a special material sheet is attached to the surface of the frame to prevent reflection of sound waves and to absorb unwanted vibrations.<br><br>A 2.5 cm dome type unit with an oval diaphragm is adopted for the high range as well as the middle range.<br>By forming it into a resonance elimination pattern called an ellipse, the generation mechanism of resonance is suppressed.<br>In addition, the diaphragm and voice coil are integrally molded, and the weight reduction of the vibration system by aluminum edgewise winding, etc. and double magnet are adopted.<br><br>The network uses silicon-steel choke coils and low-distortion audio capacitors.<br>We also use a computer-linked magnetic flux distribution measuring device to determine the part layout that minimizes crosstalk caused by coupling between choke coils.<br>We also eliminate interference between units and networks by using a single-point grounding system that minimizes electrical loops and a separate woofer, circuit and squaker circuit system.<br><br>The enclosure is made of high-density particleboards, reinforced with angle block, the center of the front baffle, and the top plate for structural strength, and grooves are placed between the baffle and the enclosure to reduce vibration transmitted from the baffle to the enclosure.<br>The front baffle is flattened and has a 40 mm round on both sides to suppress the diffraction phenomenon of sound waves.<br>In order to obtain sound with bounciness and dynamic feeling, the sound absorbing material 0 design is adopted, and the structure (dispersion by two bars) that disperses standing wave is adopted.<br><br>Speaker stand with single leg structure made of hard particle board is sold separately.<br>There was also an optional high-density zircon sand to fill the legs of the speaker stand, which could increase weight by more than 5 kg per unit.</p>
