				<p class="detail">A speaker system with high rigidity for high-quality reproduction of digital sources.<br><br>A 32 cm cone woofer with a multi-layer carbon diaphragm is mounted in the low range.<br>A core material of special polymer foam for woofer has been developed for this diaphragm, and glass fiber with high strength is used for the back skin material and cross carbon is used for the front skin material.<br>In addition, the cross-carbon is divided into seven parts and pasted into a uniform texture, the diaphragm is highly rigid, and the effective energy is also improved by the curved cone shape.<br><br>A 10 cm cone type squaker using a carbon diaphragm is adopted for the middle area.<br>This carbon diaphragm is a multi-layer carbon diaphragm exclusively for SKORKER. It is made of a newly developed special polyester core material to sharpen the contour of the mid-range. Cross carbon is pasted into 7 parts on both sides. This carbon diaphragm achieves smooth linearity up to the high-range.<br><br>A 2.5 cm dome type tweeter made of titanium nitride dome is adopted for the high frequency band.<br>Titanium is used as the base material of the diaphragm, and the surface is specially processed to increase the rigidity and give an appropriate internal loss, thereby improving the high frequency reproduction capability.<br><br>A twin magnet system is used for the magnet of each unit.<br>It is equipped with a sub-magnet magnetized in the opposite direction to the main magnet. This ensures a high magnetic flux density comparable to that of a large magnet, while preventing leakage of magnetic flux, thereby eliminating adverse effects on the network.<br><br>The Woofer and Skoker units use aluminum die-cast frames designed based on vibration mode analysis.<br>In order to suppress the resonance of the frame itself, 2 types of bridge structures with different thickness are adopted. In addition, 8 Woofer bridges and 6 Skorker bridges are used to increase rigidity of the entire frame according to the energy level of the unit.<br><br>Sharp nuts are used to secure the unit. Eight 8-mm diameter bolts are used for the woofer, eight 6-mm bolts are used for the skoker, and four 5-mm bolts are used for the tweeter to secure the unit to the enclosure.<br><br>The network section of the woofer employs a floating system to eliminate adverse effects of vibration caused by pressure. In addition, each network element is band-fixed by placing a hard board with anti-vibration material on top of the sound absorbing material. In addition, each unit is an independent 3-division network to prevent interference of magnetic flux from the coil.<br>OFC material is used for all coil and extra-thick wiring material of 0.18 φ 50 core, and the connection part is caulked method with low contact resistance.<br><br>The enclosure has a dynamic isolation structure.<br>In this structure, in order to suppress adverse effects on other units caused by vibrations from the woofer, the tweeter and squaker are fixed to the sub-baffle and separated from the front baffle. Furthermore, an independent enclosure is provided to suppress adverse effects caused by back pressure.<br>In addition, to prevent the enclosure from vibrating back and forth and the rear baffle from resonating due to unbalanced center of gravity shifted to the front baffle in which the unit is fixed, two high-density acoustic boards of 25 mm thickness are used for the rear baffle to keep the front and back balance.<br>In addition, a four sided round baffle is adopted to prevent adverse effects due to diffraction phenomenon.</p>
