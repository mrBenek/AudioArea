				<p class="detail">A speaker system developed with a front-facing approach in order to accurately reproduce the music signal sent from the amplifier without coloring it.<br><br>A 30 cm woofer made of polypropylene cone is mounted in the low range.<br>Polypropylene cone has advantages such as superior material uniformity and strength compared with conventional paper cone, ability to expand piston motion range, low mechanical Q of high-frequency resonance (less than 1/10 of paper), and less distortion and disturbance of characteristics in high-frequency range.<br>In addition, a 50 mm φ long through voice coil has been adopted, and together with the polypropylene cone which is resistant to deformation, transient distortion at low frequency and large amplitude has been reduced.<br>In addition, with a till-bobbin that achieves both improved heat resistance and reduced weight, input resistance is improved without losing transient characteristics.<br><br>The middle area is equipped with a 12 cm cone type squaker made of polypropylene cone similar to the woofer.<br>Low-distortion and non-colorization design common to Woofer, such as till bobbin for improved transient and input resistance, and perforated pole piece for eliminating second harmonic distortion.<br><br>A newly developed dual-drive ribbon tweeter is installed in the high range.<br>A unique dual drive magnetic circuit drives a diaphragm with a coil printed on an ultra-thin film of a polymer material (polyimide) uniformly across the entire surface, improving various characteristics.<br>The printed coil system eliminates the need for a matching transformer, improves input resistance and sound quality, and achieves high efficiency by adopting a strong magnetic circuit and a short horn.<br><br>The network section is simple and low-loss designed to take advantage of the characteristics of each unit.<br>In addition to silicon-laminated steel core coils, audio only Chemicon and metalized polypropylene capacitors, large-capacity resistors and oxygen-free copper lead wires are used as elements.<br>The board is fixed to the bottom of the enclosure to eliminate vibration.<br><br>The enclosure uses a chip board with a higher density than ordinary enclosure materials, and the propagation and attenuation of vibration are faster, eliminating coloring caused by box rumbling, etc.<br>In addition, the exterior is finished with a veneer that has been repeatedly colored and polished several times. The surface hardness is higher than that of the usual oil finish, and vibration disturbance is prevented.</p>
