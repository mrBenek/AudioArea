				<p class="detail">This speaker system was developed as a 50th anniversary model of JBL with the theme of the new century standard.<br><br>The Century1200, a 30 cm cone shaped woofer, is installed in the low range.<br>This unit adopts the technology of K2, the highest peak of the JBL floor type, and uses composite cone mixed with fiberglass. The unique Aqua Plus coating on the surface realizes excellent rigidity and damping.<br>The magnetic circuit is equipped with a symmetrical field geometry (SFG) magnetic circuit to prevent magnetic distortion and improve the heat radiation effect of the voice coil.<br>In addition, a direct-bending type aluminum die-cast frame is used to efficiently release the sound pressure to the rear of the suspension.<br><br>The mid-range is equipped with a 12.5 cm cone-shaped mid-range Century500.<br>This unit uses Kevlar cone, which boasts light weight and high strength, and composite edge, which has elasticity and flexibility by combining rubber and vinyl to improve dynamic range.<br>The voice coil uses a 50 mm aluminum edgewise wound voice coil to improve linearity and input resistance. The magnetic circuit uses a low-mass, high-flux neodymium magnet, a center-pole-bent back plate with a high heat radiation effect, and a newly designed bucket-shaped frame with excellent transient characteristics to achieve high stability.<br><br>The high-pass band is equipped with 050 ti gold, a 2.5 cm dome tweeter.<br>The diaphragm uses an edge molded titanium diaphragm, and metal fatigue is reduced by a unique cold metal drawing method. This titanium diaphragm is plated with 24 gold along with the face plate, and smooth high-frequency characteristics are obtained by giving appropriate damping to the metal surface.<br><br>By setting the crossover frequency of the woofer and mid-range to 600 Hz in the network section, the frequency range of the vocal band is covered by the R screw and wide directivity is realized. The mid-range and tweeter have excellent characteristics with less peak / dip due to the slope characteristic of -18dB/oct.<br>High-quality network parts are used. LF (low-frequency) networks emphasize current characteristics and transient characteristics and use three types of small-capacity capacitors with different electrical characteristics and structures in parallel. MF-HF (medium-high frequency) networks use a combination of small-capacity capacitors in parallel / series and a charge-coupled linear definition system with DC bias applied to the capacitors. This enables class A operation of the capacitors to eliminate 0 cross distortion and improve sound quality and characteristics.<br>The LF and MF-HF networks are physically as well as electrically separated and arranged orthogonally on independent boards to minimize electromagnetic coupling between network circuits.<br><br>The enclosure uses a 19 mm thick body and 25 mm thick baffle MDF with a metal plate at the top of the baffle and rounded left and right sides to prevent diffuse sound reflection at the edges.<br>The exterior features a natural mahogany veneer finish on all six sides of the enclosure and a signature plate on the back of Greg Timbers, the Chief Systems Engineer who delivered the most representative JBL speakers, including the Everest, K2 and S2600/S3100, as proof of the JBL 50th anniversary model.<br><br>The front grill uses a metal frame grill with a plastic coating on a small-area steel bar, and acoustic interference of the grill is eliminated by attaching and detaching the floating structure.<br>In addition, the grill is designed to cover only woofer, mid-range and bass reflex ports. In order to ensure the directivity of the tweeter, the grill is also designed to be exposed as it is when attached.<br><br>The rear terminal is equipped with two types of speaker terminals, one for LF and the other for MF-HF the normal connection, bi-wiring and bi-amplifier connection are possible.<br><br>There was a dedicated channel divider DX1 as an option sold separately.<br>In combination with the DX-1, an active bi-amplifier configuration using the electronic debinding network circuit of the DX-1 allows further improvement of resolution and quality in the low frequency range.</p>
