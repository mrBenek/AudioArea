				<p class="detail">This is a 2.1 ch speaker system that uses Kusu timmass technology.<br><br>Bose&#39;s unique Kusu timam technology has been adopted, and a 2.1 channel configuration consisting of a base box and satellite speakers achieves both miniaturization and enhancement of the low-frequency range.<br><br><br><strong>Satellite speaker</strong><br><br>The satellite speakers are equipped with two 5.7 cm cone type full-range units for all bands and a 2.0 cm soft dome type tweeter for high-frequency support.<br><br>The satellite speakers are equipped with unique power radiation technology.<br>In concert halls and other places, not only direct sound but also indirect sound reflected on walls, ceilings, floors, etc. account for a significant portion of the actual sound. In Bose, we focused on the complex energy distribution of indirect sound, and found that it is best balanced when it arrives 8 to 80 ms behind the direct sound. We also found that the less the sound energy difference reflected from ceilings or sides, the more musical sound becomes. To satisfy these requirements, we used the computer software &quot;Array Cad&quot; developed in-house. By thoroughly verifying the angle of the baffle plate, spacing, phase, unit size, etc., unit layout is determined so as to obtain the radiation pattern of ideal acoustic energy.<br>On the 505 wb satellite speaker, two units are placed one above the other, facing slightly inward and outward, and a tweeter is installed between them to create a wide radiation area that provides uniform sound energy no matter where you hear it.<br>In addition, by placing a tweeter at the position where the radiation areas of the two units are synthesized and following the radiation pattern, the sound image is accurately positioned regardless of the position of the listener.<br><br>The cabinet structure provides an ideal acoustic energy radiation pattern without having to divide the cabinet into small upper and lower cabinets, increasing the cabinet capacity and the flexibility of the crossover point.<br>In addition, the 505 wb uses MDF made of 100% conifer for the cabinet material. It is 1.5 times harder than the conventionally commonly used particle board, and resonance is suppressed. Moreover, the effect of standing wave is suppressed by introducing the cabinet structure without parallel plane with the front baffle with unique angle.<br><br><br><strong>Base box</strong><br><br>The 505 wb basebox uses アクースティマス technology that Bose has completed after 15 years.<br>In this system, all sound energy is radiated through ports located in front and rear of the unit instead of directly playing back low sound as in the conventional woofer. This realizes low sound reproduction in a small unit. High frequency distortion, which causes coloring of sound, is filtered out, the sense of direction of sound source is eliminated, and sound quality and volume are not unbalanced no matter where it is placed. In addition, since the heavy low sound component of left and right speakers can be received by one base module, distortion due to interference of low sound can be eliminated.<br>The inside of the base box consists of separate rooms at the front and rear of the driver unit, each of which has a port with a different tuning frequency, and a third room at the outlet of this port also has a port.<br>In this method, all acoustic energy is emitted by the air mass of two ports with different tuning frequencies, so the maximum acoustic energy is obtained without moving the cone paper much. In addition, in the 3-chamber method, the acoustic energy of two ports is filtered by the second order filter of the third port, so that flat and high-efficient bass can be obtained over a wider band.<br>In addition, this structure enables extremely sharp cut-off between the low end and the high end, so the complex network eliminates peaks near the crossover between the middle and high end without increasing distortion.<br><br>The base box contains 2 16 cm cone type woofers.<br>A gasket is placed around the unit, and a rubber vibration isolator is used to fix the unit with screws to reduce the vibration of the cabinet itself.<br><br><br><strong>Other</strong><br><br>The top panel of the satellite speaker and the front panel of the base box have a UV paint finish with a bird&#39;s eye maple tone.<br><br>There were two types of speaker stands for satellite speakers.<br>The PS-15, the height can be adjusted in the range of 200 mm, and the cord can be passed through the pipe.<br><br>There was a stand for base box.</p>
