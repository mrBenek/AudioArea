				<p class="detail">TAD (Technical Audio Devices), which was launched in 1975, developed a high-end speaker system as the ultimate home use speaker for every environment, from conventional audio playback to playback of high-resolution formats such as DVD-Audio and SACD.<br><br>Led by Mr. Andruw Jones, a speaker engineer who has traveled between KEF and Infinity, an American R &amp; D center, a Pioneer TAD development team, and an international engineering team consisting of Tohoku Pioneer were formed. The Japanese TAD development team was in charge of the speaker unit, and Andruw Jones was in charge of the total coordination and speaker system.<br><br>Two 25 cm cone woofers are installed in the low range, and 20 cm cone woofer is installed in the middle and low range.<br>The newly developed OFGMS (Optimized Field Geometry Magnet Structure) magnetic circuit is used for the magnetic circuits of Woofer and Midbus. In order to eliminate the non-linear component caused by the magnetic circuit which remains slightly in the conventional short voice coil type magnetic circuit, the magnetic flux density in the magnetic circuit is made uniform by providing a slit in the plate located outside the voice coil.<br><br>It is equipped with 16 cm and 3.5 cm CST coaxial units for mid - and high-range and high-range.<br>The CST (Coherent Source Transducer) driver has a structure in which a mid-range cone designed to the optimum shape is placed in the director part in the directional control of the tweeter. This structure solves the response problem of phase and axis deviation of the conventional driver. In addition, by making the phase of the tweeter and mid-range the same, the sound is reproduced with the same sound balance over a wide band from the center of the CST in any direction axially symmetric.<br>The diaphragm is made of beryllium, which is also used in professional TADs. By using a vapor deposition method for manufacturing, the combination of particles realizes high rigidity and internal loss that are unthinkable for metals. The diaphragm resonance of the drive unit is pushed out of the audible reproduction band and the reproduction accuracy is improved.<br><br>The enclosure uses Structurally Inert Laminated Enclosure Technology (SILENT enclosure). Constructed from more than 50 individually fabricated layers of birch plywood, each part is rigorously designed to prevent standing waves in the cabinet, making it less susceptible to unwanted vibrations from Woofer reaction forces and sound pressure due to the lack of cabinet joints.<br>In addition, the ISO (Isolation) Drive technology has been introduced so that the top of the speaker with the CST is separated from the bottom of the speaker, which is the bass enclosure, and the CST itself is mounted to isolate vibration from the top enclosure, which fully insulates the CST driver from unwanted vibrations generated by the bass speakers and resonance of the cabinet.</p>
