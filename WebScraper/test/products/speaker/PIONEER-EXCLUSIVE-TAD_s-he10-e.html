				<p class="detail">Based on wave front control technology and high-speed technology, this speaker system was developed by introducing new high-sensitivity technology in order to realize more realistic sound field and sound image reproducibility.<br><br>Two 25 cm cone type woofers with ALCC (alginate composite cone) diaphragm are used for the low range.<br>This diaphragm is made of a mixture of alginic acid fiber to increase the bonding strength between high-strength polyarylate fiber and pulp. Alginic acid fiber extracted from seaweed such as kelp works as a binder for both, improving the bonding strength and obtaining high rigidity and internal loss.<br>The magnetic circuit uses a double anti-magnetic magnet with a canceling magnet and drives at a magnetic flux density of 14,300 Gauss. In addition, the T-shaped pole provides a symmetrical magnetic flux distribution and provides excellent power linearity even when the voice coil is large in amplitude.<br>The damper uses a butterfly type damper with low mechanical loss and air resistance and excellent initial motion sensitivity. Combined with a lightweight woofer diaphragm, this damper enables accurate responses even to minute inputs.<br><br>A horn type tweeter is used for the high frequency range.<br>The driver is equipped with a rear type compression driver.<br>This is the same system as the Technical Audio Devices (TAD) unit and Exclusive S5. The sound guided by the fading plug adjacent to the diaphragm is collected at the center of the outlet and emitted from the horn at once. This rear type has excellent phase and high-frequency characteristics because the length of the sound path is the same for each sound path.<br>The diaphragm is made of highly responsive 3 cm diameter titanium, and the back cover is made of aluminum die cast.<br>In addition, the horn section uses a newly designed slant angle oval wave horn that is integrally molded with the front port. When set to the front, the horn flare has an inclination of 10 degrees, and both L and R tweeters face inward respectively, so that more natural sound field and sound image localization can be obtained at the central listening point.<br>In addition, the horn has an oval shape with a soft curved surface, so that it has a wide horizontal directivity and a wider listening area for stereo playback.<br>The horn is made of aluminum die-cast with high rigidity and high molding accuracy to ensure vibration control so that the horn itself does not generate excessive vibration.<br><br>The network is distributed specifically for the unit for sound quality, and the network board is floating from the enclosure to avoid vibration.<br><br>A full midship mount is adopted to prevent vibration of the unit from being transmitted to the baffle.<br>Both the woofer and tweeter are firmly secured inside the enclosure to prevent unwanted vibration of the baffle.<br><br>The enclosure takes advantage of the bass reflex effect for higher efficiency and has ports on the front and rear baffles. In addition, ports are provided at the same position so that they pass through the front and rear baffles to disperse the anti-resonance of the port.<br>In addition, a large capacity enclosure (72L) is adopted to fully demonstrate the performance of the unit, and the depth is enlarged to improve the low-frequency characteristics.<br>In addition, by rounding the corner of the baffle to a large extent, the wavefront diffraction is controlled, thereby reducing the diffraction phenomenon.<br>The enclosure is made of high-density particle board with a Reed-Dark-Brown finish.</p>
