				<p class="detail">This is a G-series speaker system developed with the technology of advanced machines.<br><br>The PLUMB INLINE method is used to clarify the orientation of depth in addition to the orientation of right and left.<br>In this employs a unique layout in which the woofer is put forward based on a comprehensive judgment based on accumulated experiments on the shape, material and mounting position of the cone, thereby aligning the sound source position of each unit almost in a straight line.<br><br>In order to prevent the sound reflected on the baffle board from interfering with the direct sound, causing peaks and valleys at specific frequencies and sharp directional characteristics, we have adopted an Acoustic Grooved Board (AG). In the AG board, the longitudinal and lateral grooves have a diffuse effect that disperses reflected waves with high energy at specific frequencies, reducing interference with the direct sound and improving the sense of orientation.<br><br>In order to make the mid-range and tweeter as close as possible, they are integrated into a unit board, which improves the directional characteristics of the upper and lower directions.<br><br>A 25 cm cone type woofer using CARBOCON as a diaphragm is mounted in the low range.<br>In the SS-G3, we are working to enrich the corn paper itself by refining our know-how in the manufacturing stage of vibration panels and by introducing new approaches to the beater, carbon fiber blending method, and pressing method. In the shape of the SS-G7/SS-G5, a 60 ° straight cone with a half top angle is adopted based on the vibration analysis of NASTRAN. Corrugation with ribs is applied to increase the rigidity of the whole corn paper.<br>The edge is made of a cotton cloth that is light and strong and has a uniform mesh. Special damping agent is manually applied on top of the cotton cloth and aluminum die-cast is used for the frame.<br>An Alnico V cast magnet is used for the magnetic circuit. In addition, the pole is made of FC material with excellent strain characteristics, and these are housed in □ type yoke with less flux leakage. Furthermore, structurally, the pole is T-shaped so that the magnetic field becomes symmetrical with respect to the vibration direction, improving the magnetic flux density distribution, and effectively reducing the generation of asymmetric distortion and third harmonic distortion.<br><br>The mid-range is equipped with 8 cm cone type mid-range.<br>The center cap of this unit has been coated with a special damping agent to achieve smooth and simple characteristics.<br><br>A 5 cm cone type tweeter is installed in the high range.<br><br>In the inductor for the woofer in the network section, a 1.2 mm φ copper wire is wound around an oriented core with excellent has excellent distortion characteristics when subjected to Dainyu force, to limit the resistance value to less than 0.2 Ω. In addition, it is firmly fixed with special resins to prevent resonance between wires.<br>We have also adopted metallized film capacitors with low internal loss and excellent sound quality.<br><br>The enclosure has a sealed structure.<br>18 mm thick hard glass pine particle board is used for the front baffle, and 15 mm thick particle board is used for each surface. Each surface is firmly bonded to the sealing degree.</p>
