				<p class="detail">This flat speaker system is equivalent to the Middle Class of the audio flat panel series.<br><br>It employs a twin cabinet system developed through trial production of 80 test models and computer simulation using the finite element method.<br>Based on conventional acoustic theory, ideal low-frequency reproduction was impossible with a large-area diaphragm and a small-capacity cabinet, regardless of whether the closed-type or open-type method was used. In order to improve this, the twin-cabinet system has a sealed part and an open part in one cabinet. Structurally, the back surface of the diaphragm of the unit itself is divided into a sealed part and an open part. This reduces the rigidity of the cabinet compared to the case where all the diaphragms of the same area are sealed. The lowest resonance frequency (fo) of the system can be set low, and a large sound pressure can be obtained from a lower frequency. In the open part, the sound radiated to the back is radiated from the rear duct installed in the cabinet, so that the phase difference between the sound radiated to the front and back can be large, and the effect of preventing the sound pressure from decreasing due to the opposite phase is obtained.<br>In addition, since the AFP large-area diaphragm emits low sound waves in a flat wave-like shape, it is less likely to be adversely affected by indoor reflections, etc., and attenuation due to distance is also extremely small.<br><br>Four 30cmx80cm flat units are installed in the low range, and two 13cmx32cm flat units are installed in the middle and low range.<br>The diaphragm of these units has a multi-layered structure consisting of foamed mica (mica) with high internal loss and natural polymer (chitin). Chitin is a natural polymer contained in the outer skin of crustaceans such as crabs and shrimps. It has a structure very similar to cellulose, which is the main component of pulp. By adding a cross-linking agent and heating it during papermaking, it has acquired excellent physical properties of 1.2 times rigidity and 3 times internal loss compared to conventional ones. This chitin is also famous as a component of the wings of crickets and as a component of mold generated inside the sound organ of the famous violin Stradivarius. At the finishing stage of Stradivarius, varnish mixed with chitin is used.<br>Dyes used in traditional Japanese Aizome are used for the surface material of the diaphragm to prevent color fading and improve the durability of the diaphragm.<br>The Woofer and Midlow use a 4-point drive system devised by computer-aided 3-D analysis. By using four voice coils to drive the point that does not cause natural vibration of the diaphragm, resonance mode is eliminated and a wide band is achieved. This also enables a wide band of fo to 800 Hz in the Woofer.<br><br>Two 8 cm flat mid-range units are installed in the mid-range area.<br>Mica is used for the diaphragm, and by coating the surface with Japanese lacquer, unnecessary vibration of the diaphragm is suppressed.<br><br>Two 2.7 cm flat tweeters are installed in the high range.<br>By using mica for the diaphragm and diamond coating by CVD method, faithful reproduction up to high frequencies is possible.<br><br>LC-OFC (linear crystalline oxygen-free copper) is used for internal wiring of the network, wire for choke coil, and direct connection between network elements. In addition, each circuit from the woofer to the tweeter is separated to eliminate crosstalk.<br><br>The cabinet is designed to be as thin as 6.4 mm thick by extensive computer simulation.<br>The exterior has a mirror finish with black paint.<br><br>Uses a large gold-plated terminal to which extremely thick cords and 4 mm plugs can be connected.</p>
