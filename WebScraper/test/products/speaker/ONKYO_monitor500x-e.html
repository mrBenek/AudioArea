				<p class="detail">This is a speaker system developed in pursuit of high quality by putting all of the high rigidity / no resonance technology that Onkyo had obtained until then into a compact 2-way.<br><br>A 23 cm cone type woofer is installed in the low range.<br>The diaphragm is based on a two layer structure of pure cross carbon, which achieves both high rigidity and light weight through the development of fine carbon fibers. It is equipped with a non-resonance structure in which the half-apex angle is changed at the inner circumference of the cone. In addition, damping characteristics are improved by using a special polymer compound that ensures large internal loss in the binding material.<br>In addition, the edge material is made of engineering elastomer with excellent linearity, and by making it highly compliant, the reproduction limit in the low range is expanded downward.<br><br>A 2.5 cm dome type tweeter is installed in the high range.<br>The diaphragm is equipped with plasma carbonite titanium in pursuit of high rigidity, unifying the whole band with the same carbon material as the low band. Plaza Uma Carbonite titanium is a titanium base material that undergoes surface hardening treatment by the plasma method. It forms a three layer structure of high-hardness ceramicized titanium and carbonite part, and it obtains 6 times the hardness of pure titanium. Unlike the coating method, this plasma method cures the titanium base material itself, so there is almost no increase in the thickness or weight of the diaphragm. In addition, by installing a rib structure to improve the strength on the outer periphery of the diaphragm, the high-frequency resonance peak at 30 to 50 kHz outside the audible band is flattened, and the transient response within the audible band is improved.<br>In addition, the tweeter unit is vibrationally isolated from CFCs and baffles by using aluminum die-cast spacers and acoustic absorbers.<br><br>Both the woofer and tweeter are designed to prevent leakage of magnetic field lines by using a canceling magnet.<br><br>The network division not only separates the woofer circuit and the tweeter circuit, but also determines the network layout with the least crosstalk by making full use of magnetic flux distribution measuring equipment linked with a computer. In addition, the sense of sound field is improved by the concentrated one point grounding by incorporating the idea of strengthening the earth line obtained from the experience of amplifier circuit design.<br>The parts used are coils containing silicon steel plates with high saturation levels, capacitors for audio equipment, and OFC wiring materials.<br><br>The enclosure structure consists of a high-density, rigid particle-board cabinet with a resin concrete front baffle attached.<br>The resin concrete material has a high specific gravity and excellent strength, so that unwanted vibration from the unit caused by the reaction of the diaphragm operation can be suppressed to a low level, and the sound pressure radiation of the front baffle with a time delay harmful to audibility is reduced. In addition to the material advantage of high rigidity, the resin concrete can be processed to a precise shape of micron order, and a 4-sided round baffle composed of a combination of especially smooth curves is molded and adopted.<br>We have also introduced an insulated mounting system, a technology for eliminating resonance in the enclosure. The woofer unit is attached to a resin concrete front baffle, and the tweeter unit is screwed together with an aluminum die-cast spacer and an acoustic absorber (restraining damping material) to a particle-board sub-baffle inside the baffle, increasing the independence of vibration of the two speaker units.<br><br>There was a speaker stand exclusively for the Monitor500X sold separately.<br>Uses hard material and 1-leg structure that does not generate standing waves. In addition, it is equipped with 4 metal points on the side so that the height can be finely adjusted.</p>
