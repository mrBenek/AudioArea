				<p class="detail">A center speaker with a thin design that pursues the reproduction of realistic dialogue.<br><br>The unit is equipped with two 5.7 cm cone type full-range units specially designed for dialogue reproduction and two 5.7 cm cone type drivers for low band.<br>The front is equipped with two drivers designed with an emphasis on middle and high sound reproduction to achieve clear speech reproduction. In addition, the rear of the front driver is equipped with 2 drivers designed with an emphasis on low sound reproduction. This driver uses a strong magnet for low sound to avoid phase distortion with the front driver.<br><br>Each unit has an anti-magnetic design with a canceling magnet and shield can.<br><br>The unit layout employs an articulated array design with a unique angle that allows the middle and high sound emitted by the driver in front to draw an optimal radiation pattern, thereby improving the directivity.<br><br>The cabinet structure is equipped with an independently developed compound loading system.<br>In this system, the front chamber is sealed in order to transmit the vibration of the rear compound driver to the front driver and cause it to resonate. The vibration of the compound driver is coupled with the movement of the front driver, and resonance occurs with an extremely strong force near the resonance frequency, producing a powerful low sound. This reduces the volume of the enclosure previously required by approximately 30%.<br>It is designed to emit low-frequency energy from the rear of the driver through the left and right ports. The inside of the cabinet is completely isolated from the left and right sides. The left and right ports have exactly the same characteristics. Moreover, the opening of the port is gradually flared so that low-frequency energy is emitted smoothly, and turbulence in the opening is suppressed, enabling efficient low-frequency playback.<br><br>It is a compact size with a depth of 152 mm and a thickness of 84 mm so that it can be mounted on a CRT TV.<br>In addition, by making it a matte professional gray color, it is considered to match with TV without feeling uncomfortable.<br><br>Equipped with a smart protection circuit, a logic circuit composed of electronic components actively monitors the input signal, and when an input signal exceeding the allowable input is detected, the input signal is cut until there is no distortion component. The input signal is restored as soon as there is no distortion component.</p>
