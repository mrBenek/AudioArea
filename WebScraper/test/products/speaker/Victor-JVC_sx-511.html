				<p class="detail">A 3-way speaker system that uses Alnico for the magnetic circuit in the middle range.<br><br>A 31.5 cm cone woofer with a cross-carbon diaphragm is mounted in the low range.<br>In this unit, high-quality cross-carbon is laminated with high-internal loss sheets to obtain moderate internal loss in addition to the characteristics of cross-carbon.<br><br>Equipped with a 12.0 cm cone type squaker in the middle area.<br>The diaphragm of this unit is a hybrid structure using fine cross carbon and carbon sheet, and clear sound quality with less distortion is obtained.<br>The Alnico magnet is used for the magnetic circuit. It is an alloy made of nickel, cobalt, iron, and other materials. Compared to conventional ferrite magnets, it has a higher density and more uniform magnetic flux distribution. It has an electrical resistivity of 45 μ Ω cm, which is about 1/200 of that of conventional ferrite (10,000 μ Ω cm). Moreover, it has a small magneto-resistance of about 1/4, and the braking force is extremely high. Therefore, the back electromotive force of the voice coil is strongly cancelled out. In addition, the sound quality is improved by using a full-fledged tsubo-type yoke, which has less magneto-resistance than conventional rectangular yokes.<br><br>A 3.0 cm dome type tweeter is installed in the high range.<br>The diaphragm of this unit is made by depositing amorphous diamond on a titanium substrate using a unique chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method, and achieves sound velocity comparable to diamond.<br><br>The frame of each unit is made of solid aluminum die cast with rib structure to increase rigidity.<br>In particular, the weight class for the woofer is 2.1 kg, double that of the conventional model. Moreover, the front baffle, which tends to be less rigid, is reinforced with the frame by mounting it securely with 8 screws.<br><br>A three part network is used for the network section. High, middle, and low frequency circuits are separated to eliminate mutual interference. In addition, solderless caulking is used for the wiring connection section, and adhesive is used to completely seal the wiring connection section to prevent deterioration of sound quality due to aging.<br>High-sound condenser and coil are used for parts.<br><br>The cabinet uses a full-cleat system. The 25 mm thick front and rear baffles have a structure in which piles (cleat) are placed at all bonding points. In addition, a unique high-speed and high-pressure assembly method has been introduced for the assembly of the cabinet, and it is a sturdy structure in which all six surfaces are bonded instantly at a high pressure of approximately 1 ton. In this method, the bonding surface does not undergo heat treatment to weaken, so the aging is less.<br>Carefully selected high-density conifer wood is used for the material while realizing high strength, it realizes a cabinet with beautiful sound.<br><br>The unit layout adopts a sound intensity method in which the optimum mounting position is designed by a computer, and realizes a new G-line unit layout close to the ideal.<br>In addition, we have adopted a super elliptical baffle that radiates sound energy evenly to the listening room by improving directivity.</p>
