				<p class="detail">This speaker system was developed to reproduce as much information as possible from the actual performance of music without adding unnecessary things and without losing necessary things.<br><br>A 30 cm cone type unit is used for the low range.<br>With MDCT (Magnetic Reduction Technology) proposed by Onkyo, the magnetic strain generated in the magnetic circuit is reduced by improving the shape of the pole piece and top plate, and by adopting copper short rings and copper caps.<br>We have also adopted a short voice coil that further advances the concept of MDCT. This coil is designed with a larger magnetic circuit so that the voice coil always oscillates in a uniform magnetic flux density. Compared with a long voice coil, this coil has less distortion and differential operation under a constant electromagnetic brake, so that resolution is improved.<br>In order to transmit a large amount of information without leakage, 99.9999% ultra-high-purity oxygen-free copper (6N-OFC) is used for the voice coil winding.<br>Bio-Crocone, which was developed from biotechnology, is used for the diaphragm.<br>This diaphragm has improved various important characteristics for diaphragm such as light weight, high rigidity, high internal loss and high airtightness by refining and mixing ascidian cellulose, which is the most crystalline of natural cellulose, with dense wood pulp produced in high latitude areas near the Arctic.<br>We have newly developed and adopted High Legh Near Elastomer Edge for the edge material with excellent linearity.<br><br>An 8 cm dome type unit with an aluminum magnesium alloy diaphragm in which the diaphragm and voice coil bobbin are integrated is adopted for the middle area.<br>Since no adhesive is interposed between the vibration plate and bobbin, this integrated structure type has high follow-up capability to music signals. Moreover, the vibration system can be made lighter and more rigid, and high-resolution mid-range playback can be achieved.<br>The magnetic circuit is also equipped with MDCT technology to reduce magnetostriction.<br>In addition, the punching net made of magnetic material becomes a part of the magnetic circuit. In order to prevent the magnetic flux that should originally be concentrated in the magnetic gap from protruding to the front, causing interference with the AC magnetic flux generated when music signals are input, and causing distortion, a small high-performance samarium-cobalt magnet is attached to the punching net to prevent the magnetic flux from passing through the front of the diaphragm.<br>In addition, by sandwiching this cancel magnet with damping material, the squeal of punching net is suppressed.<br><br>A 2.5 cm dome unit with an integrated diaphragm and voice coil bobbin is used for the high frequency band as well as the middle band.<br>In addition, the material is aluminum magnesium alloy, which is approximately 25% lighter than conventional tweeters.<br>The magnetic circuit uses MDCT technology that uses copper short rings to improve resolution.<br><br>In order to bring out the quality of each unit in the network, carefully selected parts are used abundantly. In addition, each unit is divided into three bands to eliminate reciprocal induction.<br>In addition to the network parts, we have also taken anti-vibration measures to the wiring materials and placed them so that input signals are transmitted to each unit without deterioration.<br><br>The front baffle of the enclosure is made of hard-textured softwood MDF with 50 mm thickness on the front baffle and sides. In addition to the use of soundbars and elaborate reinforcement to increase the rigidity of the cabinet and adjust the sound.<br>The front baffle has a large round with a radius of 55 mm to reduce sound reflection and diffraction.<br>In addition, in order to prevent adverse effects on other units due to the reaction vibration of the vibration plate of each unit being transmitted from the magnetic circuit to the front baffle via the frame, a slit is provided between the fixed parts of each unit on the back surface of the front baffle, and an isolated mount method is adopted to resolve vibration interference between units.<br><br>Special speaker stand is sold separately.<br>This stand is made of laminated mizume cherry with excellent vibration damping characteristics, impregnated with special resins, and compressed and formed with high density under high sound and high pressure.<br>As a result, high rigidity and resonance rejection are obtained.</p>
