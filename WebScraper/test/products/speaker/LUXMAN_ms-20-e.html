				<p class="detail">This speaker system is based on the MS-10 and uses a multi-woofer system to expand the low-frequency range.<br><br>The multi-woofer method has been used to increase the sound pressure level in the low-frequency range by driving small-diameter woofers in parallel, giving them a sense of impact. However, this method has caused problems due to interference between units, such as degradation of sound image localization and intermodulation distortion due to the fluctuation of frequency characteristics and phase distortion in the high-frequency range of the woofer.<br>To solve this problem, in the MS-20, in order to prevent interference between two mid - and low-frequency units, a partition plate is placed in the enclosure to provide an independent space, and the volume ratio of each is set at 3 : 2. The fo (lowest resonance frequency) and Qo (height of the lowest resonance point) of the main and sub woofers are changed.<br>In addition, regarding the deterioration of sound localization due to phase distortion, consideration is given to the operation of the two woofers, such as the receiving band and attenuation characteristics. In particular, the network is examined from various angles, and the receiving band and attenuation characteristics are determined to solve the problem of sense of localization. For this reason, the main woofer covers the range from 45 Hz to 3 kHz, and the sub woofer is set to be 6 dB lower than the sound pressure level of the main woofer at the maximum point (250 Hz). With a special filter, the sound is received up to 3 kHz while being gradually attenuated at a slope of -3dB/oct. In addition, in order to reproduce clearly the band from 50 Hz to 500 Hz, which is the base of sound localization, we fine-tune the multi-network in which the main woofer and sub woofer are independent.<br><br>A 20 cm cone type woofer C-2038K, which is also used in the MS-10, is used for the middle and low frequencies.<br>This unit uses an aramid fiber-based plastic cone made of two or more composite materials for the diaphragm, making it lighter and more rigid, and reducing the sound inherent to the material.<br><br>A 2.5 cm dome type tweeter D-2501F, which is also used in the MS-10, is used for the high-frequency band.<br>The diaphragm is a 25 mm diameter semi-hard dome type made of polyester film as a base and has excellent directional characteristics. It is also made of the same plastic material with an emphasis on connection with the middle and low frequency units.<br><br>The network uses a coil made of a core material with a low distortion factor, a film type condenser with excellent mid - and long-range characteristics, and a lead-insertion type speaker cable.<br>In addition, in the layout of network parts, sufficient distance between coils is taken to avoid interference between the parts to improve sound quality.<br><br>The enclosure uses a multi-vent tuning method.<br>This system is based on a sealed enclosure (cabinet) with several small holes in the rear of the box to reduce the air pressure in the box to the optimum condition.<br>This eliminates excessive pressure on the cone and realizes excellent transient characteristics.</p>
