				<p class="detail">Through theoretical analysis and hearing, the correlation between noise and audibility and the mechanism of generation were thoroughly verified, and Onkyo&#39;s technology and sensitivity were put into the center speaker to increase sound field reproduction capability.<br><br>It has two 20 cm cone woofers in the low range and a 13 cm cone in the middle range.<br>These units use silk OMF diaphragms. These diaphragms are molded with a matrix structure of 100% pure non-woven fabric made of ultra-fine silk fibers and unsaturated polyester resin, and the inherent energy generated by vibration of the diaphragm is quickly converted into thermal energy by friction between fibers and layers. Unsaturated polyester also has a large internal loss and is carefully selected with high rigidity. As a result, the entire diaphragm is lightweight, has high rigidity, and has high internal loss.<br>For the edge and damper supporting the diaphragm, materials with low intrinsic noise are carefully selected, and the shape that minimizes vibration energy loss at the practical sound volume is selected. In addition, the newly developed S-line edge is also used for the connection between the diaphragm and the edge to smooth the connection, greatly reducing reflection of propagating waves.<br><br>A 2.5 cm hard dome type tweeter using an aluminum magnesium alloy diaphragm is mounted in the high frequency range.<br>Among metals, aluminum magnesium alloy, which is lightweight and has less natural resonance, is used for the diaphragm and voice coil, which require high-speed vibration. Moreover, the diaphragm and voice coil are made into an integrated structure that does not use any adhesive to improve response characteristics.<br>In addition, the front protective net that protects the diaphragm is made of non-magnetic material to prevent degradation of sound quality, thereby eliminating various factors that cause loss of sound information in detail.<br><br>The magnetic circuit has a shape and structure that enhances the symmetry of magnetic flux and prevents interference of AC and DC magnetic fields.<br>The adoption of M. D. C. T. (magnetic strain reduction technology) makes it possible to reduce non-linear strain, magnetic strain and current strain as much as possible.<br><br>In the network section, the boards are separated for each sound range that each unit has, and the layout is separated to prevent mutual interference due to electromagnetic induction. In addition, the ground, which is the reference of audio signals, employs an S. G. L. (Steady Ground Level) type one point concentrated circuit to prevent current from flowing in the ground line.<br>In addition, high-quality parts such as film condensers made by WIMA (Germany) are used for network elements, and damping cloth wound cables that are less susceptible to vibration are used for internal wiring.<br><br>The enclosure is designed to have a trapezoidal shape that is less susceptible to standing waves, and uses a diffusion material instead of a sound absorbing material to disperse energy, thereby preventing the occurrence of standing waves.<br>In addition, MDF material is used for the material, and the thickness of the baffle board, which is affected by the vibration of the speaker unit, is maintained at 42 mm. In addition, the structure is three divided with two horizontal reinforcing plates for higher rigidity and dispersion / reduction of resonance.<br>A 5-liter back chamber is installed at the rear of the squaker to eliminate the influence of back pressure from other units.<br>Exterior finished with Cherrywood Glossy Paint.<br><br>The speaker terminal uses a gold-plated brass terminal for banana banana plugs. A hole of 6 mm diameter is provided in the terminal shaft to support extremely thick speaker cables.</p>
