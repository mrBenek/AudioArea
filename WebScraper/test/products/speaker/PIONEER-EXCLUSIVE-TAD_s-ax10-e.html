				<p class="detail">This speaker system was developed as a new-generation reference for high-definition media such as DVD audio by applying the technology and experience accumulated in the past.<br><br>This speaker uses AFAST (Acoustic Filter Assisted System Tuning) technology.<br>By using an acoustic tube in the enclosure and in the horn opening, it suppresses unnecessary box ringing by absorbing standing waves and resonance sound, and eliminates unstable back and forth movement of sound image due to fluctuation of pitch (sound height), thus enhancing clear reproducibility.<br><br>A 25 cm cone type woofer is installed in the low range.<br>The diaphragm is made of cone paper equivalent to the TAD unit which is well known as a studio monitor speaker. It is mixed with Kevlar and subjected to aging treatment so that the sound quality is sufficiently tuned.<br><br>A 3 cm compression driver and an AFAST horn are installed in the high range.<br>The compression driver is a high-efficiency design incorporating TAD design know-how. It uses a lightweight and highly rigid 3 cm edge-wise voice coil to reproduce sound with excellent response.<br>In addition, AFAST technology has been introduced into the horn, and by mixing copper powder, both strength and internal loss are increased, and resonance is suppressed by increasing weight.<br><br>A ribbon-type super-tweeter has been newly developed and installed in order to reproduce the ultra-high frequency range that DVD audio enables.<br>By adopting a magnetic circuit using neodymium magnet and aluminum ribbon, it is possible to reproduce ultra-high frequency range up to 120 khz with high efficiency.<br><br>Each unit is fixed from the rear of the enclosure to provide high resolution and high dynamic range.<br><br>In the network section, high-quality sound parts are used for wiring cords, choke coils, capacitors, and terminals, and a dividing network is used to reduce loss and leakage. Special attention is paid to paid to the phase characteristics between units to achieve smoothness as a system.<br>It is also equipped with switching terminals for bi-wiring connection, bi-amplifier connection and multi-amplifier drive.<br><br>Equipped with 3-position switching type level control for tweeter.<br><br>It is designed in pursuit of the ideal speaker system of &quot;the enclosure does not sound but only the diaphragm&quot;.<br>First of all, strength is improved by adopting a trapezoidal structure, and in addition, unnecessary resonance is suppressed by a three layer structure sandwiching special damping material.<br>In addition, acoustic tubes based on AFAST technology, a further development of Pioneer&#39;s TAD professional studio monitor technology, are placed inside the enclosure to significantly reduce the amount of sound absorbing material and eliminate the generation of standing waves, which has been considered a weak point of the tall boy type (patent pending).<br>In addition, it has a separate structure with a trapezoidal enclosure divided into upper and lower parts, a special ceramic speaker base weighing 24 kg, and a round form method.<br>The bass reflex structure provides sound paths in all directions from the lower part of the enclosure and dimples on the base for natural low sound reproduction.</p>
