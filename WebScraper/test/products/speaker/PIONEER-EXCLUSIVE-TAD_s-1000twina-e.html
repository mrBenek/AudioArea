				<p class="detail">While inheriting the charm of S-1000twin, this speaker system was developed with S-5000 technology in pursuit of higher perfection.<br><br>Two 20 cm cone type woofers are used for the low range.<br>The diaphragm uses ALCC (alginic acid composite cone), which is made by mixing alginic acid fiber in order to increase the bonding force between high rigidity material (carbon fiber, aramid fiber, etc.) and pulp.<br>Alginic acid fiber is made from alginic acid extracted from seaweed into filament fiber. This fiber is used as a binder for high rigidity material and pulp, and by increasing the bonding force, high rigidity and high internal loss are improved.<br>In addition, the S-1000twinA is mixed with polyarylate fiber, which has excellent shock absorption power as a high-rigidity material, and the reaction of the woofer diaphragm is improved.<br>In addition, the voice coil adopts an edgewise winding with ribbon wire, and the coil occupancy rate in the magnetic gap is high, so the driving force of the cone is improved by approximately 10% compared to conventional products.<br>An alnico magnet is used for the magnetic circuit, and a copper short ring is added to prevent magnetic materials such as poles and plates in the vicinity from being magnetized, thereby suppressing distortion.<br>In addition, the top of the center cap is equipped with a CRA (Cap Resonance Absorber) made by Exenes to reduce surface noise on the center cap surface. The frame is made of zinc die-cast, which has a specific gravity 2.6 times that of aluminum, to reduce unnecessary vibration.<br><br>A 3-cm dome tweeter is used for the high range.<br>The diaphragm uses a ceramic graphite diaphragm with a carbon purity of 99.99%, which is driven by an alnico magnet and an OFC edgewise wound voice coil.<br>In addition, in order to increase the bonding strength between the top plate and the flange, the top plate is cut to improve the flatness.<br>On the front, we have adopted a W. F. (wave front) director developed from wave front control technology. This W. F. director is made by Painted maple laminate carving which is also used in Exclusive S5. By adjusting the time axis with the woofer and controlling the directivity by the horn shape, the wave front of the sound at the listening position of the listener is matched.<br><br>The enclosure is a vertical twin system in which two woofers are arranged vertically with a tweeter at the center.<br>Wave-front control technology was introduced in the design. By strictly controlling the energy time of the woofer and the tweeter on the time axis, controlling the directivity of the woofer and the tweeter, controlling the directivity of the woofer and the tweeter, matching the electrical phase of the network, and controlling the wave-front diffraction by the shape of the baffle, we aim to realize a more ideal speaker system.<br>A midship mount system is used to fix the unit. Both the woofer and tweeter are fixed to the inner baffle inside the enclosure to reduce unnecessary vibration. In addition, a floating top and shield frame are used to eliminate resonance.<br>Artificial leather is applied to the baffle surface to improve the S/N feeling of sound quality.<br><br>The rear duct is used to avoid unnecessary radiation sound in the middle region from the duct.<br><br>The enclosure is finished with walnut real wood veneer with oil stain finish, and the top plate uses bird&#39;s eye maple.<br>The RUNNET uses a new 2-color woven fabric.</p>
