				<p class="detail">Based on the know-how accumulated through research, development and production of speakers, the Quest Series speaker system is based on Onkyo&#39;s concept of &quot;enjoying music with truly good sound&quot;.<br><br>The magnetic circuit uses MDCT (Magnetic Distortion Cancel Technology). The new shape and structure of the magnetic circuit enhances the symmetry of magnetic flux and successfully prevents the interference of direct and alternating magnetic fields.<br><br>In addition, the MID4 concept has been introduced to achieve more natural sound quality by not allowing crossover in the frequency band between 125 Hz and 2000 Hz.<br><br>For the low range, 18 cm cone type woofer is used.<br>The Woofer diaphragm is made of Bio-Croscone, a blend of ascidian cellulose derived from biotechnology. In order to bring out the performance of this diaphragm, a newly designed magnetic circuit using MDCT is adopted to reduce current distortion and improve the rise response characteristics of the diaphragm.<br>In addition, the newly adopted brass machined pole phase equalizer realizes a smooth middle and high frequency range without the effect of the shape of the diaphragm and the &quot;hollow effect&quot; or &quot;cavity resonance&quot; caused by the voice coil bobbin, and efficiently radiates heat generated in the voice coil.<br><br>A 2.5 cm dome type tweeter is used for the high range.<br>An even lighter aluminum-magnesium alloy has been developed for the diaphragm, and we have succeeded in reducing the weight by 25% compared with conventional products.<br>In addition, a copper short ring is used for the magnetic circuit to reduce distortion.<br><br>The enclosure distributes standing waves generated within it by means of tapered side walls and internal soundbars.<br>In addition, an isolated mount system has been introduced. In order to prevent the reaction vibration of the diaphragm moved by the music signal from being transmitted from the magnetic circuit through the frame to the baffle plate and adversely affecting it, a slit is provided between the units to suppress the vibration transmitted through the baffle plate.<br>In addition, an acoustic stabilizer is directly connected to the magnetic circuit of the woofer to absorb unwanted vibrations of the unit itself and vibrations caused by the reaction of the woofer diaphragm.<br><br>It uses a gold plated terminal for banana plug which can be connected by bi-wiring.<br><br>The special stand sold separately has a veneer finish with walnut single material (solid wood) at both ends of the base part.<br>The top plate is a &quot;restraint damping structure&quot; with a 3 mm thick steel plate sandwiched with damping material to suppress unnecessary noise. In addition, two 50 mm square steel pipes are sandwiched between side plates (thrust plate finish) from both sides of the support part to suppress the swing of the support part.<br>In addition, 4 round rivets can be attached to the back side of the base, and the back 2 of them are adjustable in height.</p>
