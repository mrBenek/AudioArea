				<p class="detail">This is a speaker system that improves quality based on the S 955 and pursues perfection in a higher dimension.<br><br>A 36 cm cone type woofer is installed in the low range.<br>In addition to the long voice coil design of the S-955 with excellent linearity at large amplitude, the newly developed dynamic response suspension is adopted for the support mechanism. The double Ayaori damper with excellent amplitude linearity completely eliminates mechanical loss. In addition, the breathability is improved to increase sound noise and resolution.<br><br>The mid-range features a 6.5 cm beryllium dome mid-range.<br>This unit uses a new precision technology that drives the magnetic circuit and voice coil down to micron order to reduce distortion and increase sensitivity. In addition, by using a new glass-reinforced polyimide resin laminate as the material for the voice coil bobbin, high heat resistance and high elasticity are realized, and input resistance is improved by more than 50%.<br>A pure beryllium diaphragm is used for the diaphragm. It is supported by a wire suspension made of beryllium copper wire, which is a traditional technology of Pioneer, and by a center tangential edge, so that stable amplitude characteristics can be obtained even at large amplitude, and unnecessary sound radiation from the edge is also eliminated.<br>In addition, it uses a direct radiator system with the dome top cut off, improving the sound connection with the tweeter and woofer, and realizing a dynamic mid-range with a core.<br><br>A beryllium ribbon type tweeter equivalent to the PT-R7III is installed in the high-frequency range.<br>The adoption of lightweight and highly rigid beryllium for the ribbon diaphragm expands the piston motion motor cortex range and improves the wide-area response.<br><br>The network section is designed to analyze the results of the trial listening by the engineer&#39;s ears and draw out the characteristics of the unit.<br>A balanced network circuit (PAT. P) that absorbs the back electromotive force of the woofer and prevents leakage from the earth line is adopted aiming at high resolution over the whole band.<br>In addition, we have carefully examined the circuit structure, elements, and layout to ensure low loss and low crosstalk. For example, we have separated the circuit for the woofer and adopted a newly developed condenser that provides superior resolution and sound field, and used oxygen-free copper wire LI (low inductance) cords JC-202 and JC-201 for internal wiring.<br><br>The enclosure is made of high-density, high-rigidity, high-loss Apiton plywood. By utilizing processing technologies such as Lock-Miter joints, resonance and distortion that interfere with sound quality are greatly reduced. In addition to the latest technologies for all units, careful consideration has been given to duct tuning to improve low sound reproduction.<br>The exterior is a Maples Ebony finish.</p>
