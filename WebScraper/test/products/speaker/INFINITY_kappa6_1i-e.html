				<p class="detail">This is a speaker system made with technology developed in the New Kappa series.<br><br>A 20 cm cone type woofer by IMG cone is mounted in the low range.<br>This IMG cone is made of a composite material of graphite fiber and polypropylene. It is molded under high pressure (injection molding) with high sound frequency. The graphite fibers are arranged radially from the center to the outer circumference, so that the non-deformation operating region of the cone is large and there is no breakup of the cone.<br>In addition, it uses a specially designed Kirby linear cone (adding strength to the piston during motion) and a newly designed inverted dust cap to increase the strength, minimizing the deformation of the cone even under high power conditions.<br>The Kappa6.1i is lighter and stiffer than conventional IMG cones (10% lighter and 5% harder than conventional cones).<br>Φ 133x19mm magnet and cotton thread wire are used for the magnetic circuit.<br><br>The middle section is equipped with a 7.6 cm poly dome type unit that uses a diaphragm that inherits the technology of the first Kappa series.<br>This diaphragm is a newly developed ultra-thin film (0.3 mm) made of soft polypropylene composite. In addition, an aluminum mesh diffuser is attached to the dome rear surface. By this diffuser, the disturbance of frequency characteristics due to the rear surface wave is suppressed without applying any additional force to the diaphragm, and flat frequency characteristics and low distortion are achieved.<br>Furthermore, the acoustic energy radiated to the back surface of the dome is guided from the center of the magnetic circuit with a special structure to the back cavity, eliminating the influence of back sound pressure.<br>This polydome drives a low Q dome-shaped diaphragm from the dome periphery by a large diameter edge-wound voice coil.<br><br>A plane drive type EMIT-R tweeter with a circular diaphragm is mounted in the high range.<br>The flat diaphragm of the EMIT-R tweeter uses an ultra-thin KAPTON film. An annular voice coil is photo-etched on its surface to form a vibration film, which is combined with a magnetic circuit of a special shape to directly drive the diaphragm.<br>As a result, flat frequency characteristics and wide-directional characteristics are obtained.<br><br>The network is designed by a computer using the MLSSA FET program, and the operating range of each speaker unit is determined. In addition, real-time fine-tuning is performed in an anechoic room, and finally, many audition experiments are repeated in the same room as the actual home environment.<br>In addition, individual components such as capacitors, resistors, and coils are carefully selected through subjective listening experiments, and extra-thick monster cable of Infiniti special specification is used for internal wiring.<br><br>It is bi-amped and has level adjustment for middle and high sound.<br><br>To minimize the effects of internal standing waves, the enclosure uses a column-shaped polygonal cabinet with 26.5 mm thick baffle material, natural wood solid oak, and oak-plated board.<br>A bass reflex duct is located at the bottom of the rear of the enclosure with removable spikes for bass and room tuning.<br><br>There was also the Black Oak model as an order model.</p>
