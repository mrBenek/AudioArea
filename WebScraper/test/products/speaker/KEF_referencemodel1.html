				<p class="detail">A toll-boy type speaker system that adopts UNI-Q driver and SCC system.<br><br>The low-frequency band adopts the SCC (Single Coupled Cavity) system, an original interport bus system.<br>This system is the basic form of the TCC system adopted in Reference Model 2, Model 3 and Model 4. In Reference Model1, a cavity and a 16 cm pulp cone type woofer B160 are placed in the lower part of the cabinet, and the interport for tuning the frequency is grounded so that a straight and slightly low sound can be obtained.<br><br>16 cmUNI Q driver, KEF&#39;s unique coaxial type unit, is installed in the middle and high frequency ranges.<br>This unit uses MB160 for the cone woofer and NT25 for the soft dome tweeter. In addition to the coaxial structure, the diaphragm is positioned at the same point in the depth direction so that the center of the sound is completely overlapped. This realizes a single sound source that matches in all points of time, space, and directivity. In order to realize this structure, the Tweeter NT25 uses neodymium iron boron, which has 10 times the magnetic force of ferrite, and succeeded in miniaturization of the magnetic circuit.<br>In the new reference series, pure silk is used for the tweeter diaphragm to improve sound connection.<br><br>The network section is designed based on an original computer data analysis.<br>In addition, oxygen-free copper wire is used for the wiring material to enable high-purity transmission.<br><br>The UNI-Q driver is laid out on the upper part to prevent the influence of the baffle surface from interfering with the sound field spreading. This reduces distortion and improves sound spread, sound field feeling and phase characteristics.<br>In addition, in order to reduce the influence of mutual interference between units and unnecessary vibration from the outside, a new material HDSP (High Density Structural Polymer) is used for the baffle surface, which is excellent in vibration control and has very dead acoustic characteristics. Moreover, for this material, each unit is semi-floating processed with vibration absorbing rubber material between them, and the screw stopper is decoupled structure with vibration absorbing material to eliminate the influence of cabinet vibration.<br>In addition, considering the effect of the edge of the speaker on sound, the whole is finished in a streamlined ergo design.<br><br>The bottom of the cabinet uses the same HDSP as the material used to fix the speaker unit, so as to stabilize the whole system and eliminate interference to sound caused by external vibration.<br>The exterior features a Rosetta Bar Finish featuring Italian-style wood grain.<br><br>The rear terminal is made of strong brass cast into a mold and gold-plated.<br>You can also use a banana plug for bi-wiring and bi-amplifier.<br><br>The legs are equipped with a gold-plated brass insulator.<br>In addition, the core of the legs can be inverted to form spikes, and the length can be adjusted according to the condition of the floor surface.<br><br>The left and right characteristics are strictly controlled and tuned from the stage of the unit, and the error is kept within ± 0.5 db.<br>In addition, each speaker is managed and manufactured by a single skilled worker from the selection of materials, processing, assembly, soldering, wiring, and product inspection. All the work is done manually to achieve high quality.</p>
