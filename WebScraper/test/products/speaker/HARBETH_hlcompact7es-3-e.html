				<p class="detail">This is a speaker system that was created by flash-up to further enhance the perfection of the HLCompact 7ES-2.<br><br>A 20 cm cone type woofer is installed in the low range.<br>This unit uses the RADIAL2 technology, which is an improved version of the RADIAL technology used in the L-Compact7ES-2.<br>At RADIAL, various problems on the cone surface in each frequency band were reduced by introducing special molding equipment and by changing the blend from the center to the periphery of several types of polymers with optimum characteristics for each frequency band based on lightweight but robust polypropylene.<br>In order to maximize its performance, the RADIAL2 uses a soft and contractible edge. The sound does not become distorted even when the piston motion is large, resulting in a flatter and more natural performance. In particular, linearity is improved at high power input. This reduces the reflection from the edge back to the voice coil, smoothes the high-band reproducibility of the unit, and allows for finer mid-range playback.<br><br>A 2.5 cm diameter aluminum hard dome type tweeter is installed in the high range.<br>By applying magnetic oil, it is subjected to ferrofluid cooling treatment which can maintain stable regeneration ability even in high temperature, and by using synthetic resin for the edge, more accurate reproducibility is obtained.<br>In addition, the newly designed Open Weave Grill improves the energy and spaciousness of the high-frequency range.<br><br>The network section has been redesigned with a newly introduced computer design system. The final sound is determined by listening tests conducted by the ears of the designer Alan Shaw. The design emphasizes not only data but also audibility.<br><br>The enclosure uses a unique design technology, SuperTunedStructure, which is based on computer analysis of sound behavior in the enclosure and optimizes response tuning of the enclosure using thin wood to improve sound quality.<br>In addition, we aim to further improve the transit characteristics by dampening with bitumen (bitumen system) instead of bracing for internal reinforcement of wood.<br>In addition, by setting the bass reflex port longer, the resonance frequencies of the port are lowered, the response in the low range is improved, and the power feeling in the middle range is improved. In addition, a round baffle for reducing the sound wave diffraction at the baffle end and SuperGrille&#39;s method for optimizing sound wave propagation by embedding a jersey grill in the front baffle are also adopted.<br><br>The input terminal is not a by-wire connection specification but a single connection specification for gold-plated banana plug.</p>
