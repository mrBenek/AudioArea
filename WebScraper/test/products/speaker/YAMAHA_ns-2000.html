				<p class="detail">With the convergence of speaker technology in the background, this speaker system was developed with the goal of producing sound that is musically mature and moving as a reproduction art.<br><br>It is equipped with JA 3301 which is a 33 cm cone type woofer in the low range.<br>This is the first time for Yamaha to use a paper-free pure carbon fiber cone produced Shinkai. This diaphragm uses a method in which unidirectional carbon fiber sheets are arranged radially in the shape of eight fan-shaped parts of a woofer, and a special resin is used as a matrix for molding. The shape of the diaphragm is a straight conical type, making the most of the tensile and compressive strength in the fiber direction and increasing the rigidity of the woofer as a whole. In addition, a bent part is provided on the outer circumference of the diaphragm and a rib is provided on the back side of the cone to strengthen the rigidity in the circumferential direction.<br>The magnetic circuit employs a newly designed magnetic circuit that calculates the magnetic flux distribution using the finite element method and minimizes the distortion component of the driving force acting on the voice coil. The magnet uses a ferrite magnet of 180 φ -100 φ -20t. The magnetic flux density is 11,350 gauss and the total magnetic flux is 220,000 maxwell. The voice coil uses a oxygen-free copper wire and employs an 88 φ edgewise wound voice coil.<br>In addition, urethane foam roll edges are used for the edges, and the dampers that support the vibration system are made of materials and impregnated materials with sufficient consideration.<br>In addition, special aluminum alloy is used for the frame.<br><br>In the middle area, it is equipped with JA 0802 a which is a 8.8 cm hard dome type squaker.<br>The diaphragm is made of pure beryllium, which is molded by a proprietary system using the electron-beam vacuum deposition method used in LSI manufacturing technology. The NS 2000 has succeeded in manufacturing a diaphragm with even finer particles than conventional beryllium. This diaphragm has improved directional characteristics by having a shape with a small radius of curvature. The resulting valley caused by interference in the out-of-band on-axis characteristics is suppressed by using a diffuser.<br>In addition, the voice coil uses an edgewise wound oxygen-free copper ribbon wire, and the edge uses a tangential edge made of a special fiber with double coating of viscoelastic and thermo-setting resins linearity.<br>The magnetic circuit uses a ferrite magnet of 156 φ -80 φ -25tmm, and the magnetic flux density is 18,400 gauss and the total magnetic flux is 150,000 maxwell.<br><br>A 3 cm hard dome type tweeter, JA 0526 a is mounted in the high range.<br>The diaphragm is made of pure beryllium as well as the mid-range diaphragm. It is compact and lightweight with a diameter of 23 mm and weight of 0.028g to achieve playback beyond the audible band. In addition, an acoustic diffuser is mounted on the front of the diaphragm to improve the high-range frequency characteristics and directivity.<br>The bobbin is made of special kraft paper with excellent durability. It is reinforced by edgewise winding of lightweight high-purity copper-clad aluminum ribbon wire. It is supported by the tangential edge of special fiber with double coating of viscoelastic resin and thermosetting resin. The diaphragm is tapered at the center pole of the space after the diaphragm and the space is filled with sound absorbing material to minimize the adverse effect of resonance on sound.<br>A ferrite magnet of 100 φ -50 φ -22tmm is adopted for the magnetic circuit to obtain a magnetic flux density of 18,800 gauss and a total magnetic flux of 34,000 maxwell.<br><br>The network consists of a large ferrite core, an inductor using oxygen-free copper wires, and an all-MP capacitor.<br>Oxygen-free copper wires are used for all internal wiring, and the wires themselves are fused one by one to stop the squeal.<br><br>The Squaker and Tweeter are equipped with continuously variable level control.<br>The attenuator used has a sufficiently large allowable input with little degradation in sound quality.<br><br>In the NS 2000, the speaker units are arranged in a vertical row in the center of the baffle surface, so that the directivity pattern in the horizontal plane is equal on the left and right sides, and the diffraction phenomenon of sound waves is suppressed by making the left and right ends of the baffle a round baffle with a curved surface.<br>The neclosure is a fully enclosed structure with an inner volume of 80L. The entire surface is a high-density party board 25 mm thick. Around the round baffle, solid beech is used. The strength is increased by the use of reinforcing bars and a large amount of angle block. The enclosure is designed using modal analysis to increase the strength balance of each part.<br>Finished with an American Walnut open pore finish.</p>
