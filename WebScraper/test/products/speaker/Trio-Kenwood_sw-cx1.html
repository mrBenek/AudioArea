				<p class="detail">An active subwoofer developed as a super woofer that plays back the ultimate ultra low range without ambiguity.<br><br>In order to fix the vibration ground completely and to clarify the vibration reference point, it is designed as a weight class with a total weight of 126.7 kg (including the amplifier / speaker unit).<br>As a result, the housing is not affected by the standing wave from the unit and is not affected by vibration.<br><br>33 cm cone type woofer is used in the unit.<br>In order to withstand the large amplitude (stroke) required for ultra-low frequency reproduction, the diaphragm uses a straight cone made of 3-layer carbon fiber of 3,000 filler plain weave, which is lightweight and highly rigid. In addition to the chamber made of the same material, made of the same material.<br>The magnetic circuit uses strontium ferrite as the main magnet with a diameter of 140 mm, and the rear part uses a double magnet system with a diameter of 110 mm. In addition, the circuit is closed with a 2 mm thick cover to increase the magnetic flux density and provide a high anti-magnetic effect. In addition, the cover part is coated to reduce cover squeal caused by vibration at the time of large input.<br>The damper uses Conex, a heat-resistant polymer fiber, and a double damper system is adopted to further improve dubbing performance and anti-rolling performance.<br>An aluminum die-cast frame is used for the frame to improve vibration isolation and vibration system support strength. In addition, by arranging ribs asymmetrically, unnecessary vibration is eliminated from both directions of material and shape.<br>Urethane elastomer is used for the edge to improve linearity.<br><br>The voice coil bobbin is made of heat-resistant, hard-to-burn, highly rigid polyimide reinforced with glass fiber material.<br>In order to further increase the bobbin strength, Vectran (a trademark of Kuraray Co., Ltd.), a new high-strength heat-resistant polyarylate fiber, is wound with high tension (filament winding) to ensure sufficient strength (10 times). In addition, the voice coil is wound with four layers to enable faithful operation even for large inputs.<br><br>Based on the concept of full-scale ultra-low-frequency reproduction, we have adopted a direct-radiation-type reproduction method for low-frequency reproduction that has a low low-frequency reproduction limit and excellent phase characteristics.<br>The enclosure has an internal volume of 52 liters and is large enough for a 33 cm screwdriver. It also has a structure (reflector base) that reduces unnecessary high-frequency components by reflecting the sound emitted from the speaker on the bottom surface once, taking advantage of the merits of the direct radiation method.<br><br>The newly developed NF ceramic enclosure is used for the enclosure.<br>Unlike ordinary fine ceramics, NF Ceramics is a new structural ceramic that is not fired at high temperatures and is produced by chemical bonding using water as a medium. By using NF Ceramics in the enclosure, we have achieved five times the strength, four times the damping capacity, three times the density, three times the density, excellent dimensional accuracy, freedom of shape, and heat, water, and weather resistance.<br><br>The enclosure structure takes advantage of the moldability of NF ceramics and adopts a 3-piece structure that takes into consideration the vibration of each part. This structure is designed with high precision so that the original performance can be obtained without adjustment by simply stacking.<br><br>The enclosure also features round-shaped port ducts and a tapered base that prevents standing waves between the baffle and the base and concentrates radiant energy toward the front.<br><br>The amplifier section has a differential 2-stage parallel push-pull circuit configuration for low-impedance drive and high-gain operation. In addition, it uses a 7,500 μ F Chemicon and a high-capacity transformer.<br>In addition, a large black anodized aluminum heat sink has been adopted to enhance the heat radiation effect at high output, and the casing has a highly rigid double-bridge structure to completely eliminate vibration and external influence.<br><br>It is equipped with a phase selector switch that enables phase switching to match the amplitude period of the sound waves of the subwoofer and the main speaker.<br><br>Equipped with a turnover switch, it is possible to switch the most effective turnover point (5 points) selected from the results of simulating various speakers.<br>In addition, the cutoff slope is set to a curve of -18dB/oct taking into account the phase.<br><br>The speaker input terminal / Low/High speaker input level can be switched, and connection can be made by two way speaker cable and audio cord.<br>In addition, two or more units of the SW-CX1 can be used by installing a monaural in-out along with the line input.<br><br>High-purity OFC is used for the wiring of the amplifier and speaker unit.<br><br>It is equipped with functions such as Bus Boost and S. S. B (Super Subsonic Base).<br><br>It comes with a remote control and can be operated such as power on/off, volume, turnover, phase, bus boost, and S. S. B.</p>
