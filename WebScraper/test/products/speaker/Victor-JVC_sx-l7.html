				<p class="detail">This is a speaker system that uses JVC&#39;s proprietary technology to support ultra-high-frequency playback of DVD audio and other audio.<br><br>In the SX-L7, the sound is created from the pure reproduction of upper and lower 2 octaves centered on the frequency of 440 Hz which is the sound of A used as the standard pitch of concert.<br>In addition, in order to meet the high specifications of digital sound sources such as DVD audio, we are also pursuing the quality of ultra-high sound range as well.<br><br>The unit layout has a structure called oblique omni array, and the voice coil is set in the direction in which the two woofer unit are closest to each other and the tweeter is placed between the woofer.<br>As a result, we have obtained natural characteristics like a good full-range speaker.<br><br>Two 18 cm oblicorn type woofers are installed in the lower range.<br>A balanced metal oblicorn is used for the diaphragm, and an of recap with a center cap with a shifted top is attached.<br>An aluminum die-cast frame is used for the frame, and a quick response Bakelite spider suspension is used for the damper. This unique structure realizes ideal medium and low frequency playback.<br><br>A 3 cm oblidome type tweeter is installed in the high range.<br>The diaphragm is made of hemp, which has the highest tensile strength among natural materials, and is rubberized using Victor&#39;s traditional method.<br>The magnetic circuit uses an alnico magnet with a bulb-shaped yoke, and the frame uses an aluminum die-cast frame.<br><br>It is equipped with a 1.9 cm hard dome type super tweeter for super high frequency band.<br>The diaphragm is made of aluminum dome and plated with pure gold. The magnetic circuit is made of rare-earth neodymium magnet to obtain strong magnetic flux density.<br>In addition, the unit is housed in a separate small cabinet with no dilution and ideal radiation characteristics, which improves the directivity in the ultrasonic band. This cabinet is made of solid Mizkie wood, which is high-density, has little change over time, and is acoustically superior, and is carved out with a potter&#39;s wheel.<br><br>Each part is carefully selected for the network part, and the crossover frequencies are set with an emphasis on the centrodesmus range of music that plays the upper and lower two octaves of the A sound in one unit.<br>The enclosure uses a bass reflex system.<br>30 mm thick MDF is used for the front baffle, 25 mm thick for the side plate, top plate and bottom plate, and 18 mm thick particleboards for the back plate.<br>In addition, the sound quality is improved by sticking a single maple board not only on the front side but also on the back side. Especially, the front baffle uses White Deer More, also called Great Maple.<br>The exterior is finished with a glossy coating on the surface.<br><br>The input terminal uses a gold-plated terminal that is compatible with Y lugs and banana plugs.<br>Bi-wiring connection and bi-amplifier drive are also supported.</p>
