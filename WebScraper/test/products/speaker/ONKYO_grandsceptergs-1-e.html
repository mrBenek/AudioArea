				<p class="detail">A speaker system designed based on a completely new theory of design and measurement aiming at the ultimate speaker.<br><br>The Grand-Ceptor is an all-horn configuration.<br>In principle, horn type speakers have good transient characteristics, but they also have disadvantages such as many time-domain distortions (multipath ghost distortion, reverb distortion, etc.). Theoretical analysis of on-kiyo has revealed that horn type speakers have very low high-order harmonic distortion compared with other systems in principle. Research and development has been carried out over a long period of time in order to realize an ideal speaker system by complete control of horn type speakers.<br>Although multi-pass ghost distortion and reverb distortion have been used to create sound because they are not necessarily objectionable, the Grandceptor eliminates these distortions for proper representation of the music.<br><br><strong>Configuration</strong><br>The GS-1 is a sound insulator and is divided into a low-sound reproduction block and a medium-sound reproduction block.<br>The bass block is divided into a low-frequency horn and a low-frequency compression driver unit with a back cavity, and the two low-frequency units are housed in separate back cavities of 40 liters each.<br>The middle and high sound block has a tilt adjustment circuit to adjust the sound axis.<br><br><strong>Woofer</strong><br>Two 28 cm cone type woofer W3060A are installed in the low range.<br>These units use a 10 cm diameter voice coil for a 23 mm effective diameter cone, and the magnetic circuit uses a 220 mm diameter magnet, the largest available at the time, to drive a 10 cm voice coil.<br>By combining a relatively small-diameter diaphragm with a large-diameter voice coil, the path of the sound wave inside the diaphragm is shortened and the transient is improved. In addition, it is strongly driven by a large magnet, and the movement of the cone is completely controlled by applying a horn load to the entire band of the woofer.<br><br>FRP laminated horn is used for the horn part.<br>The horn is sandwiched between FRP and anti-vibration materials. The back side of the phase plug is molded to match the shape of the driver&#39;s center cap and is covered with felt. The hyperbolic function is used for the change in the area of the horn, and the superelliptic function is used for the change in the shape. Both equations are solved by a computer, and the original model is obtained by using an NC lathe.<br><br><strong>Tweeter</strong><br>A horn type tweeter is installed in the middle and high area.<br>The diaphragm is a 65 mm diameter diaphragm made of titanium nitride that is integrally molded up to the voice coil bobbin, and the phase plug is ultra-precisely shaped by the lost wax method to obtain good high-frequency characteristics.<br>ダンプド FRP laminated horn is used for the horn. By stacking FRP and vibration isolation materials used for vibration isolation of iron bridges, multipath ghost distortion and reverb reverberation distortion are eliminated.<br><br><strong>Network</strong><br>The network circuit is a 2-way configuration and the network is a 12dB/oct. reverse connection configuration to eliminate the time delay caused by the circuit.<br>The network parts are installed in a distributed manner to reduce mutual interference.<br><br><strong>Enclosure</strong><br>The unit layout is based on the Constant Time Unit Array method to eliminate time lag due to the positional relationship between the woofer and the tweeter.<br><br>A unique layered structure is used to reduce the reverb distortion that occurs in the enclosure.<br>In general enclosures, reinforcement is used to suppress resonance. However, reinforcement only changes the frequency of resonance and does not absorb energy, so it can be adjusted but cannot be eliminated.<br>The Grand-Ceptor has a 7-layer structure consisting of six layers of Lauan and Yonematsu veneer, and is restrained by newly developed damping materials and steel plates to minimize vibration by orders of magnitude.<br><br>A glass plate is embedded in the top plate of the middle and high area regeneration block.<br><br><strong>Other</strong><br>By changing the connection of the terminal board on the back, you can use a special external equalizer or bi-amp drive without a divider.</p>
