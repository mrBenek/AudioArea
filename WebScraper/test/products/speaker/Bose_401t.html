				<p class="detail">A floor-type speaker system that uses cross-firing system and radial energy array technology.<br><br>We have adopted a cross-firing system.<br>People recognize the direction of the sound source by sensing the time difference between the sounds delivered to the right and left ears. Therefore, even if a stereo signal with a time component is reproduced from the left and right speakers, the sound image will be pulled toward either of the speakers if you listen closer to one of them.<br>This feature can be cancelled by increasing the level of sound coming from a distant speaker. In a cross-firing system, the woofer and tweeter are mounted at 45 degrees inside to compensate for the difference in sound level. Thus, the closer the listener is to one of the speakers, the more distant speakers are positioned in front of the listener, keeping the sound balance even.<br><br>Bose&#39;s unique radial energy array technology is used to achieve a sense of spaciousness, depth, and presence similar to a concert hall along with an excellent sense of orientation.<br>Radial Energy Array technology was developed through research and development of Bose. It is designed to satisfy the following conditions : &quot;The best balance is that indirect sound arrives 8-80 mS after direct sound, and it is very important that the level of reflected sound from the side is high, and that frequencies of 3 kHz or less are very important.&quot;<br>The design of the 401 is focused on the fact that if multiple units are installed close together, they can function as a transducer with a special radiation pattern depending on the frequency band. First of all, in the band of 1 kHz or less, two woofers work together and radiate energy as strongly as that of a large-diameter woofer. In the band of 1 kHz to 3 kHz, since the directivity of the units becomes strong, the woofers work separately. The outer woofer supplements the middle and high sound energy absorbed by the sidewall, and the inner woofer and the tweeter radiate energy strongly at 45 degrees inside. In the band of 3 kHz or more, the tweeter plays all of them. This realizes an ideal radiation pattern that reproduces the sound space of a concert hall, and realizes clear sound localization regardless of the position of the sound.<br><br>Two 16 cm cone type woofers are installed in the low range, and by dual driving, a comfortable input resistance is obtained.<br><br>A 5.1 cm cone type tweeter is installed in the high range.<br>This unit is filled with a magnetic fluid to achieve an excellent cooling effect, reducing distortion and achieving high durability.<br><br>A highly reliable heat-sensitive protection circuit is installed to protect the tweeter unit from excessive input.<br>This circuit senses the input to the tweeter and gently limits the signal current when the safety level is exceeded, ensuring unit protection without cutting the playback sound.<br><br>A unique dual-frequency network is used in the network section. Both the woofer and the tweeter are played over a band of approximately one octave, eliminating the response disturbance and phase shift in the crossover region.<br><br>There are 2 kinds of variations, 401B with black finish and 401T with cheek brown finish.</p>
