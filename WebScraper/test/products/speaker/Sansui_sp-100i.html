				<p class="detail">A bookshelf type speaker system that uses an inner frame mount system.<br><br>The SP-100i has 3 types of variations, SP-100iEX and SP-100iEX (W), which have different external finish from the SP-100i.<br>SP-100i has a titanium black finish, SP-100iEX has a walnut polyester mirror finish, and SP-100iEX (W) has a white three layer polyester mirror finish.<br><br>A unique inner frame mounting method is used for fixing the unit.<br>The SP-100i is equipped with a center baffle 40 mm thick in the center of the enclosure and secures the woofer frame and magnetic circuit to the center baffle. Unlike the conventional method in which the speaker unit is fixed to the front baffle with screws, the vibration contact point between the unit and the front baffle can be reduced to 0. In principle, the vibration of the front baffle is eliminated.<br>In addition, the tweeter is a top-mount type that is fixed to the top plate with an aluminum die-cast base, so interference between units is completely eliminated.<br>The unique inner frame has other advantages. The frame of a general unit has a strong design element and can be said to be the cause of unnecessary resonance. Therefore, the mounting part of the unit to the front baffle is eliminated, and the frame of the robust structure is adopted to support the magnetic circuit and diaphragm. This is the basic frame.<br><br>A 21 cm cone type woofer is installed in the low range.<br>The diaphragm is made of SSCF (Super Slender Carbon Fiber). The front skin of this diaphragm is made of ultra-fine 1000-filament carbon SSCF and special binder with moderate internal loss. The light and flexible diaphragm suppresses the sound inherent to carbon. In addition, the rigidity is increased by the 3-layer structure, making it close to the ideal shape of the diaphragm.<br>An inner edge is used for the edge part, and the edge is fixed from the back of the diaphragm, not from the surface. This minimizes the surface area of the edge, and reduces the edge squeal to achieve operation with good linearity from minute input to large input.<br>A large 120 φ strontium magnet is used for the magnetic circuit. The drive performance is as strong as that of a 30 cm class woofer, while at the same time achieving a low distortion factor. In addition, a twin magnet system with a 100 φ submagnet is used, and a magnetic shielding cover is provided to minimize leakage flux.<br><br>A 2.5 cm hard-domed tweeter is installed in the high range.<br>The diaphragm uses a twin diamond plating diaphragm. Titanium is used as the base material for this diaphragm, and diamond is ion-plated on the front and back of the diaphragm. This greatly increases the rise of the diaphragm and achieves transient high frequency characteristics at high speed.<br>The magnetic circuit is a twin magnet system using 80 φ and 75 φ strontium magnets, and is also equipped with a magnetic shielding cover.<br>A die-cast frame is used for the frame.<br><br>The network section is hollowed out from a 50 mm square piece of solid Yonematsu that is highly evaluated for its acoustic characteristics. The network elements are wrapped in sound absorbing material from different directions so that they do not interfere with each other. This isolates the network elements from the sound pressure inside the enclosure and the vibration of the enclosure, eliminating the influence of vibration.<br>In order to prevent interference between network elements, a two part structure is used.<br>The connection part uses a caulking method with less contact resistance, and the current density to each unit is made uniform to prevent loss of input signal.<br><br>The enclosure uses a bass reflex system.<br>Using a rear duct system with a bass reflex port on the back, the back pressure inside the enclosure is effectively utilized without making the sound from the speaker unit muddy.<br>In order to prevent cavity resonance generated from the fixing hole for mounting the support RUNNET, the fixing hole is removed from the front baffle and the support RUNNET is fixed to the side baffle.<br><br>Large OFC gold-plated speaker terminals are used for speaker terminals.<br>The speaker terminals are directly attached to the rear baffle to prevent cavity resonance.<br><br>There was a special speaker stand as an option sold separately.<br>The base plate is 50 mm thick, top plate plate is 30 mm thick, and the support is 25 mm thick. The MDF structure provides solid support for the speakers. The support can be filled with sound absorbing materials such as glass wool or felt, or with sand. The sound quality can be tuned according to the room.<br>This stand has 4 variations in the finish of the exterior.<br><br>There was a speaker base as an option sold separately.<br>It is a wooden speaker base embedded with a large pure copper insulator with excellent attenuation characteristics, and the influence of the place where the speaker is set can be minimized.<br>The wooden base is 40 mm thick, and the generation of standing wave is prevented by changing the width of front and back.<br>Depending on your preference, you can adjust the sound quality subtly by turning the copper insulator toward the speaker or the floor.</p>
