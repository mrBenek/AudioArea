				<p class="detail">This is a 4-way speaker system that pursues high quality musical and artistic quality by operating the best unit at the best piston motion band.<br><br>A 31 cm cone type woofer is installed in the low range.<br>The diaphragm is made of carbon graphite cone, which is suitable for digital sources. This diaphragm has a two layered structure in which two cones with different angles are stacked on the same axis to increase rigidity. In addition, a circular recess is provided at the base of the cone to cut high frequencies and suppress chamber squeals to increase strength.<br>The balance type magnetic circuit keeps up and down movements even, and the voice coil is edgewise wound with oxygen-free copper wire. Moreover, the long voice coil provides high tracking performance for large input.<br>A magnet with a diameter of 160 mm is used. By attaching a copper cap to the pole, the distortion due to the back electromotive force is suppressed. The increase in impedance is suppressed.<br><br>It is equipped with a 10 cm hard dome type squaker in the middle and low range.<br>The diaphragm is made of newly developed materials. Like the woofer, it uses a balanced magnetic circuit and a Cu cap to achieve a high efficiency of 97 dB. The voice coil is made of a light and high-conductivity Cu クラットアルミ wire edgewise winding. This realizes a wide range of 150 Hz to 10 kHz as a stand-alone characteristic despite being a scorker.<br>The equalizer is made of polycarbonate, making it hard to resonate, the frame is made of 52S material that can also be used as a diaphragm, and the low frequency characteristics are improved by providing a back cavity.<br><br>It is equipped with 6 cm hard dome type high speed coker for middle and high area.<br>By using the same diaphragm material as the Skoker and also by using the same structure, the sound connection is improved. This unit can reproduce at 500 Hz to 20 kHz by itself, but by using only 4 kHz to 8 kHz, high-quality reproduction in the piston motion band is possible.<br><br>A 2.2 cm hard dome type tweeter is installed in the high range.<br>The diaphragm is made of the same material as Skoka and HSS Coker. By making it lighter and more rigid, it can be flattened to the regeneration limit of the unit.<br>This unit can play from 5 kHz to 40 kHz, and the crossover is set to 8 kHz or higher.<br><br>The network section employs a distributed design in which the circuit boards for the woofer and the mid - and high-frequency range are completely independent.<br>For the woofer coil, a silicon steel core with excellent low-frequency characteristics is used, and 1.4 mm oxygen-free copper wire is wound to improve the performance. For the mid-range coil, a fairlight core with excellent high-frequency characteristics is used, and oxygen-free copper wire is wound.<br>We have adopted a newly developed special electrolytic capacitor for the woofer, a black-gate capacitor for the low-pass cut for the squaker, a WT capacitor for the high-speed squaker, and an MF capacitor for the tweeter. These capacitors take advantage of the characteristics of each capacitor.<br>In addition, strain is reduced by crimping wiring, and 0.18 mm φ 56 core oxygen-free copper wire is used for internal wiring.<br><br>The front and rear baffles of the enclosure are made of top-of-the-line high density particle board. Two 15-mm-thick re-plywood boards are used to increase the strength. Round baffles are used on both sides to reduce diffraction.<br>The side plate is 25 mm thick. In addition, 20 mm thick plates are passed around the side, top plate and bottom plate as reinforcement, and the thickness of the side plate is 45 mm. In addition, two horizontal reinforcing bars are used for the front baffle, and a Woofer hollowed out plate is used for the rear baffle for reinforcement, and reinforcement plates are passed around the front, back, left and right sides to increase rigidity.</p>
