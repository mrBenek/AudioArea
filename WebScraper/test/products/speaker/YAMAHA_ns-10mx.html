				<p class="detail">This is an anti-magnetic speaker system that inherits the sound of the NS-10M small studio monitor and uses Yamaha&#39;s newly developed anti-magnetic system (A ・ Mag).<br><br>The NS-10MX and NS-10MPRO have the same design except for the magnetic shielding circuit, internal wiring materials and around the tweeter, and the large speaker terminal and network are the same design.<br>In addition, the NS-10MX is designed to improve the resolution of the low band and the S/N ratio of the high band.<br><br>The magnetic circuit uses an A / MAG type anti-magnetic circuit originally developed by Yamaha.<br>In this method, the balance point of the magnetic flux distribution in the magnetic circuit is found by repeating computer simulation, and the canceling magnet is magnetized under the optimized magnetized magnetic flux distribution, and combined and bonded with the main magnet. As a result, the magnetic shielding type magnetic circuit of the conventional ferrite magnet improves the S/N feeling and the sound loss.<br>In addition, covering noise is suppressed by attaching felt to the magnet cover.<br><br>A 18 cm cone woofer is installed in the low range.<br>The corn paper is made into a sheet form by a special manufacturing method using coniferous wood materials and Japanese paper manufacture technology. Compared with the freshly made corn paper, the density and thickness of the corn paper are less uneven. This material is molded into a conical type straight cone for use.<br>In addition, by adopting a voice coil wound with heat-resistant copper ribbon wire edgewise and a lightweight voice coil bobbin, high efficiency and high input resistance are achieved. Moreover, by adopting a high-compliance roll edge which is flexible and does not change with age, higher quality is achieved.<br><br>A 3.5 cm soft dome type tweeter is installed in the high range.<br>The precisely woven diaphragm material is uniformly coated with two types of viscoelastic resin and thermosetting resin. It is integrally molded in a dome shape with tangential edges with excellent center holding capacity. It also has excellent transient characteristics due to its weight reduction of 0.6g including edges.<br>In addition, by adopting a new tuning acoustic absorber, a well balance between low and high frequencies is realized, and it is considered to be easy to listen even on a short range monitor.<br><br>A hexagonal nut is used to fix the unit.<br><br>Equipped with a large screw-type speaker terminal that supports very thick speaker cords.<br><br>The enclosure uses a particle board manufactured by American Weyerhaeuser. The baffle plate is 15 mm thick, and the top plate, side plate, and bottom plate are 12 mm thick. It is assembled into a 6-sided structure. In addition, the sound quality is enhanced by using a bonding method and special adhesive determined through repeated trial listening.<br>The exterior is made of real wood of birch, and has a black semi-gloss finish by 7 process painting same as NS-100M.</p>
