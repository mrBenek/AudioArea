				<p class="detail">An improved speaker system for the DS 500.<br>Returning to the origin of sound, the vocals which come out from one part of human mouth are not reproduced by many units, but are realized by focusing on the form of 2 way.<br><br>A 18 cm cone woofer is used for the low range.<br>In order to prevent mid-gap, which had been a problem in the two way system, the weight of the pure cross carbon vibration plate is reduced. The vibration plate is reduced by 15%, the edge is reduced by 15%, and the voice coil is reduced by 22%. The vibration system has excellent transient characteristics.<br>In addition, we have newly developed a 2-layer structure that is flexible and elastic with a large internal loss at the edge, and we thoroughly pay attention to the parts that greatly affect sound quality.<br><br>A 2.5 cm titanium oval dome type tweeter is used for the high range.<br>An oval diaphragm is a dome diaphragm with a special shape that is circular at the outer periphery and becomes elliptical as it approaches the center. This oval shape is an extension of the resonance cancellation structure using the conventional laser cut and staggered rib method. It eliminates the high-frequency resonance peculiar to metal plates by changing the shape from circular to elliptical.<br>In addition, attaching cork material to the frame reduces the secondary reflection from the front of the frame.<br><br>The network section uses an isolated wiring network with a separate layout to prevent interference and influence from electrical, magnetic, and acoustic aspects.<br>In addition, we focus on selecting parts to supply each unit without damaging the input signal, such as using a large polyester film condenser.<br><br>The enclosure uses a newly developed bus transmission system.<br>In place of the conventional paper-tube type bass reflex duct, a folding type wooden bass reflex duct has been adopted. As a result, it can be demonstrated over a wider range of frequencies, and the low sound energy feeling and transient characteristics are improved.<br>In addition, since the bass reflex duct is fixed to the enclosure, the whole is strengthened and unnecessary vibration is reduced.<br>In addition, by can be laid out without being aware of the back by making it a high-grade plated finish including the back.<br><br>In order to support AV, it is designed to prevent magnetic field.</p>
