				<p class="detail">This 3-way speaker system uses a honeycomb planar vibrating plate.<br><br>The honeycomb structure is made by sandwiching a honeycomb-shaped core (honeycomb) developed which was developed as a structure for jet planes and space ships, with aluminum skin material. It is lightweight and highly rigid.<br>In order to take advantage of the honeycomb structure, the SB-10 employs a flat diaphragm, which eliminates the disturbance in frequency characteristics caused by air resonance that occurs in the cone type.<br><br>A flat woofer with a 32 cm honeycomb flat diaphragm is mounted in the low range.<br>By directly nodal driving the honeycomb flat diaphragm with a 160 mm large diameter voice coil, the piston motion range is expanded to the high frequency range of 3.3 khz. This greatly reduces the distortion of the vibration system and realizes smooth frequency characteristics up to the high frequency range.<br>For the edge, urethane foam edge with excellent linearity at large amplitude is adopted, and it has a down roll shape to avoid adverse effects due to diffraction. In addition, voice coil has high heat resistance specification, and together with polyamide laminated film bobbin which is resistant to deformation at high temperature, it has high input resistance design which can withstand high temperature of 200 ℃.<br>The magnetic circuit is an inner magnet type structure of large ferrite magnet, and the center pole is equipped with a pure aluminum cap to reduce the current distortion in the middle and high frequency range.<br><br>The mid-range is equipped with a planar mid-range using an 8 cm honeycomb disk diaphragm.<br>This unit achieves flat and smooth frequency characteristics over a wide range from 200 Hz to 7.5 kHz by directly driving the low-order vibration mode node with a 50.5 φ voice coil. The edge section is down-rolled to prevent deterioration of characteristics due to sound pressure radiation from the edge in the high frequency range. The edge section is covered with an edge cover.<br>The voice coil is wrapped around an aluminum bobbin with excellent radiation heat and is highly heat-resistant, and the magnetic circuit is covered with a pure aluminum cap on the center pole to suppress current distortion.<br>Aluminum die-cast is used for the frame to eliminate adverse effects caused by frame resonance.<br><br>The high-frequency range is equipped with a full-drive leaf tweeter that inherits the performance of the 10TH1000 and 10TH800.<br>The leaf tweeter has a structure in which an ultra-lightweight diaphragm, which is approximately one twentieth of the vibration system of a conventional metallic dome tweeter, is fully driven by a magnetic circuit with a structure in which two Oka magnets are sandwiched between I-type and L-type yokes. With this structure, in addition to the excellent ultra-wide range regeneration capability of 125 kHz, high input resistance that can withstand 20W continuous sinusoidal input is realized. In addition, with 8 Ω constant impedance design that does not require a matching transformer from DC to 125 kHz, it can accurately respond to sharp rise signals.<br>In order to prevent disturbance of the directional characteristics in the high frequency range, a high-precision die-cast equalizer fin is installed between the sound pressure radiation surface to obtain good directional characteristics.<br><br>The enclosure is fully enclosed with 25 mm thick high-density particle board.<br>The interior is sufficiently reinforced by vibration analysis using the finite element method, and air leak is suppressed by highly accurate wooden framing of Z-frame three way stop system.<br>The exterior has a real rosewood open boa finish.</p>
