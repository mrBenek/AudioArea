				<p class="detail">This speaker system inherits the development concept and design of the IRS and is 1.5m tall and can be installed in ordinary homes.<br><br>RS-1 is designed by the diffraction wing and point source theory.<br>Point source theory is an acoustic theory that radiates all frequencies in all directions from an infinitesimal vibrating sphere. However, this theory was treated somewhat vaguely because it was impossible in reality. RS-1 is designed to produce an effect equivalent to that of point source transmission at the listening position, making it closer to point source theory.<br>As with the IRS, we use gently curved diffraction wings to reduce the dispersion caused by the interference between direct and reflected waves. In order to improve the directivity over the entire band, we use bidirectivity, which emits sound waves on the rear surface, especially in the middle and high regions, to realize an ideal spherical wave. Furthermore, as the frequency increases, we reduce the area of the diaphragm and arrange the unit so that the focus of the sound image is narrowed down to the super tweeter to clarify the total focus.<br>As a result, although it is multi-way and multi-drive, the energy response is almost equivalent to that of a point source. Pin-point sound localization and 3-dimensional sound field reproducibility are obtained.<br><br>The woofer column has a structure with R at the corner.<br>The unit has six 20 cm polypropylene cone type woofers arranged in tandem for the low frequency band, and the newly developed servo sensing network enables flat playback down to the ultra low frequency band.<br>The polypropylene used for the diaphragm has an extremely low Q value of 7 to 9 compared to 90 to 100 for paper cone, and exhibits excellent linearity. In addition, since the Young&#39;s elastic modulus is also high, the cone distortion caused by transient large input is almost eliminated, and a clear playback sound is achieved. In addition, polypropylene cone forms an effective sonic barrier against back waves in the enclosure, has strong tearing force, can withstand high temperatures of 135 ℃, and is not affected by humidity. It has many advantages.<br><br>Thick solid oak is used for the diffraction wing part.<br>The unit is equipped with seven bi-directional EMIMs, three EMITs in the front and one in the rear.<br>Six of the seven EMIMs are responsible for the frequencies from 140 Hz to 700 Hz. Only the third one from the top receives frequencies from 700 Hz to 3 kHz. Among the three EMITs in the front and back, two EMITs at the top and bottom receive frequencies from 3 to 8 kHz. The frequency band of 8 kHz or diaphragm is 1/2 inch wide and 1 inch long, receives frequencies above 8 kHz. This EMIT is located adjacent to the third EMIM from the top.<br>As a result, the total energy response is extremely clear at low levels and uniform over all bands.<br><br>The EMIM (Electromagnetic Induction Midrange) mounted in the mid-range has a structure in which an ultra-thin and ultra-lightweight plastic diaphragm made by etching an ultra-thin voice coil is sandwiched between samarium-cobalt, a strong magnetic material, and the diaphragm is driven entirely by a strong magnetic field.<br>As a result, it can respond to transient signals and large instantaneous inputs that the cone, dome, and horn types cannot follow due to their structure. Moreover, it is more resistant to large continuous inputs than the condenser type, and realizes excellent mid-range reproduction. In addition, the reproduction band is wide, and a flat response from 150 Hz to 5 kHz is obtained.<br>In addition, it is bi-directional with slit-shaped gratings on the back plate, which realizes excellent sound field reproducibility.<br><br>The EMIT (Electromagnetic Induction Tweeter) mounted on the high-frequency range is a full-surface drive type tweeter in which an ultra-thin and ultra-light plastic diaphragm diaphragm is sandwiched between strong samarium-cobalt magnets like the EMIM.<br>Flat reproduction is possible up to 32 kHz ultra-high frequencies. Moreover, since the main radiation source is 1 1/2 inch wide, excellent horizontal directional characteristics of -2dB (20 kHz) are exhibited even in the 60 ° direction.<br><br>Comes with a dedicated crossover unit.<br><br>* In RS-1, there was a recommended specification for power amplifier for woofer.<br>The condition is a power amplifier with an output of 150W/ch or more, a substantial power source, and a housing installation with a thick cable on the - side. It was written that the use of bridge wiring amplifier or vacuum tube type amplifier should be avoided as much as possible.</p>
