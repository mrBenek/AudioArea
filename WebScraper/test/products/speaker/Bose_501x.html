				<p class="detail">A 2.1 channel speaker system designed to fit into your lifestyle and allow you to immerse yourself in sound wherever you like.<br><br>The 2-way speaker system, which used to be packaged in a single enclosure, has been divided into a cube speaker as the main system of the 501X and a shadow base box as a backup system for frequencies below 150 Hz. The cube speaker incorporates bifacial concept that allows free control of indirect and direct sound, while the shadow base box uses Bose&#39;s patented tandem tune method.<br>This 2.1 channel configuration makes it possible to play the deep bass while keeping the high-capacity enclosure compact. In addition, the shadow bass box is designed using psychoacoustics so that there is no sense of the direction of the sound source and the sound can be reproduced as the same as the cube speaker regardless of the location.<br><br>A bifacial switch is installed to control the ratio of direct sound and indirect sound energy. This is achieved by switching the switch and moving the two directions of the top and bottom of the cube speaker.<br>Bifacial switches use Bose&#39;s unique indirect sound theory to control high-frequency energy and phase characteristics.<br><br><strong>Cube speaker</strong><br><br>The cube speaker is equipped with a 5.7 cm cone unit.<br>This unit uses newly developed special technologies for voice coils, cone paper, dampers, etc. to achieve playback in the frequency range from 150 Hz to higher frequencies and high input resistance. In addition, it uses a precision design of micron order by computer control.<br>In addition, anti-magnetic measures are taken by covering the magnetic circuit with high-efficiency shield material.<br><br>The cube speaker uses an acoustic network based on Bose&#39;s patent.<br>The network achieves an acoustic attenuation of 18dB/oct. by minimizing the use of conventional coils and condensers that distort sound, and by controlling the airtightness of the enclosure, the mass of the driver unit, and compliance.<br><br><strong>Shadow base box</strong><br><br>The shadow bass box uses Bose&#39;s unique tandem tune system for bass reproduction.<br>In this method, two ports with different resonance points are placed on the front and rear surfaces of the woofer to increase low-frequency energy and achieve low-distortion heavy low-frequency playback.<br>In addition, we have introduced a method that mechanically limits the frequency characteristics of the woofer to a certain band based on our original theory using psychoacoustics. By playing back frequencies below 150 Hz where the human ear cannot detect the direction of sound, the connection with the cube speaker is smooth.<br><br>Unit is equipped with 2 16.5 cm cone type woofers.<br><br><strong>Other</strong><br><br>A computer developed by Bose for speaker production is installed in the manufacturing process, and the design and production process are managed, making it possible to use only a small amount of adhesive for voice coils, etc., and to uniform the special quality.<br>We have also introduced it into the design of the enclosure to improve the accuracy of the system and eliminate the coloring caused by variation.</p>

		<h5>How to install the speaker</h5>

        <ul class="namearea">
			<li><strong>To center the sound image</strong><br>When playing a small musical composition, you can orient the sound image to the center by turning the upper speaker inward and obliquely backward.<br><img src="501x(3).jpg"></li>
			<li><strong>For orientation and scale monitoring</strong><br>A clear sound image localization can be obtained.<br>Ideal for use as a monitor in a studio or in a relatively large space.<br>Turn the upper and lower speakers toward the front.<br><img src="501x(6).jpg"></li>
			<li><strong>To expand the sound image naturally to the left and right</strong><br>When playing a full orchestra or choir, you can expand the sound with a sense of scale by turning the upper speaker toward the back of the lip.<br><img src="501x(4).jpg"></li>
			<li><strong>Expanding the sound field while moving the sound image to the center</strong><br>This is the most suitable setting for AV systems. It is ideal for audio from the screen, music to fill a room, or singing with an orchestra in the background.<br>You can enjoy it by turning the bottom speaker inward and the top speaker outward and backward.<br><img src="501x(5).jpg"></li>
			<li><strong>Spector ルサウンド system</strong><br>By setting the cube speaker up and down separately, you can get scale and powerful sound.<br>You can enjoy the spread of a full case tiger by arranging it in a row.<br><img src="501x(7).jpg"><br><br>Set the upper and lower speakers apart by about 1m and extend them to the left and right.<br>(It is also OK to move the upper speaker further to the back by 50 cm.)<br>With this method, the sense of scale is improved by separating the four speakers vertically, and the sense of spaciousness is created by separating the four speakers horizontally.<br>In addition, by shifting 2 (inner speakers) to the back, the depth appears, and you can get the impact equivalent to a large floor system.<br><img src="501x(8).jpg"><br>* When using the cube speaker by separating the top and bottom, use the supplied connection code (standard jacks - standard jacks).</li>
			<li><img src="501x(2).jpg"><br>The shadow base box can be installed freely because you cannot feel the sound source direction.</li>
