				<p class="detail">A bookshelf type speaker system developed as a superior model of the D 302 e.<br><br>A 16 cm cone type woofer is installed in the low range.<br>The diaphragm uses A-ONF Monocoque, a diaphragm developed in-house. This is a 3-layer structure made of natural fiber and aramid fiber made of PEN with high rigidity and extremely low natural sound. The rigidity is dramatically improved by integrating the center cap.<br>To drive this excellent diaphragm, it is equipped with a voice coil with a diameter of 65 mm, which is normally used in 30 cm class large diameter units, and a large ferrite magnet with a weight of 1090g / diameter of 140 mm.<br>In addition, a vibration isolation structure using an aluminum die-cast frame with an average thickness of approximately 6 mm, and a shape that reduces unwanted reflected sound on an artificial leather edge made of ultra-fine fibers are employed to thoroughly eliminate noise down to the minute level.<br><br>A 4-cm ring-type tweeter is installed in the high range.<br>The diaphragm is a ring type with an outer diameter of 40 mm and an inner diameter of 30 mm. It is driven by a voice coil with a diameter of 35 mm arranged on the same axis. By making the span from the driving point to the end of the diaphragm the shortest, the split vibration of the diaphragm can be suppressed, so that clear high-frequency reproduction in which the piston motion region reaches almost 20 khz is realized.<br>In addition, an equalizer made of newly designed machined aluminum is mounted on the inside of the diaphragm, and by its unique shape, it acquires flatter frequency characteristics up to the ultra-high frequency of 100 kHz.<br>In addition, thorough noise reduction measures have been taken, such as anti-reflection measures around the diaphragm and the adoption of a back chamber shape that does not generate flutter echo.<br><br>The network circuit uses an isolated wiring method that separates the woofer and tweeter circuits to prevent the signals in the woofer and tweeter regions from interfering with each other.<br>The capacitors are manufactured by WIMA of Germany, which is highly reliable in terms of sound quality. Moreover, by introducing circuit and mounting technology that does not generate potential differences in the ground lines of each network, we prevent masking of minute audio signals.<br><br>The enclosure uses a bass reflex system.<br>A slit duct has been adopted for the bass reflex duct. By adopting a long and narrow rectangular cross section, unnecessary high-order noise components can be attenuated. It is also advantageous in terms of viscous resistance of the air. Therefore, low sound reproduction with a sense of speed can be realized. In addition, the cabinet and duct sections are separated to reduce the influence of mutual vibration.<br>The baffle surface is 30 mm thick and the side is 18 mm thick. It not only supports each unit, but also controls the cabinet resonance in a balanced manner. The baffle surface is rounded at the corners to prevent unwanted sound from being diffracted.<br>The exterior is finished with a matte black finish on the baffle and top and a real wood veneer finish on the side.<br><br>The speaker terminal uses a bi-wired terminal made of brass and plated with gold.<br><br>Includes a short bar for bi-wiring.<br><br>There was a speaker stand corresponding to D-312E as an option sold separately.<br>This stand can be installed without a D-312E base and comes with a D-302E base and removable cleats.</p>
