				<p class="detail">This speaker system was developed based on technologies cultivated through the development of professional studio monitors and EXCLUSIVE S5, and by making full use of original technologies and wavefront control technology.<br><br>It uses a vertical twin in which two woofers are arranged above and below with a tweeter at the center.<br>As a result, the entire range of sound from low to high range is radiated around the tweeter, resulting in rich sound field feeling and clear sound image localization.<br>We are developing and introducing new wave front control technology by further developing this technology.<br>This is a scientific analysis of how sound waves from speakers spread and reach the listener&#39;s ear. It has been improved with the points of &quot;controlling the energy time of the woofer and the tweeter on the time axis,&quot; &quot;controlling the directivity of the woofer and the tweeter,&quot; &quot;controlling the electrical phase such as the network,&quot; and &quot;controlling the wavefront diffraction by the baffle shape.&quot;<br><br>A 20 cm cone type woofer is used for the low range.<br>The magnetic circuit uses an Alnico magnet that is approximately 12% higher than the S-99twin.<br>The diaphragm is made of the pulp cone used in the TAD unit laminated with polymer film, and the center cap is coated with CRA (Cap Resonance Absorber) as in S5.<br>The frame is made of zinc die-cast and has 2.6 times the specific gravity of aluminum, giving it high rigidity.<br><br>A 3 cm dome type tweeter and a W. F. (wave front) director made of Painted maple laminate machined out of the same material as EXCLUSIVE S5 are used for the high range.<br>The wave front at the listening position of the listener is matched by controlling the time axis to adjust the positional relation with the woofer and controlling the directivity by the horn shape.<br>A ceramic graphite diaphragm with a carbon purity of 99.9% is used for the diaphragm, and an alnico magnet is used for the magnetic circuit.<br><br>Each unit uses a midship mounting method, and each unit is fixed inside the enclosure to prevent vibration of the unit from being transmitted to the baffle.<br>In addition, we are thoroughly pursuing vibration-free and resonance-free systems throughout the entire system, such as a floating top that reduces unnecessary vibration of the top plate and a shield frame that reduces unnecessary vibration transmitted to the frame.<br><br>In the network, the woofer circuit and the tweeter circuit are independent. Especially, the tweeter is directly connected by crimping wiring.<br>The mounting of each element is also vibration-proof and arranged so as not to be affected by crosstalk.<br><br>The enclosure is made of walnut real wood with oil stainless steel finish.<br>In addition, the secondary RUNNET has a baffle surface and a flat surface, and the sound is tuned with the secondary RUNNET attached, so you can enjoy it with the net attached.<br>In addition, a rear duct is used to avoid unnecessary radiation noise (mid-range component) from the duct.<br>In addition, sound-absorbing felt is attached to the openings to prevent interference.<br><br>A bi-wired connection terminal is used for the input terminal.<br><br>Cleats and felts are included to support floors such as flooring and carpet.<br><br>The name plate is made of maple.</p>
