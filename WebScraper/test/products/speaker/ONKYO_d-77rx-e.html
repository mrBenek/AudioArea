				<p class="detail">This speaker system was created based on the development concept of &quot;powerful and emotional vocals&quot; which wants to reproduce at the same time the strong sense of scale inherent in 3 ways and the depth of musical expression that gently speaks.<br><br>In order to prevent phase rotation due to crossover in the important band of music, both Woofer and Skorker are covered up to the cutoff frequency of 2300 Hz, eliminating the fundamental sound of vocals and formant frequency crossover.<br><br>A 30 cm bio black cone unit is used for the low range.<br>In addition, it uses a direct wiring method that sends music signals directly to the unit.<br><br>To cover 4 octaves from 120 Hz to 2000 Hz in the middle range, it is equipped with a proven 16 cm aperture unit.<br>In order to match the low-frequency range, a lightweight Bio-Croscone diaphragm is used. This diaphragm satisfies the requirements of light weight, high rigidity, high internal loss, and high airtightness by producing and mixing ascidian cellulose, which has the highest crystallinity among natural cellulose, with wood pulp produced in the high latitude region near the Arctic.<br>The adoption of the short voice coil, which further advanced the concept of MDCT, was designed by increasing the size of the magnetic circuit so that the voice coil can always be oscillated in a uniform magnetic flux density. Compared to the general long voice coil, the voice coil has less distortion, and the differential operates under a constant electromagnetic brake, thus realizing sound with less distortion and high resolution.<br><br>A 2.5 cm dome type unit is adopted for the high-frequency band.<br>The diaphragm is made of an aluminum-magnesium alloy in which the diaphragm and voice coil bobbin are integrated, and has succeeded in reducing the weight by approximately 25% compared with the conventional tweeter.<br>In addition, by using copper short ring, which is also an MDCT technology, the impedance rise at high frequencies, which is harmful to sound quality caused by AC magnetic flux, is suppressed. It is compatible with high-sampling digital sources, and reproduction is possible up to 40 kHz.<br><br>For the network, we have succeeded in simple circuit configuration such as direct wiring of woofer to eliminate mounting reciprocal induction by dividing parts by band of each unit, and to avoid phase distortion caused by using complicated network circuit.<br><br>A high-density particle board is used for the enclosure, and the structural strength is increased by soundbars and reinforcement materials to suppress unnecessary vibration.<br>In addition, the front baffle is made of high-altitude, high-quality softwood medium density fiberboard.<br>In addition, consideration is given to minimizing the use of sound absorbing material so as not to affect the necessary frequency range which influences the tone color.<br><br>The terminal section has a banana plug compatible gold-plated brass scraping terminal.<br>It is installed directly on the back plate, looking for a place with high strength and less susceptible to vibration.<br><br>A special speaker stand is sold separately.<br>This stand uses hard-textured, crisp softwood MDF to enhance overall sound quality.<br>In addition, it has a structure that eliminates standing waves generated by vibrations at the bottom of the speaker.</p>
