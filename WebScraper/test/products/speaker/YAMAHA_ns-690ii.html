				<p class="detail">This is a speaker system that further improves the sound of the NS 690 and enhances its perfection.<br><br>The low range is equipped with JA 3060 which is a 30 cm cone type woofer.<br>This unit is the woofer diameter of the NS-1000M and has the same structure and almost the same material, but the edge has been changed from cloth to urethane foam to match the sound of the NS-690II, and it has been refined at the same time.<br>The cone paper is made of cone paper utilizing the know-how of material research for many years. It has improved start-up characteristics compared to the conventional one. In addition, the shape is finished into a conical type with corrugation, and division vibration is suppressed. By using urethane foam edge for the edge, fluctuation of fo due to temperature change is suppressed. In addition, linearity is improved by using newly examined material and impregnation material for the damper.<br>A large ferrite magnet of 156 φ is used for the magnetic circuit. The voice coil is made by edgewise winding of copper ribbon wire on DuPont nylon fiber Nomex bobbin. In addition, by adopting a copper center cap, disturbance of impedance characteristics is suppressed and third harmonic distortion caused by magnetic distortion is suppressed.<br><br>The middle area is equipped with JA 0701 b which is a 7.5 cm soft dome type squaker.<br>The diaphragm uses a double-coated diaphragm with a new mixed coating agent, and realizes high linearity by combining it with an integrally molded tangential edge.<br>We have newly developed and used a special voice coil that is lightweight and has high electrical conductivity. Yamaha&#39;s original FRP sheet made of glass-based fiber is used for the bobbin. Air holes are provided in several places in the bobbin to equalize air pressure inside and outside the bobbin. Smooth and linear dynamic characteristics are achieved. In particular, high-order harmonic distortion due to irregular motion such as bobbin deflection is reduced.<br>The magnetic circuit uses a ferrite magnet of 120 φ -60 φ -22t. The effective air-gap magnetic flux density is 14,500 gauss. The glass wool filled inside the unit and the air damping by the back cavity are combined. The Q of the vibration system of JA-0701B is 0.5 and fo is 280 Hz, which is low.<br><br>A 3 cm soft dome tweeter, JA 0509 b, is installed in the high range.<br>The diaphragm uses a double-coated diaphragm with a new mixed coating agent similar to the Skoker. The edge uses an integrally molded tangential edge. The difference from the Skoker is the thickness. It is thin because the weight balance with the voice coil is taken into consideration for the small diameter and because it is lighter to extend the high-frequency characteristics.<br>The voice coil uses a lightweight aluminum ribbon wire wound edgewise, and the magnetic circuit uses a 80 φ -40 φ -20t ferrite magnet with an effective air gap flux density of 15,500 gauss.<br>In JA-0509B, an air hole is provided in the outer pole on the back of the edge to release the air in the edge part to make the movement of the edge smooth.<br><br>Aluminum die-cast is used for the frame of each unit.<br><br>The network is determined through repeated characteristic checks and trial listening.<br>The coil is a bobbin with ferrite core and wound with 1 φ formal wire with low DC resistance. Power loss is prevented by limiting the resistance value of the coil to 1/20 or less of the voice coil impedance. The coils are installed at right angles to each other to eliminate mutual inductance and reduce characteristic degradation due to induction.<br>MP capacitor with good characteristics is used.<br><br>It is equipped with level control for middle and high range.<br><br>The enclosure is hermetically sealed.<br>For the NS-690II, we have changed from RC plywood for the NS-690 to the same particleboard for the back plate. This particleboard is made from coniferous trees selected from all over the world. Its density is 10% higher than that of the previous model. Similarly to the NS-1000M, the Woofer cut out part of the baffle plate is bonded to the back plate as a reinforcement, thereby increasing the weight of the enclosure by nearly 40%. In addition, the sealing method of the back plate has been changed from screw fastening to adhesive to improve the sealing degree. The thickness of the front and back plate is 25 mm thick, and the side plate and top plate are 20 mm thick.<br><br>The exterior has an open pore finish of Castor (plug).</p>
