				<p class="detail">A bookshelf type speaker system equipped with a MID4 concept bio-cross cone unit and SH horn.<br>The MID4 concept is an idea that focuses on vocal expression, and by covering four octaves from 120 Hz to 2000 Hz with one unit, music can be played without failure.<br><br>A 27 cm cone type woofer is used for the low range.<br>High internal loss type pure cross carbon is used for the diaphragm, and the unique resonance dispersion structure realizes deep low sound reproduction.<br>In addition, both the diaphragm and edge have been reduced by 15%.<br><br>16 cm cone type skoker is used for the middle area.<br>In order to cover four octaves from 120 Hz to 2000 Hz, which is the main band of vocals, with one unit, the diaphragm has a balanced 16 cm diameter. In addition, we have developed and adopted an ultra-lightweight (2.6g) adopted an ultra-lightweight (g) been developed and is used for the diaphragm.<br>Biochloroscone is a mixture of wood pulp produced in high latitudes near the Arctic and refined cellulose, which is highly crystalline among natural cellulose. As a result of the formation of the paper layer network by integrating these two types of cellulose, the confidentiality is improved.<br><br>For the high-frequency band, we have adopted the SH horn (SH horn), which was developed when the Grand Scepter GS-1 was designed, as a prototype model, and the SH horn tweeter, which was developed by taking advantage of the know-how of the SH horn.<br>The change of Horn cross-section is determined by hyperbolic function, and the change of shape is determined by superelliptic function including oblate function and shape function by solving simultaneous equations.<br>In addition, we have taken thorough measures to eliminate multipath ghost distortion, which is a problem in horn sound quality, in terms of horn shape and structure.<br>In addition, the gap adjustment between the diaphragm and phase plug, which is an important factor determining the sound quality of the horn type, is designed to make the gap as narrow as possible. We have developed our own new technology to achieve more stable performance, and have achieved mass production of high-precision horns.<br>This new technology improves the accuracy of the height and shape of the diaphragm by the ultra-precision press method and streamlines the manufacturing process by using the slide-type pole piece. This makes it possible to control the total number with high accuracy and narrow gap.<br><br>Each unit is provided with anti-magnetic measures using a cancel magnet to suppress leakage flux.<br>This prevents the influence of magnetic fields on the choke coils in the network and protects cathode ray tubes and other objects.<br><br>In the network section, the circuit board for each unit is divided, and all parts that need to be divided up into circuits and parts are divided to create a high-purity network with no interference and little distortion.<br><br>The enclosure uses an acoustic wave regulator consisting of a slit and a chamber to suppress standing waves. This reduces the frequency band that is necessary when sound absorbing materials are used frequently. This reduces the low-frequency response and noise that is difficult to pass through.<br>In addition, in order to prevent the reflection and diffraction at the edge angle and the unevenness of the front baffle, the baffle surface is flattened except for the projection such as emblem and controller, and a large round of 40 mm is provided on both sides.<br><br>In order to improve the overall sound quality when installed in a listening room, the speaker stand is designed with high rigidity and no resonance.<br>It is made of a hard board that secures the same strength as D-77FX, and uses a single-leg structure that does not generate standing waves.<br>In addition, you can fine-tune the height of the rear two of the four bottom points for flat and non-rattling settings even on slightly uneven floors.</p>
