				<p class="detail">This is a bookshelf type speaker system that is slightly smaller than the LS 5000 using a passive radiator system.<br><br>The enclosure uses a passive radiator method, which uses the internal sound pressure changes caused by the woofer to drive the passive radiator, greatly improving the efficiency of the low frequency range.<br>In the LS 3000, the passive radiator is equipped with a 20 cm cone type passive radiator. In order to synchronize sound quality and vibration with the woofer, this unit uses the same cone paper and edge as the woofer to improve the low-frequency texture. In addition, the 13g weight at the base of the cone paper realizes a low-frequency range with a high sound pressure level.<br><br>A 20 cm cone type woofer is installed in the low range.<br>This unit uses CF cone with bright sound developed in LS series, and NUKP (unbleached pulp) is blended to improve the sharpness of sound.<br>In addition, a double chamber system has been adopted. The chamber is bonded to the voice coil of the woofer and the chamber is attached to the cone paper. The small paper chamber directly connected to the voice coil extends the high range of the woofer sufficiently. In addition, the cloth chamber on the cone paper smoothly reduces the sound pressure that has extended to the high range and is connected to the tweeter.<br>An asymmetrical S-shaped edge is used for the edge part to allow the cone paper to move freely by allowing a large up and down amplitude. In addition, a large magnetic circuit is used for realize a low-pitched sound with damping and a high-and high-efficiency range.<br><br>A soft dome type tweeter with a voice coil diameter of 2.54 cm is installed in the high range.<br>The diaphragm of this unit is made of Tetoron, which is resistant to temperature and humidity. In addition, a doughnut-shaped micron glass wool is inserted between the equalizer and diaphragm, and the sound absorbing material at the center of the diaphragm is cut off to enhance the brightness of sound.<br>In addition, by using a large magnet of the same class as LS 700, a high frequency with good articulation is realized.<br><br>A lumber core material is used for the front baffle with an emphasis on brightness in the middle and high range. This plate material uses muku material as a core material, and by sticking single plates on the front and back, it has a bright and nice sound.<br>In addition, a flexible board base stabilizer is used in the top and bottom of the enclosure in order to produce a low sound as heavy as that of a large system, and the reaction caused by the vibration of the woofer is shut out to obtain a low sound.</p>
