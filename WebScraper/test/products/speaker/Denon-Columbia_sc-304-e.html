				<p class="detail">This 3-way speaker system is equipped with a unit jointly developed by DENON and Peerless (Denmark).<br><br>A 25 cm cone type woofer is installed in the low range.<br>In pursuit of linearity, this unit makes use of sound latitude characteristics which is DENON&#39;s original measurement technology in addition to the conventional measurement method, and makes the vibration system and support system closer to the ideal.<br>In addition to using Scandinavian pulp as the material for the cone paper, by adopting the air dry method (the fine airy paper fiber construction) based on the latest technology, we have succeeded in maintaining the soft fiber structure as it is. In addition, by uniformly coating the cone paper with acrylic resin using a special spray, the division vibration of the cone paper in the high frequency range is controlled, and a heavy low sound with less harmonic distortion is realized.<br>In addition, a large flat type damper has been adopted to improve the dynamic linearity by carefully examining the material and impregnation agent. The edge is molded into a roll of foamed polyurethane and the back surface is coated with a damping agent to suppress the resonance of the edge itself, eliminating the mid-range colorization, preventing the leakage of sound waves of different phases from inside the cabinet, and improving the sense of orientation.<br>The voice coil is made of aluminum bobbin with excellent heat radiation effect and reduced diametral deflection. It is treated with high heat-resistant adhesive which shows strong adhesion even at high temperatures to achieve high input resistance.<br><br>In the middle area, it is equipped with a 10 cm cone type skoker which is same as the upper model such as SC 306.<br>The back chamber and frame are integrated by light alloy die-casting to prevent the strong air pressure and vibration from the woofer from adversely affecting the Skoker&#39;s vibration system.<br>The chamber is filled with ring-shaped glass wool to absorb reflected sound, and the chamber inner wall is tapered to prevent standing waves from occurring.<br>The diaphragm uses Peerless and DENON technologies to reduce weight. It also uses non-prescone paper coated with a damping agent on the back. It also uses aluminum voice coil bobbins and rolled edges coated with urethane foam with a damping agent.<br><br>A 3.2 cm soft dome type tweeter is installed in the high range.<br>Light alloy A specially developed woven fabric diaphragm is assembled on a die-cast plate, and the directional characteristics and power response are improved by reducing the effective diameter of the diaphragm.<br>In addition, aluminum is used for the voice coil bobbin to increase heat radiation effect, and heat-resistant treatment is applied to improve input resistance.<br><br>To maximize the power of the unit, the mounting of the tweeter and woofer is a sandwich support system. The tweeter supports the frame from both sides by an aluminum plate and a sealing sheet. The woofer is firmly mounted by an aluminum die-cast ring and a sealing sheet that cover the entire circumference of the frame.<br>In addition, aluminum laminated butyl rubber is applied to part of the back door inside the cabinet to prevent the generation of harmful components in vibration mode.<br><br>Equipped with level control.</p>
