				<p class="detail">This speaker system was developed as a monitor for listening to music instead of checking sound like a studio monitor.<br><br>Equipped with a 20 cm cone type woofer in the low range.<br>The diaphragm uses a unique silk OMF (ONKYO Micro Fiber) diaphragm. This diaphragm uses ultra-fine silk fiber made from natural cocoon yarn with no impurities removed. It has a multi-layered structure made of non-woven fabric with fibers aligned in a certain direction. The direction in which the fibers are aligned is changed. Then, both sides of the fiber layer are bound with unsaturated polyester resin to increase the strength. The silk OMF diaphragm uses a manufacturing method that prevents resin from mixing into the silk fiber layer. Since the silk fiber is in a movable state, the slippage between fibers and between layers acts as a loss, absorbs vibration, and reduces noise generated from the diaphragm itself. The diaphragm shape also uses a structure that increases the strength around the voice coil, suppressing resonance caused by the bell phenomenon, expanding the dynamic range and reducing distortion.<br>OMF edge based on superfine non-woven fabric is used for the edge material supporting the diaphragm, and natural fiber is mixed in the damper to improve linearity and reduce natural vibration.<br><br>The mid-range has a 12 cm cone type mid-range.<br>A silk OMF diaphragm is used for the diaphragm as well as the low-frequency one.<br><br>A 2.5 cm hard-domed tweeter is installed in the high range.<br>The diaphragm is made of aluminum-magnesium alloy, which is lightweight and has high internal loss, and the diaphragm and voice coil bobbin are integrated. Since there is no adhesive between the diaphragm and bobbin, the vibration system can be made lighter and more rigid, and the transmission characteristics can be improved.<br><br>Magnetic distortion reduction technology (MDCT) is used for the magnetic circuit of each unit.<br>In this method, the symmetry of magnetic flux is increased, and the shape and structure which prevent the interference of DC and AC magnetic field are adopted, and non-linear strain, magnetic strain and current strain are reduced.<br><br>The network section is divided into four sections to eliminate mutual inductive interference.<br>In addition, the internal wiring uses a cloth-wound internal wiring cable with a cloth wound around the outer circumference to suppress the effect of vibration.<br><br>The enclosure uses a bass reflex system, and by installing bass reflex ducts on the front and rear surfaces, it is possible to reproduce the sound in the low frequency range that feels wind pressure and to reproduce the sound field spreading in the depth direction more faithfully.<br>MDF with natural sound is used for the entire plate. Especially, 36 mm thick MDF is used for the front baffle plate. In addition, reinforcing ribs are provided inside the cabinet and a special plate set is used to drive the resonance frequency of the cabinet plate beyond the vocal band, dispersing resonance and reducing harmful noise.<br>The exterior is a walnut veneer finish and finished with four layers of glossy paint.<br><br>The input terminal uses a brass machined gold plated terminal.<br>This terminal is compatible with a banana plug, and an extra thick speaker cable can be connected by providing a 6 mm diameter hole in the terminal shaft.</p>
