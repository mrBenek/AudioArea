				<p class="detail">This is a speaker system that uses tall boy design and Mahogany Pure Cabinet, and pursues a sense of reality of sound.<br><br>A 20 cm cone type woofer is installed in the low range.<br>Pulp cone made by German Kurt Mueller is used for the diaphragm. While maintaining the excellent characteristics of pulp, such as moderate internal loss, good response to minute signals, rich timbre, and natural sound field, rigidity is enhanced to improve lightness and stickiness. In addition, rubber edge made by Kurt Mueller that combines flexibility and rigidity is used for the edge.<br>In addition, it uses the spider suspension developed by Victor based on the butterfly damper. The spider suspension uses Bakelite, which is made of hemp cloth as a reinforcement material, to improve accuracy, and improves linearity from small amplitude to large amplitude and long-stroke response.<br><br>Equipped with 6.5 cm soft dome type skoker in the middle area.<br>The diaphragm is made of hemp that can reproduce sound with strong tension and stretch even among natural materials, and it has a natural sound quality with a rich presence.<br><br>A 3.5 cm soft dome type tweeter is installed in the high range.<br>A habutae silk diaphragm is used for the diaphragm of the tweeter. This diaphragm is light and flexible, has excellent transient directional characteristics and excellent start-up at minute input. In addition, after molding the diaphragm, thin-film rubber is applied in multiple layers to increase rigidity.<br><br>All units use Victor&#39;s traditional internal magnetic type alnico magnetic circuit which boasts high magnetic flux and low leakage, and magnetic characteristics are improved by applying special treatment.<br>In addition, by using aluminum die-cast frames for all units, unnecessary vibration is eliminated.<br><br>VICTOR/JVC&#39;s original OFC (oxygen-free copper wire) is used for internal wiring of the network section, and wiring to each unit is independent wiring to prevent internal interference.<br>In addition, the wire is connected by caulking without using solder to eliminate contact loss and realize straight transmission.<br><br>Low-resistance, gold-plated banana plug terminals are used as input terminals.<br><br>The tall boy type enclosure secures a rich low range by securing the internal volume. In addition, the tapered shape reduces standing waves, and all edges are rounded to suppress the diffraction phenomenon and realize a clear sound image. In addition, the baffle surface is slightly inclined in order to align the main sound axis with the ear position when seated.<br><br>The enclosure is made of solid mahogany for the first time in this size. In particular, the baffle is 32 mm thick, the top plate is 25 mm thick, the side plate is 20 mm thick, and the base plate is 30 mm thick to enhance strength and sound quality. In addition, after assembly, the front and back layers are impregnated with a newly developed resin to prevent the aging of solid wood.<br>The exterior has been carefully polished and the joined surface has been finished with flash lafes, taking advantage of the beautiful wood grain unique to mahogany.<br><br>The legs are grounded by a 4-point support system to prevent unwanted vibration, which causes muddy sound. Especially, the front part is grounded directly from the end pin embedded in the baffle plate to realize clear reproduction without muddy sound.<br>The height of the front 2 points can be adjusted, and it can be installed on the floor surface.</p>
