				<p class="detail">This speaker system was developed with the concept of high sensitivity and high efficiency, inheriting the design philosophy of TAD (Technical Audio Devices) and Exclusive S5 in search of the reality of the original sound.<br><br>Two 25 cm cone type woofer using ALCC (alginic acid composite cone) diaphragm is used for the low range.<br>This ALCC diaphragm is made by mixing alginic acid fiber and papermaking in order to increase the bonding force between high strength polyarylate fiber and pulp. Alginic acid fiber extracted from kelp and other seaweeds acts as a binder to increase the bonding force.<br>In addition, the magnetic circuit uses a double magnet magnetic circuit with a canceling magnet, and achieves a high magnetic flux density of 14,300 gauss. In addition, a T-shaped pole is used to obtain a uniform magnetic flux density from front to back, improving the linearity of amplitude against input.<br>In addition, in order to improve response at the time of Oire force and Dainyu force, we have adopted a butterfly-type damper with a revised shape.<br><br>A horn type tweeter is used for the high range.<br>The horn driver is equipped with a rear-type compression driver that provides high resolution and excellent linearity.<br>This compression driver uses the same method as TAD and Exclusive S5. The sound emitted from the diaphragm is guided to the center by a fading plug designed based on fluid dynamics research. The sound is compressed and radiated from the horn. In particular, since the diaphragm is a rear type with the sound generating direction on the rear side, the length of the sound path of the fading plug is the same. There is no phase disturbance of the sound from each slit, and the high-frequency characteristics are excellent.<br>The diaphragm of this driver is made of 3 cm titanium nitride, and a back cover made of aluminum die-cast with excellent vibration resistance is attached to the back of the diaphragm to prevent unnecessary vibration.<br>The horn section is equipped with a large oval wave horn designed with a flared shape to send out spherical waves, thereby realizing a natural sound spread close to a point source.<br>In addition, by rounding the horn opening, the reflection of sound is reduced and the sound is smoothly connected to the outside. The horn shape is oval-shaped, so the horizontal directivity is wide and natural sound can be obtained in a wide range of listening points.<br>For the material of this horn, aluminum die-cast with high molding accuracy and excellent vibration control is adopted.<br>In addition, AFAST (Acoustic Filter Assisted System Tuning), a new technology introduced in TAD, has been introduced, and a resonator is installed in the upper part of the horn. This makes it possible to smooth out changes in phase and to obtain more precise sound localization and reproduction sound.<br><br>In the network section, only elements with a low distortion factor are carefully selected and distributed to each unit to prevent temporal interference between units.<br>In addition, the network board is floated from the enclosure to isolate vibration from each unit.<br><br>In order to prevent unwanted vibration of the baffle from adversely affecting playback sound, the tweeter woofer is fixed by Pioneer&#39;s unique midship mounting method.<br>By fixing the unit inside instead of the baffle, unnecessary vibration of the baffle is reduced.<br><br>The enclosure has two ports on the front to take advantage of the bass reflex effect that enhances the low range.<br>Compared to a single port of the same area, there is less mid-range leakage from the enclosure and less noise turbidity due to interference from the unit.<br>In addition, since the opening uses a special R-shaped elastic body, there is little wind noise and sound waves are emitted smoothly.<br>Furthermore, in order to improve the low-frequency characteristics, it is a large-capacity enclosure with an internal volume of 100L, and the extremely thick baffle is used as a round baffle to prevent the sound diffraction phenomenon.<br>In addition, the material is acoustically examined high-density particle board, and the finish is a flower-like finish in Redish dark brown color.<br><br>There is an attenuator that can adjust the high-frequency level at the bottom of the input terminal. It can be adjusted according to the condition of the room with 2 positions of Normal/Decrease.</p>
