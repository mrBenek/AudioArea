				<p class="detail">A Tik series floor-type speaker system with a unique round enclosure.<br><br>In the low range, 2 pieces of 806J which are 16.5 cm cone type woofer are mounted.<br>This unit uses an injection molded edge that is integrally molded with a polypropylene cone. The movement of the cone with reduced sound loss between the cone and the edge realizes low sound reproduction with excellent linearity and a sense of speed.<br>In addition, it adopts an SFG magnetic circuit with shortening using an edgewise wound flat wire voice coil, and a T-shaped ventilated pole piece with enhanced heat radiation effect.<br>An aluminum die-cast frame is used for the frame, and a slit is provided to release damper back pressure and reduce harmonic distortion.<br>In the Ti10K, the sound pressure level and power handling are improved by the double woofer structure using two units.<br><br>The middle area is equipped with 804 ti which is a 10 cm dome type mid-high.<br>The diaphragm is made of pure titanium and molded into a large-diameter inverted dome shape. In addition, a balanced drive system with a 37 mm diameter voice coil is adopted to achieve accurate piston motion with reduced split vibration.<br>In addition, a high flux neodymium magnet is used for the magnetic circuit, and by adopting an inner magnetic structure with a bucket type frame, the unit itself is magnetically shielded, enabling more accurate driving.<br><br>Ti025K which is a 2.5 cm dome type tweeter is mounted in the high range.<br>The diaphragm uses JBL&#39;s original pure titanium diaphragm. The dome-shaped diaphragm with no reinforcing ribs has a large magnet and an aluminum voice coil that reduces the weight of the vibration system. As a result, the frequency response can be extended to ultra-high frequencies exceeding 30 kHz.<br>In addition, a damping material and a back cavity are provided to absorb the back pressure of the diaphragm, and harmful low-frequency resonance is pushed to a band less than 2 octaves of the crossover frequency, thereby suppressing distortion in the actually used band.<br><br>The network section is independent for each band.<br>Each part uses passive elements such as large coils with reduced DC resistance and high-quality capacitors, glass epoxy boards, and internal wiring materials with less transmission loss.<br><br>A bass-reflex system is used for the enclosure, and a unique round enclosure is used for the overall shape.<br>It consists of a gently sloped front baffle and a smoothly curved side panel that eliminates parallel surfaces from the entire enclosure. This design reduces the generation of internal standing waves and minimizes the use of sound absorbing material, enabling speedy sound reproduction. The baffle width is also minimized to eliminate the Huffle resonance. The curved side panel effectively cancels the sound coming behind the speakers, while at the same time guiding the vibration propagating through the enclosure surface to the one point on the back that has the least influence on sound quality.<br>The front baffle is made of 25 mm thick MDF material, and the side panel is finished into a curved surface by combining 6 layers of MDF material with 2 layers of plates.<br>The opening of the bass reflex port is equipped with a tapered flange made of die-cast with curved treatment to prevent disturbance of air flow in and out.<br><br>A gold-plated speaker input terminal is installed on the bottom of the enclosure to take advantage of the bandwidth configuration of the network section.<br>It is directly connected to the network circuit and can be extended to multi-wiring connection and multi-amplifier drive by combining with optional gold-plated bus bar.<br><br>3-point pinpoint cleats are included to minimize contact with the floor surface for stable installation.<br>Comes with rubber foot to absorb vibration.<br><br>The exterior finish comes in 2 color variations, beach wood grain finish and semi-gloss black finish.</p>
