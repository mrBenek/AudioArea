				<p class="detail">This 3-way speaker system improves power linearity by adopting a special shape linear damper and a new magnetic fluid in addition to the honeycomb diaphragm.<br><br>Each speaker unit uses a honeycomb flat diaphragm that is light and highly rigid.<br>This diaphragm has a planar structure using an aluminum alloy-made honeycomb structure in order to obtain accurate piston motion while eliminating air resonance (front chamber effect) generated in the cavity in front of the cone of a cone-type speaker. Rigidity is 1,000 to 1500 times that of a paper cone. There is no distortion due to deformation caused by Dainyu force, or characteristic degradation due to aging or temperature change.<br>In addition, in order to solve the problem that a part that does not move at all (= node) at a specific frequency occurs when the center of the flat diaphragm is driven, we have adopted a node drive that drives by connecting a voice coil to the node. In addition, in order to cope with the problem that the appearance of nodes differs depending on the shape and frequency of the diaphragm, we have developed a unique axisymmetric honeycomb that increases the density of the honeycomb toward the center. By eliminating the difference in strength between the left and right sides, the node is made into a perfect circle, and node drive with one circular voice coil is possible.<br><br>A 22 cm honeycomb planar woofer is mounted in the low range, and piston motion up to 4 kHz is achieved by nodal driving of 22 cm axisymmetric honeycomb planar diaphragm.<br>The magnetic circuit uses a magnet with a diameter of 120 mm and weight of 640g for high efficiency. The voice coil bobbin can withstand temperatures as high as 200 ℃, and along with the voice coil of heat-resistant specifications, high input resistance is realized.<br>In addition, the linearity at large input is improved by adopting a roll-resistant moltoprene edge at the edge.<br><br>The mid-range uses a 5.2 cm honeycomb plane scoker, and the unique nodal drive enables piston motion up to 15 kHz.<br>In this unit, the air gap around the voice coil and with the pole bead is narrowed as much as possible to improve efficiency. In addition, the voice coil of heat-resistant specifications is adopted to improve input resistance.<br>A convex roll edge is used for the edge to improve linearity at the time of Dainyu force.<br><br>A 2.8 cm honeycomb plane type tweeter is mounted in the high range.<br>In this unit, the magnetic gap is filled with a magnetic fluid with further improved heat dissipation, and by greatly improving the heat dissipation effect, the linearity is improved by stabilizing the impedance and high input resistance is realized.<br>The magnetic fluid also acts as a damper to suppress low-frequency resonance and realizes smooth frequency characteristics.<br><br>A ferrite core with low loss and low distortion is used for the core of the choke coil used in the network, and mutual interference is suppressed by considering the arrangement of parts.<br><br>The tweeter and mid-range offer thermal relay protection.<br>When it is activated, the indicator lights up to confirm it, and you can cancel it with the reset button on the front panel.<br><br>The enclosure is a bass-reflex type and uses a bass-reflex port with a smooth inner surface to reduce air friction inside the port.<br>In addition, a three way Z-frame, which does not change over time, is adopted for the wooden frame.</p>
