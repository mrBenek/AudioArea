				<p class="detail">This speaker system was developed with the aim of creating a speaker system with a heart of compassion that produces a warm sound like a musical instrument, by putting in all the technologies that Diatone engineers have and all the sensitivities they have.<br><br>A 27 cm cone type woofer is installed in the low range.<br>The diaphragm is made of an aramid honeycomb カーブドコーン. The honeycomb cone skin is made of a special matrix resin that contains a flexible resin reinforced with aramid fibers and has a large internal loss.<br>The honeycomb structure is made by bonding the skin material with an aluminum honeycomb core, and the design is optimized by computer simulation. The diaphragm is curved, and the voice coil uses an edgewise coil with precision winding processing. This improves the effective energy and the sense of volume and texture in the low to middle and low range.<br>In addition, Diatone&#39;s unique DMM structure is adopted in the frame part. The whole unit including the magnetic circuit is wrapped in a strong aluminum die-cast frame and supported from the rear. Thus, the magnetic circuit and frame are integrated. This completely suppresses the vibration of the magnetic circuit part and transmits input energy to the diaphragm without loss.<br><br>Mid-range with 5 cm dome mid-range.<br>The diaphragm uses a reinforced diffused boronized DUD diaphragm. By integrating the diaphragm and voice coil bobbin and winding the voice coil directly around the diaphragm, the high-speed response, input resistance, and transient characteristics are greatly improved. The edge uses a tangential edge with a three layer structure of butyl rubber and polyamide fiber with controlled hardness.<br>The frame uses a DM system in which the magnet and frame are integrated to reduce the effect of vibration on the magnetic circuit.<br>In addition, in the DS-10000, the acoustic cover, to which the back pressure from the diaphragm is directly applied, is formed by hand drawing, and the resonance mode is structurally dispersed so that it does not concentrate in one place. In addition, the sub-frame supporting the vibration system through the suspension is made of machined gunmetal with controlled vibration attenuation.<br><br>A 2.3 cm dome-shaped tweeter is installed in the high range.<br>The diaphragm of this unit uses the reinforced diffused boronized DUD with multi-stage drawing, which was first installed in the DS 5000. This multi-stage drawing allows maximum strength to be obtained with a limited vibration diameter, further expanding the excellent characteristics of the diaphragm.<br>As with the mid-range, the sub-frame uses parts made of carved gunmetal. In addition to the strict dimensional accuracy of the movement, the vibration damping of the gunmetal itself realizes high frequency reproduction with a beautiful afterglow.<br><br>All wires in the network section are made of extremely thick linear crystalline oxygen-free copper wires with sufficient wire diameter. All sleeves of the crimping wire are gold-plated to eliminate the metallic boundary strain of the current. In addition, the radial power supply system is adopted to enable the proper current supply to each unit from the thorough review of current density. Thus, the performance and reliability are thoroughly improved.<br>In addition, the network circuit uses a particularly large MP capacitor, and is designed taking into consideration the electromagnetic coupling between the inductors and the modulation caused by the internal pressure of the speaker. In addition, the base material is made of spruce with beautiful attenuation characteristics, and a three piece separation and division structure is adopted.<br><br>The front and rear baffles of the enclosure are made of spruce, which is used as a piano soundboard. In order to match the material characteristics of spruce with the high rigidity unit, the DS-10000 is adopted as a lumber core structure. In addition, the direction of each lumber core material is changed to disperse the resonance mode between the baffle and the rear.<br>The surface of the DS-10000 has a jet-black finish in consideration of acoustic characteristics. The paint used in the DS-10000 has sufficient surface hardness compared with commonly used urethane paint, improving the speed of attack and resolution.<br>Also comes with polishing wax and polishing cloth.<br><br>The DS-10000 is primary aged one by one.<br><br>There was a specially designed speaker stand that was sold separately.</p>
