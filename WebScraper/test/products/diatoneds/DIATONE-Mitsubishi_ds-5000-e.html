				<p class="detail">This is a speaker system developed by Diatone using all sound technology at that time.<br><br>A 40 cm cone type woofer is installed in the low range.<br>An aramid honeycomb diaphragm is used for the diaphragm. Aramid fiber has properties of high strength and high elasticity compared with conventional materials. Moreover, it has excellent characteristics such as low density and moderate internal loss. This aramid fiber is used as a skin material for honeycomb cone. It is impregnated with a special mixture of flexible resin so that the resin itself has a large internal loss. It is made into a honeycomb structure by sandwiching an aluminum honeycomb core. By this method, it is light in weight and high in rigidity, yet has a large internal loss compared with conventional materials. In addition, performance such as E / ρ and internal loss is improved by improving the multi-tuning ventilation cell structure.<br>The magnetic circuit is equipped with the largest magnet and realizes a total magnetic flux of 286,000 Maxwell.<br><br>It is equipped with 25 cm cone type midbus in the middle and low range.<br>As with the woofer unit, an aramid honeycomb diaphragm is used for the diaphragm, while the curved cone is used for the midbus to further increase the high-resonance frequency.<br><br>A 6.5 cm dome type mid-high is installed in the middle and high area.<br>A D. U. D. boron diaphragm is used for the diaphragm. This diaphragm realizes 1/100mm precision integrated molding processing by deep drawing of titanium using a unique molding method, and it is manufactured by subjecting it to high-temperature boronization processing. In addition, the diaphragm used for the DS 5000 has a powerful improvement on boron diffusion growth, and the boronization of the titanium base material is further promoted by crystal growth boron. This, combined with the rigidity of boron, suppresses the natural sound of metal titanium.<br>In addition, we focus on the processing of the sound after leaving the diaphragm, and refine the sound to the range of distant sound separation by tuning suitable for the highest model.<br><br>A 2.3 cm dome-shaped tweeter is installed in the high range.<br>The diaphragm uses a D. U. D. boron dome diaphragm as well as the mid-range diaphragm. In addition, the DS 5000 has a 3-layer sandwich structure consisting of a suspension with a polymer damping sheet as a core material and a fiber film on both sides. This realizes high-speed response and improved transient characteristics.<br><br>A non-resonant prepreg core is used for the inductor of the network, the highest-purity oxygen-free copper winding is used for the winding, and gold plated oxygen-free copper crimp terminals are used for the connecting parts focusing on gold with a small ionization tendency.<br><br>Level control is provided for the middle and high frequencies.<br><br>The enclosure uses a bass reflex system.<br>The DS 5000 enclosure was developed with all the know-how of Diatone, and more than 40 pre-production cabinets have been developed and considered.<br>The baffle plate is cross-laminated with high-quality lauan plywood. The other parts are made of Canadian softwood 2-ply particleboards. Solid walnut material is embedded in the center of the baffle plate to suppress intermodulation distortion caused by interference between middle and low frequencies.<br><br>Two independent pairs of input terminals are provided for low-range and mid-range input terminals. Bi-amplifier connection is possible.<br><br>There was an acoustic cube DK 5000 which is a stand developed exclusively and sold separately.<br>The DK 5000 is made of Canadian maple (Canadian Maple), which has excellent vibration damping characteristics. Moreover, it has a lumbar core structure with 12 blocks. This makes vibration damping more beautiful. You can also adjust the bass characteristics by adjusting the setting method.<br>Comes with oxygen-free copper spacer.<br>In addition to the DS 5000, the DK 5000 can also be used as a setting block for DS 3000, DS 2000 k, DS-1000HR, floor type and bookshelf type speaker systems, CDs, audio equipment such as amplifiers, etc.</p>
