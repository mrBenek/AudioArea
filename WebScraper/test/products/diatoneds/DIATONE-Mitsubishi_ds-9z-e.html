				<p class="detail">This is a speaker system that aims to realize flexible expressive power by introducing DIATONE technology and conducting a thorough review.<br><br><strong>Woofer</strong><br>A 20 cm cone type woofer is installed in the low range.<br><br>The diaphragm uses hybrid weaving of PAN-based high-density carbon fiber and aromatic polyamide-based aramid to achieve a high-dimensional balance between high specific elastic modulus and loss factor.<br>PAN-based high-strength carbon fiber is a fibrous material of carbon-based particles and has an extremely high elastic modulus. Aramid fiber is an aromatic polyamide fiber material with low density and moderate internal loss in addition to high strength and high elasticity. In order to summarize the advantages of these materials in a high dimension, various interrelations such as the blending method of the resin and the relationship with the thermal expansion coefficient are developed into a hybrid structure. This results in a specific elastic modulus of 3.7x10.<sup>11</sup>cm<sup>2</sup>/sec<sup>2</sup>And internal loss of 0.06.<br>In addition, a 22 cm honeycomb diaphragm has been completed by optimizing the carving design through computer simulation.<br><br>The frame uses Diatone&#39;s unique D. M. M. method, and the entire magnetic circuit is firmly fixed with a strong frame to achieve excellent start-up characteristics.<br>In addition, the DS-9Z has a thorough anti-magnetic design to eliminate adverse effects on the network due to leakage flux from the magnetic circuit. The anti-magnetic cover uses spheroidal graphite cast iron to achieve a balance between the anti-magnetic design and rigidity. This material is also used in piano frame structures and has both high rigidity and damping characteristics. Moreover, when mounted on an aluminum die-cast frame, the resonance dispersion effect is enhanced due to the effect of dissimilar metals.<br><br><strong>Tweeter</strong><br>A 2.5 cm dome type tweeter is installed in the high range.<br><br>The diaphragm uses a D. U. D. boron diaphragm developed by Diatone.<br>In the D. U. D system, the voice coil bobbin and diaphragm are integrated to eliminate energy loss and enable high-speed signal propagation.<br>In addition, the DS-9Z has been examined and improved from various angles so that it can be completed as a tweeter suitable for a small 2-way system. As a result, the aperture is set at 1 inch, and acoustic control is applied to optimize the back pressure and resonance inside the diaphragm. In addition, a newly developed edge is used to support the diaphragm with good linearity. This edge uses a material with damping coating on a fine cloth cloth to increase the strength, and a tangential design to improve the tracking performance in minute amplitude.<br><br>The D. M. method is adopted for the frame part, and the magnetic circuit is mounted directly to the enclosure by making the plate part of the magnetic circuit into a mount plate.<br>For the DS-9Z, the D. M. method has been revised from the basic point of view in order to match the higher rigidity with the magnetic shielding design. The sub-frame is made of copper alloy casting with excellent damping characteristics, and the magnetic shielding cover is coated with thick baking paint to enhance the damping effect.<br><br><strong>Network</strong><br>Single-crystal oxygen-free copper wire with increased wire diameter is used for all wiring in the network section, and the sleeve of crimp wiring, which is used to eliminate metallic boundary strain of current, is all gold-plated.<br>In addition, due to a thorough review of the current density, we have adopted a power supply system that can supply the appropriate current to each unit, and to prevent electromagnetic interference between the power supplies to the two units, we have adopted a completely two part distributed configuration for the network.<br><br>In consideration of electromagnetic coupling between inductors and modulation of system internal pressure, a spruce material with excellent vibration damping characteristics is used for the base of the network.<br><br><strong>Enclosure</strong><br>The トラピゾイダル enclosure is used to minimize sound sources and to eliminate unwanted resonance.<br>In an ordinary enclosure, because the top plate and the tweeter are close to each other, the sound in the mid - and high-range region is polluted by resonance of the top plate. Furthermore, unnecessary radiation caused by vibration of the plate from the top plate causes resonance of the entire box. The baffle plate in the vicinity of the mid - and high-range unit as small as possible to reduce the resonance area.<br>To solve these problems, the DS-9Z has a トラピゾイダル shape that achieves both miniaturization and rigidity of the top panel. As a result, the top panel area has been reduced by 20%, rigidity has been increased by approximately 1.5 times, and the diaphragm radiation area near the tweeter has also been reduced by approximately 9%.<br><br>The baffle plate is made of beautiful sounding spruce material, and has a lumber core structure to ensure the best match between material properties and high-rigidity unit.<br><br><strong>Other</strong><br>In order to achieve high purity in the entire system, RUNNET is eliminated and a bolt cap is adopted.<br><br><strong>Dedicated Speaker Stand</strong><br>The DK-90Z sold separately is a newly developed stand exclusively for the DS-9Z. It adopts a unique shape considering low-frequency radiation.<br>Consideration is also given to the lumbar core structure of the stand in order to enhance the completeness of the system as a whole.</p>
