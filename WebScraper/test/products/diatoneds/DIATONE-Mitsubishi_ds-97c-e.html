				<p class="detail">A floor-type speaker system for rich low-frequency playback.<br><br>A 31 cm cone type woofer using an intra-ply hybrid honeycomb cone is mounted in the low range.<br>The Intra-Ply Hybrid Honeycomb Cone uses a hybrid weaving skin material of PAN-based high-strength carbon fiber and aromatic polyamide aramid for the front skin and a cellulose fiber skin for the back skin. This hybrid structure realizes a high specific elastic modulus and moderate internal loss.<br><br>Equipped with 12 cm cone type skoker in the middle area.<br>The diaphragm is made of a hybrid weaving skin material woven with aramid and carbon at a ratio of 1 : 2. It is lightweight, highly rigid, and has high internal loss. In addition, a 2-ply structure using carbon cloth skin material realizes high specific elastic modulus and high loss factor. The center diaphragm is made of S. R. Titanium Dome, which achieves both high specific elastic modulus and loss factor by surface hardening of titanium. The hybrid structure of dome diaphragm and cone diaphragm makes sound connection smooth.<br>Roll edge with excellent linearity of amplitude is used for the edge part, and wooden back chamber is used for the mid-range to ensure sufficient volume and high strength to prevent interference with low range.<br><br>A 2.5 cm dome type tweeter is installed in the high range.<br>The diaphragm is made of Diatone&#39;s original diaphragm, Boron, and the diaphragm and voice coil bobbin are integrated into a D. U. D structure. The driving force generated in the voice coil bobbin is transmitted to the diaphragm without any loss, thereby improving transient response, high upper limit frequency, linearity and input resistance.<br>The D. M. (Direct Mount), which is a highly rigid unit structure, is also a hybrid structure. The entire plate is mounted with aluminum-alloyed sting in order to attenuate the natural resonance of the magnetic circuit itself. As a result, in addition to high rigidity, an appropriate damping property is obtained.<br><br>All units have an anti-magnetic design with anti-magnetic structure.<br>In order to suppress the natural sound radiated from the surface of the unit mounting bolt, a damping bolt cap is used for all units.<br><br>A low-distortion air-core coil is used for the tweeter coil in the network part to transmit sound without coloring.<br>In addition, interference between each unit and network is eliminated by independent power supply system and split network arrangement, and crimp wiring is used for connection system.<br><br>The front baffle uses a 2-side round baffle to reduce the diffraction effect.<br><br>The enclosure is designed as a bass reflex with a volume of approximately 80 liters.<br>The front baffle is made of 2-plywood with a thickness of 30 mm, and resonance is suppressed by obtaining sufficient strength. In addition, by mounting the woofer almost in the center of the baffle plate, low-order standing waves generated especially in the vertical direction are suppressed. In addition, by dispersing the resonance frequency by the reinforcement material, the use of sound absorbing material which applies excessive damping to the low range is minimized.<br>The bass reflex port uses 5 mm thick inorganic filler mixed polypropylene. This port has a shape with a gentle vent and changes from a perfect circle at the inlet section to an elliptic shape without changing the cross-sectional area. This prevents high-order standing waves inside the cabinet from being radiated from the duct and reduces the flow path resistance. This shape also reduces the natural resonance of the duct itself.<br><br>The net grill has a large open side to increase the rigidity of the double frame and make it a structure with good permeability.<br><br>A dedicated acoustic base is included.</p>
