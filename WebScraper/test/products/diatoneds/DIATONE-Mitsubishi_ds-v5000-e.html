				<p class="detail">This 4-way floor type speaker system was developed as the second product of the DS-V series by introducing Diatone technology.<br><br>It has a 32 cm cone woofer in the low range and an 18 cm cone midbus unit in the middle and low range.<br><br>Super Aramid Honeycomb diaphragm made of Super Aramid Fiber is used for the diaphragm of Woofer and Midbus.<br>Super Aramid Fiber has high strength, excellent vibration damping characteristics, low mass (25% lighter than carbon fiber), and a large increase in elastic modulus of 40%. Super Aramid Fiber is used as the skin material of honeycomb vibration plate and is hybrid structure with excellent core material to ensure excellent specific elastic modulus and moderate internal loss equal to paper.<br><br>The A.D. M.C. - I (Advanced Magnet Circuit-impulse) is used for the magnetic circuit of Woofer and Midbus.<br>In the A. D. M. C., AC magnetic flux from the voice coil is offset by double conductive rings on the center pole. This suppresses magnetostriction caused by the superposition of DC magnetic flux and AC magnetic flux. In addition, disturbance of DC magnetic flux due to AC magnetic flux in the magnetic circuit is also reduced. Stability and low distortion are realized.<br>The A.D. M.C. - I developed the basic theory of the A.D. M.C. and realized high-speed response by adding the examination of AC magnetic field analysis. In A.D. M.C. - I, response to input signals is increased by placing a strain suppression ring with optimum dimensions, shape and property values. In addition, the AC magnetic flux density component passing through the magnet is minimized, and vibration at the operating point of the magnetic circuit due to DC magnetic flux is suppressed, thereby stabilizing the operation of the magnetic circuit against transient response. In addition, stability in the time domain against AC magnetic field is improved by suppressing the total amount of generated AC magnetic flux density component and improving symmetry.<br><br>The midbus unit is provided with a magnetic shielding of spheroidal graphite cast iron to eliminate electromagnetic interference.<br>A back chamber is also used to prevent interference caused by internal standing waves.<br><br>A 6.0 cm dome mid-high unit is installed in the middle and high range, and a 2.3 cm dome type tweeter is installed in the high range.<br><br>B for the diaphragm of mid-high and tweeter<sub>4</sub>C (pure boron) diaphragm is adopted.<br>B<sub>4</sub>C is 5 times as large as that of titanium and 2.2 times as large as that of a titanium boronized diaphragm (sound velocity value 12.1 × 10).<sup>11</sup>cm<sup>2</sup>/sec<sup>2</sup>The sound velocity, which indicates the propagation speed of sound, has excellent physical properties exceeding 11,000m/sec in actual measurement. Moreover, the internal loss has a high value that cannot be achieved with a metal-based diaphragm. However, B<sub>4</sub>While C has excellent properties, it has a very high melting point of 2,450 ℃, which makes it extremely difficult to form it into a dome shape.<br>In diatone, B is produced by a unique plasma spraying method.<sub>4</sub>C is melted in an ultra-high-temperature plasma flame of 15,000 ℃ or higher, and sprayed at high speed onto the surface of an object to form a film. After spraying, it is fired at high temperature in an inert gas atmosphere to produce B<sub>4</sub>By strengthening the coupling between C particles, a pure boron diaphragm with uniformly distributed pores has been realized.<br><br>B<sub>4</sub>In order to make the best use of the superior characteristics of the C-diaphragm, the Mid-High and Tweeter are equipped with a high-rigidity diaphragm structure D. U. D and a high-rigidity unit structure D. M. (direct mount).<br>In the D. U. D structure, the driving force generated in the voice coil can be transmitted without loss by integrating the diaphragm and voice coil bobbin, and it is firmly mounted in the enclosure in the D. M., and the monocoque structure directly mounting the plate part of the magnetic circuit realizes a robust unit.<br><br>The protective nets for the mid-high and tweeter use a hybrid structure of hard steel wire and copper wire.<br><br>A flat surface is used to reduce the adverse effect on sound caused by the unevenness of the frame. A vibration-proof cap with fewer protrusions is attached to the set screw that mounts the unit to the enclosure to provide continuity with the frame, thereby suppressing the diffraction of sound waves and preventing reflection.<br>In addition to the use of damping material for the set screw, we also use special paint with damping effect for unnecessary radiation from the frame and plate to completely suppress unnecessary radiation.<br><br>If the units are arranged close to each other in order to realize the optimum sound image localization of a 4-way 4-speaker system, the frames of the middle and low frequency units will disturb the sound radiation of the middle and high frequency units.<br>In order to prevent this, an elastic material with less unnecessary radiation is used for the middle and low frequency frames, and diffraction is effectively prevented by providing a large number of small spherical projections on the surface of which the shape and dimensions of the optimum micro-domains are calculated.<br><br>The network section is designed by computer simulation and uses components with minimal DC resistance and distortion.<br>It uses capacitors that have been selected through repeated measurements and viewing, crimping wiring with a oxygen-free copper wire sleeve that reduces metal-interface distortion and realizes high reliability, and high-purity oxygen-free copper is used for internal wiring.<br><br>Uses a large gold plated input terminal.<br><br>The front baffle is a large rounded baffle made of 38 mm thick Siberian karamatsu wood cross-glued with a solid and beautiful sound. The rear baffle is made of Sitka spruce lumber core with excellent attenuation and beautiful sound used in piano materials. The other parts are made of Canadian conifer 2-ply particle board.<br>In addition, walnut veneer is pasted on both sides of each plate to realize high rigidity and weather resistance.<br><br>The top panel of the enclosure uses a solid material set-in structure with excellent damping characteristics and emphasis on beautiful sound, and the acoustic strength of the cabinet edge is improved.<br>The internal structure adopts the Diatone traditional distributed resonance structure.<br><br>Exterior is finished with urethane coating.</p>
