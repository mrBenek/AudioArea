				<p class="detail">This is a limited model speaker system that uses DS 20000 as a base and has been further matured and fine-tuned as a piano finish &quot;Clavier&quot;.<br><br>All units were reviewed in accordance with the development theme of &quot;sound&quot;, and piano soundboard grade material was used for the enclosure, and it was completed after detailed tuning and thorough hearing.<br><br><br><strong>Woofer</strong><br>A 27 cm cone type woofer is installed in the low range.<br><br>An aramid honeycomb cone is used for the diaphragm. This diaphragm has a honeycomb structure with high bending rigidity and uses aramid aromatic polyamide organic fiber with excellent skin properties. By obtaining a large thickness and a high sound velocity value, the distortion caused by the diaphragm is minimized. In addition, by having a larger internal loss than paper, the harmonic distortion is reduced. In addition, the DS 20000 b has a triaxial woven aramid edge that exhibits uniform strength in all directions at the edge part, and achieves piston motion with excellent linearity and less rolling.<br><br><br><strong>Mid-range</strong><br>The mid-range features a 7.5 cm dome mid-range.<br><br>B for the diaphragm<sub>4</sub>Uses C Pure Boron DUD vibration plate.<br>B<sub>4</sub>C has a specific elastic modulus five times higher than that of titanium and second to that of crystalline diamond. Even at the sound velocity value, the measured value of C is 11,000m/sec, and the internal loss is 0.01, which is one order of magnitude higher than that of titanium or beryllium. Because this material has a very high melting point, it was difficult to form it into a dome shape. However, at Diatone, this has been realized with high precision by introducing plasma spraying method and high-precision computer control robot.<br>In addition, in the DUD (Diatone Unified Diaphargm) structure adopted for the diaphragm, the voice coil bobbin and diaphragm are integrated, and transmission loss of driving force is suppressed by directly driving the diaphragm, and high-speed rise of sound with less distortion in high-frequency range is realized.<br><br>For the magnetic circuit, ADMC-m (Advanced Magnet Circuit-music) magnetic circuit using ring-shaped alnico cast magnet is adopted.<br>ADMC-m is a magnetic circuit that reduces the influence of the magnetic field generated from the input signal by analyzing the magnetic field using the finite element method. It has excellent response to the input, and achieves good transient and low distortion by realizing stable driving.<br><br>DM (Direct Mount) system is adopted for the frame part.<br>In this system, taking advantage of the structure of the dome unit itself, the magnetic circuit is fixed directly to the enclosure by the frame-shaped monocoque structure, which realizes higher rigidity and transmits the input signal to the diaphragm without loss.<br><br><br><strong>Tweeter</strong><br>B for the high range as well as the mid-range<sub>4</sub>It is equipped with a 2.3 cm dome type tweeter using C pure boron DUD vibration plate.<br><br><br><strong>Enclosure</strong><br>The enclosure is sealed, and the baffle and back plate are made of a piano soundboard material, spruce.<br>The DS 20000 b enclosure has been hand-finished by skilled craftsmen to create a solid enclosure with no looseness or gaps.<br>The exterior is finished with a black piano finish with polyester thick glossy paint.<br><br><br><strong>Other</strong><br>The input terminal uses a gold-plated large terminal that can securely fix extremely thick wires and can also be connected to banana plugs.<br>It also has four inputs and can be used for bi-amp and bi-wiring.<br><br>The DS 2000 b Diatone Kobo had primary aged each unit before shipping them.<br><br>There was a special speaker stand sold separately.</p>
