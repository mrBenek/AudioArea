				<p class="detail">A speaker system developed as a next-generation speaker for Diatone.<br><br><strong>Woofer</strong><br>A 32 cm cone type woofer using carbon graphite honeycomb cone is mounted in the low range.<br><br>The Carbon Graphite Honeycomb Cone is a honeycomb construction cone unique to Diatone. It satisfies the requirements for low-frequency units such as light mass, high rigidity, moderate internal loss, and large bending rigidity. The DS-77EX uses carbon graphite composite with high specific elastic modulus as a new skin material. Combined with the newly developed honeycomb core, it achieves low strain, low resonance, and excellent high-speed response.<br><br>For the DS-77EX, we pay attention to the frame structure and have developed and adopted a unique R. S. (High Rigid Support) frame.<br>The frame is a rigid 8-legged frame with alternating legs to reduce resonance and disperse resonance modes, thereby increasing the rigidity of the frame and magnetic circuit and reducing vibration of the magnetic circuit.<br><br><strong>Skorker</strong><br>The mid-range is equipped with a 10 cm cone type squaker.<br><br>1000 filament carbon cloth cone is used for the diaphragm.<br>This diaphragm is made of 1000-filament carbon cloth, which is made from 10 carbon fiber filaments as one thread. This realizes a broadband unit that is light, highly elastic, excellent in damping characteristics, and low in natural sound.<br>In addition, the center cap has a specific elastic modulus approximately 40% higher than that of untreated titanium, and uses super ω - titanium, which is light in mass and hard, to improve the characteristics of the high-frequency part.<br><br>High-precision tangential edge is used for the edge part.<br>The edge is made of a laminated cloth consisting of two sheets of cloth coated with damping material, which improves the rise of the sound and reduces the squeal in the mid-range.<br><br>The frame part uses the R. S. frame as well as the woofer.<br><br><strong>Tweeter</strong><br>A 2.5 cm dome type tweeter is installed in the high range.<br><br>The diaphragm material uses super ω - titanium, which has undergone a special surface hardening treatment in addition to ω - titanium.<br>Super ω - titanium has more than 40% higher specific elastic modulus than untreated titanium, greatly expanding the regeneration bandwidth. The film also forms a three layer structure with different physical properties in the diaphragm structure, reducing the noise that is often seen in metal diaphragms.<br>In addition, the DS-77EX employs a D. U. D. structure in which the diaphragm and voice coil bobbin are integrated to eliminate high resonance frequencies outside the audible band. In addition, the DS-77EX eliminates energy loss at the bonded part and transmits the driving force generated in the voice coil without loss, greatly improving response to input signals.<br><br>The D. M. system is adopted for the frame structure, and high rigidity is achieved by the monocoque structure in which the magnetic circuit is framed.<br><br><strong>Network</strong><br>OFC with low DC resistance is used for all connections in the network section. In addition, a crimping wiring method is adopted in which wires are passed through a sleeve and the sleeve is crimped and crimped. This reduces distortion at the interface caused by dissimilar metals.<br><br>The wiring after the input terminal is completely independent between each unit, eliminating interference between each unit and network.<br><br>Since the Woofer coil generates a particularly large magnetic flux, the coil is divided into two sections to eliminate intermodulation.<br><br><strong>Enclosure</strong><br>A 4-side round baffle structure has been adopted for the front baffle of the enclosure, and the diffraction effect is suppressed by rounding the four sides of the top, bottom, left and right, and it improves the middle and high range.<br><br>The internal structure of the enclosure employs a highly rigid and distributed resonance structure that makes full use of modal analysis. By analyzing vibration modes from the entire structure and maintaining their balance, high-resolution reproduction is possible.<br>It is made of carefully selected high-density chip board with high rigidity and low natural sound. The rigidity of the enclosure itself is increased for low frequency modes, and the dispersion resonance type structure unique to Diatone is used for medium and high frequency modes.<br><br>The DS-77EX comes in two color variations : dark brown and black.</p>
