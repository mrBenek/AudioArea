				<p class="detail">This is a bookshelf speaker system developed using Diatone&#39;s unique technology such as the DUD structure.<br><br>A 32 cm cone type woofer is installed in the low range.<br>A new type of pre-cone has been developed and used for the diaphragm. This cone paper has been specially molded to increase the thickness of the peripheral part and to increase the density. It increases the strength without losing its lightness and expands the piston motion band.<br>In addition, a low-distortion magnetic circuit is adopted for the magnetic circuit to reduce the distortion generated from the drive system. In the low-distortion magnetic circuit, a special nickel-based alloy developed from a metallurgical engineering approach is mounted on the surface of magnetic materials such as pole pieces to improve the non-uniformity of magnetic flux distribution and to propose distortion.<br>The frame uses die-cast frame to reduce resonance.<br><br>The mid-range is equipped with a 10 cm cone type squaker.<br>The cone paper is made from the well-known dry prescone. In addition, the center cap made from thin duralumin sheet and subjected to appropriate damping treatment, and the Cross Edge coated with special damping material are used to suppress singing in the middle and high frequency range.<br><br>A 4 cm semi-dome type tweeter is installed in the high range.<br>The diaphragm is made of titanium alloy with high hardness and light mass, and a clear high sound range is obtained by suppressing split vibration. In addition, a DUD structure in which the diaphragm and the voice coil bobbin are integrally molded is adopted in consideration of energy loss generated at the joint between the voice coil bobbin and the diaphragm. This structure has been realized by deep drawing of titanium alloy, which had been difficult in the past. Since vibration of the voice coil bobbin is directly transmitted to the diaphragm, transient characteristics with good response and excellent pulsed sound are obtained. In addition, the area where heat generated from the voice coil bobbin escapes is expanded, and input resistance performance is improved.<br><br>A low-distortion network circuit is adopted in which the elements constituting the network circuit are carefully selected.<br>This circuit uses a metallized polyester film capacitor with excellent high-frequency characteristics, an electrolytic capacitor with low distortion and low leakage current and dielectric loss, and a coil with laminated orient core with low DC resistance impregnated with special varnish.<br>In addition, each device is firmly fixed, and attention is paid to the arrangement and wiring method of components so as to reduce interference between components. In addition, high-conductivity oxygen-free copper wires are used for internal wiring to enable high-purity transmission.<br><br>It is equipped with a level control that allows 4-step switching in each of the middle and high ranges, and can be adjusted according to the situation.<br><br>The front baffle has a vertical single row unit arrangement to improve the directivity of the high frequency range, and the left and right speakers have a symmetrical shape to improve sound image localization.<br><br>The enclosure is carefully designed through repeated modal analysis and hearings.<br>In addition, in order to increase the rigidity and confidentiality of the box, we have adopted a joint structure called &quot;wrapping and retaining hozo joint&quot; for the baffle plate joint. In addition, the resonance mode is dispersed by the distributed resonance structure with reinforcement placed in the right place to suppress the box ringing.</p>
