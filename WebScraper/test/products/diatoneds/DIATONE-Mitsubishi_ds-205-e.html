				<p class="detail">This speaker system was developed by returning to the original sound of a small-diameter woofer with a large-capacity enclosure.<br><br>A 20 cm cone type woofer is installed in the low range.<br>The diaphragm is made of lightweight and highly rigid aramid cloth cone. The aramid cloth cone uses aramid, an aromatic polyamide organic fiber with high strength and moderate internal loss, as a cone material. In addition, the weight is reduced by eliminating the conventional epoxy resin binder with a two layer structure. It is also able to take advantage of the large internal loss of aramid and improve the effect of reducing natural sound.<br>In addition, the DS 205 has an artificial leather edge and is equipped with an ADMC magnetic circuit that uses an alnico magnet for the magnetic circuit to achieve low distortion.<br><br>A 5 cm cone type tweeter which inherited the technology of 2S-3003 is mounted in the high range.<br>In this unit, B which has high specific elastic modulus next to crystal diamond is used.<SUB>4</SUB>C (pure boron) has been adopted for the cone type, and the support system has been revised.<br>Artificial leather is placed around the unit to suppress unwanted vibrations and primary reflected sound of acoustic waves.<br><br>Attention has been paid to the design of the cabinet and the bass reflex port. In order to make the woofer unit sound freely, the capacity is kept large at 80 liters and the bass reflex port is also set large to reduce the back pressure applied to the unit. The balance between the cabinet capacity, the bass reflex port diameter, and the unit diameter is determined by the cut and try of the balance which sounds the most comfortable in listening feeling by the repeated trial listening.<br>In addition, the large diameter round of R80 is held in the side plate, and it goes around from the front and back and is joined to the baffle and back plate. This has the effect of dispersing the vibration support point of the whole cabinet against the vibration from the unit and suppresses the disturbance of the tooth surface caused by the diffraction phenomenon of the sound wave emitted from the unit. The side plate is made of 11 sheets of strong and dense beech plywood cross-laminated to ensure high rigidity. In addition, the inside joint is made of Canadian Maple, which is also used for pianos, etc., to realize a beautiful sound.<br>The cabinet is hand-finished by skilled craftsmen.<br><br>It supports bi-amplifier / bi-wiring and uses a large gold-plated speaker terminal that can also be connected to banana terminals.<br><br>There was a speaker stand that was specially designed for both design and sound quality.</p>
