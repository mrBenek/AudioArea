				<p class="detail">This speaker system is the 50th anniversary model of the Diatone Kobo. While inheriting the blood line of the broadcast station monitor, it also emphasizes musical expression such as the warmth of human voice and the luster of string instruments.<br><br>The DS-A3 uses a cone-shaped 2-way system, which is the system configuration of the broadcasting station monitor 2S-3003.<br>In addition, by using the same material for the diaphragm of woofer and tweeter, the speed of sound is made uniform and it becomes equal sound speed 2-way.<br><br>A 16 cm cone type woofer is installed in the low range.<br>The diaphragm is made of an aramid cone. The aramid fiber is light and strong, and has the ideal characteristics of suppressing natural sound and reproducing uncolored sound. The DS-A3 is close to the warmth of human voice, while the Woofer is made of resin, which used to form the aramid diaphragm, to enhance the strength and flexibility of the aramid fiber.<br>The magnetic circuit is equipped with a unique A. D. M. C. -m (Advanced Magnet Circuit-music). By analyzing the magnetic field using the finite element method, the influence of the magnetic field generated from the input signal is suppressed, and by realizing stable drive with excellent response to input, good transient and low distortion are realized.<br><br>A 4 cm cone type tweeter using an aramid cone is installed in the high range.<br><br>The network section emphasizes musical performance and employs a high-purity network conforming to DS 20000. In addition, a method for optimally tuning the energy balance to each unit is employed.<br>With regard to wiring, we have eliminated the need for soldering to reduce the strain at the metallic interface. Instead, we use a oxygen-free copper sleeve for crimping wiring. In addition, for high-quality playback, we use parts that have been subjected to repeated trial listening, such as laminated orient cores, capacitors, and coils.<br><br>The enclosure is designed using computer technology such as the finite element method, and is designed based on numerical values obtained by analyzing the vibration of the enclosure to achieve an extremely rigid structure.<br>The baffle plate that supports the unit is 46 mm thick and has a walnut veneer finish. In addition, both sides of the baffle are made of natural Canadian maple with a beautiful sound. It is designed to sound music with a natural warmth. In addition, the upper and lower ends of the baffle are made of natural walnut. In consideration of the characteristics of the wood, the right material is placed in the right place.<br>In order to create a beautiful sound field with a sense of scale, the bass resonance frequency is tuned to the order of 40 hz, which is a reduction of the contrabass. The opening of this bass port is fitted with a large oval port carved out of solid walnut, and the inside is designed as a bent angle port. This makes it possible to play back low sound with a sense of scale.<br><br>The large round-shaped baffle used in the 2S 3003 and artificial leather around the high-frequency unit prevent the diffraction phenomenon and diffuse reflection of sound.<br><br>The input terminal uses a large gold-plated terminal to which a banana plug can be connected.<br><br>There was a special speaker stand sold separately.<br>The height of the stand is designed to meet your ears when you lean on the sofa. In addition, the center of the stand pillar is made of solid Canadian maple, a three layer structure with high density and beautiful sound.</p>
