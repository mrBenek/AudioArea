				<p class="detail">A speaker system developed as a music reference for high-sampling digital audio.<br><br>A 30 cm cone type woofer is installed in the low range.<br>Aramid honeycomb is used for the diaphragm. Aramid fiber is an aromatic polyamide long fiber with high strength, high elasticity, light weight and moderate internal loss. This material is used as a skin material and H. D. (high damping) alloy is sandwiched as a honeycomb core.<br>3-axis woven aramid fiber is used for the edge that supports the diaphragm. By demonstrating strength in all directions, dispersion resonance at high input is suppressed. In addition, by entwining special damping agent into the fiber, high-order natural resonance of the diaphragm and edge itself is suppressed, and the texture is improved.<br>The magnetic circuit is equipped with A. D. M. C. -m (Advanced Magnet Circuit-music) to improve response to input signals.<br><br>The mid-range features a 6 cm dome mid-range.<br>B for the diaphragm<sub>4</sub>Uses C Pure Boron. B<sub>4</sub>C has a high specific elastic modulus second only to crystalline diamond and moderate internal loss, and is used in the D. U. D structure which is the diaphragm structure of the Diatone tradition to obtain excellent response. B<sub>4</sub>C has a very high melting point of 2,450 ℃, so it was said that it was impossible to mold with conventional technology. However, Diatone has solved this problem by its unique plasma spraying method.<br>The magnetic circuit uses a hybrid D. M. with a highly rigid frame structure. The plate portion is directly fixed to the baffle plate and wrapped in aluminum alloy stings to improve the S/N feeling.<br><br>A 2.3 mm dome type tweeter is installed in the high range.<br>B for Tweeter as well as mid-range<sub>4</sub>C pure boron boron diaphragm has a D. U. D structure, enabling high-speed playback with less signal transmission loss. Hybrid D. M. is used for the magnetic circuit and frame structure, enabling high-quality playback.<br><br>The network section employs an independent power supply system that eliminates mutual interference between units, and a distributed configuration to suppress current modulation caused by interference between network elements.<br>The tweeter&#39;s high-pass filter uses carefully selected elements with particularly excellent high-frequency characteristics. It uses uncompromising parts such as capacitors with low tan δ and unique air-core coils. In addition, it uses crimping wiring without soldering to increase signal purity.<br><br>The input terminal uses a large gold-plated terminal for extremely thick cables and banana plugs.<br><br>The handcraft technology of Diatone Kobo is used for the enclosure.<br>In order to suppress the diffraction phenomenon of sound, the front baffle adopts a 2-side round baffle with a large roundness, and the top edge is finished with a soft curved shape of Canadian Maple which is a high-quality real wood to give a beautiful sound. In addition, the body plate is finished with a walnut thrust plate to improve the speed of attack and resolution.<br>The interior uses a highly rigid distributed resonance structure.<br><br>A special speaker stand is used and sold separately.<br>This stand is made of ceramic material with high rigidity and low resonance structure. In addition, the front side, which is delicate for sound quality, is reinforced with wood to promote low resonance structure.<br>The stand consists of five legs to ensure that the entire weight of the speaker rests firmly on the floor. The top supporting the speaker is designed to be either four or three point support so that the sound of the bottom plate can be controlled appropriately. The speaker also comes with a spacer for fine tuning of sound quality.</p>
