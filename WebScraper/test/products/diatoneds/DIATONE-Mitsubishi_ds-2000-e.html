				<p class="detail">A high-density and high-resolution speaker system designed to achieve high-speed start-up response.<br><br>In the development of the DS 2000, digital measurement was introduced ahead of the industry. Problems in time domain response are discovered through modal analysis and energy time response analysis, and the results of each research and analysis are fed into each department to enhance the completeness.<br><br><strong>Woofer</strong><br>A 30 cm cone shaped woofer with Diatone&#39;s unique honeycomb construction cone is installed in the low range.<br>In the DS 2000, high-tensile polyamide fiber is used for the skin material, and along with the development of special matrix resins, the diaphragm itself is reduced in strain. In addition, the カーブドコーン shape is used to reduce high-order harmonic distortion, and the upper limit frequencies are expanded.<br><br>The voice coil bobbin uses a polyimide film that has three times the specific elastic modulus of conventional aromatic polyamide film and excellent heat and cold resistance. This improves input resistance and response to input signals.<br><br>DMM (Direct Magnet Circuit Mount) system is adopted for the frame part.<br>In this system, the whole unit including the magnetic circuit is wrapped in a strong aluminum die-cast frame pressed from the rear so that the magnetic circuit and the frame are effectively integrated.<br>In addition, the DS 2000 incorporates new technologies such as 8-frame and uniform 8-point fastening based on vibration analysis using a vibration pickup. By integrating the frame and fastening screws, resonance of the magnetic circuit and frame is suppressed.<br><br><strong>Skorker</strong><br>A 6 cm dome type squaker using a newly designed 60 mm reinforced diffused boron D. U. D. diaphragm is mounted in the middle area.<br><br>The diaphragm structure of this unit uses Diatone Unified Diaphragm (D. U. D.).<br>In this structure, the diaphragm and voice coil bobbin are integrated by a simple structure in which the voice coil is wound directly on the diaphragm, and the driving force generated by the voice coil is directly transmitted to the diaphragm without loss. Therefore, the damping of the high frequency range is small, and the transient response to the input vibration is improved. In addition, there is no decrease in rigidity due to adhesion, and the upper limit frequency can be set high, and the increase in conductor resistance due to temperature rise is reduced by the excellent heat radiation effect, and linearity and input resistance are improved.<br><br>Boron is used for the diaphragm.<br>Boron is second only to diamond in hardness and has excellent acoustic properties such as specific elastic modulus. At the same time, boron has physical properties closer to magnetism than metals. By this property, characteristics at the resonance frequency can be smoothed, and neither braking nor acoustic equalization to the diaphragm itself is required, thus realizing an ideal diaphragm.<br>In addition, in order to further develop the characteristics of the boron diaphragm in the DS 2000, boron diffusion growth is strongly promoted, and boronization of the titanium base metal is promoted by crystal growth boron to improve the completion of the diaphragm.<br>In addition, the diaphragm itself is a no-treatment diaphragm that does not use any damping material to take advantage of the excellent response characteristic of the D. U. D structure.<br><br>DM (direct mount) system is adopted for the frame part.<br>In this system, the magnetic circuit itself is made into a frame by integrating the magnetic circuit and the frame into a monocoque structure, and by mounting it directly into the enclosure, the rigidity of the whole unit is increased. In addition, by comprehensively examining magnetic flux density, magnetic flux leakage, rigidity, etc., and determining the optimum shape and dimensions using a finite element method using a computer, high-density mid-range reproduction is achieved.<br>In addition, the plate portion is 8 mm thick with allowance, and it is fixed to the baffle plate at 8 equal points in high rigid incorporation, and the unit input terminal position and structure are also devised in order to minimize the diameter of the baffle.<br><br><strong>Tweeter</strong><br>The high-frequency band is equipped with a 2.3 cm dome type tweeter using an enhanced diffused boron D. U. D. diaphragm in the same way as the mid-frequency band. In addition, the DM system is adopted in the frame part to improve the rise characteristics.<br><br><strong>Network</strong><br>In order to reduce the effects of electromagnetic interference between network circuits and vibration of the enclosure, a 3-piece separation and division method is adopted for the network section. In addition, the mounting position is optimized by modal analysis. In addition, a oxygen-free copper sleeve crimping method is adopted for wiring to reduce the strain at the metallic interface.<br>In addition, the DS 2000 adopts a direct balance power supply system using a radial power distribution plate to supply power to each unit under the same conditions.<br><br><strong>Enclosure</strong><br>The enclosure is designed using modal analysis and other computer-based vibration analysis technology.<br>In the DS 2000, materials with high rigidity and low natural sound are selected. The high-order mode is suppressed by the dispersion resonance structure of the Diatone tradition, and the low-order mode increases the rigidity of the enclosure itself as a box to balance the vibration as a whole. In addition, the joint strength of 6 especially important enclosures is also examined. The machining accuracy of the joint surface is improved by improving the accuracy of the machine tool, and a sturdy box assembly is realized by joining with strong adhesive and reinforcing with angle block.</p>
