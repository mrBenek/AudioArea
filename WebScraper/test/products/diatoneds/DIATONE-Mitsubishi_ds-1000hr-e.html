				<p class="detail">This speaker system was developed by applying the technologies cultivated in the DS-10000.<br><br><br><strong>Woofer</strong><br>A 27 cm cone type woofer is installed in the low range.<br><br>The diaphragm uses polyamide, honeycomb and カーヴドコーン.<br>The honeycomb vibration plate has a high specific elastic modulus and most of the volume (about 90%) is an air layer, so the density is 0.1 to 0.25g/cm.<SUP>3</SUP>The DS-1000HR uses high-tensile polyamide fiber, a long-fiber-reinforced composite material, for the skin of the diaphragm to further improve the quality of the diaphragm. The DS-1000HR also uses a カーヴド cone shape to reduce high-order harmonic distortion in the low-frequency range expand the high-limit frequencies.<br><br>The frame structure adopts the DMM method.<br>In this system, the whole unit including the magnetic circuit is strongly supported from the rear by a strong aluminum die-cast frame. The magnetic circuit and the frame are effectively integrated. This reduces vibration of the magnetic circuit and the frame. Furthermore, the S/N ratio is further improved by adding a new concept of damping control to suppress resonance of the second and third higher modes.<br><br><br><strong>Skorker</strong><br>The mid-range features a 5.0 cm dome mid-range.<br><br>50 mm boron DUD dome has been adopted for the diaphragm.<br>The DUD used in the structure of the diaphragm is an integrated diaphragm and voice coil bobbin. It can transmit the driving force generated in the voice coil to the diaphragm without loss. As a result, characteristics such as improved transient response, higher upper limit frequency, improved linearity and input resistance have been achieved.<br>In addition, in the DS-1000HR, the diffusion growth of boron used for the diaphragm material has been further improved, and the boronization of titanium base metal is further promoted by crystal growth boron, and the perfection as a diaphragm is enhanced.<br><br>Laminated tangential edge of Conex base material with double-sided butyl coating is used for the support part of the diaphragm.<br><br>DM system is adopted for the frame part.<br>This system has a monocoque structure in which the magnetic circuit and frame are integrated. By mounting the magnetic circuit directly in the enclosure, the input signal is transmitted to the diaphragm without loss. As a result, even minute level signals show excellent rise and fall characteristics.<br>In addition, the back cover uses an 8-point stopper that is stronger than the conventional one to improve the damping characteristics in the middle range.<br><br><br><strong>Tweeter</strong><br>A 2.3 cm dome type tweeter using the enhanced diffusion ボロナイズドチタン DUD diaphragm is mounted in the high frequency band as well as the middle band.<br>We have also improved the start-up characteristics by adopting the DM method for the frame.<br><br><br><strong>Network</strong><br>In the network section, we pay attention to the metal-interface distortion caused by soldering, and have adopted a crimping wiring method using a oxygen-free copper sleeve.<br>The DS-1000HR also focuses on equalizing the current density to each unit. Each unit can balance the current density under the same density under the same condition, and a radial distribution plate that can directly supply power is adopted.<br><br>In order to eliminate the negative effects of electromagnetic coupling between the inductors constituting the network and leakage flux due to the voice coil driving current of each unit, we have adopted a network circuit consisting of three sections and three pieces, paying attention to the circuit configuration and element arrangement.<br>In addition, vibration analysis technology is applied to the mounting method, and the arrangement is calculated to minimize the adverse effects of the enclosure vibration and the internal pressure of the speakers. In addition, spruce with beautiful vibration damping is used for the network substrate.<br><br><br><strong>Enclosure</strong><br>The baffle plate of the enclosure is made of 30-t-thick particleboards to increase rigidity, and the back plate is made of three layers of birch plywood and particles to realize excellent attenuation characteristics and beautiful sound.<br><br>Using various computer vibration analysis technologies, we analyze sound radiation and acoustic mutual impedance caused by vibration of each unit itself and vibration of each plate surface of the enclosure. High-order modes are suppressed by the disperse resonance structure of the Diatone tradition, and low-order modes increase the rigidity of the enclosure itself as a box and achieve high-resolution reproduction by balancing the overall vibration.<br><br>A round baffle is used to prevent degradation of the sound field due to diffraction effects. In addition, the upper and lower surfaces of the baffle plate are tapered to increase the three dimensional sound field reproduction capability.<br><br><br><strong>Other</strong><br>There was a speaker stand as an option sold separately.</p>
