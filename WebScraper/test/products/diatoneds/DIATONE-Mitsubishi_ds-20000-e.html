				<p class="detail">This speaker system was developed by Diatone Kobo using various sound and woodworking technologies.<br><br>A 27 cm cone type woofer using an aramid honeycomb cone is mounted in the low range.<br>Aramid fiber is an aromatic polyamide long fiber with high strength and high elasticity as well as light weight and moderate internal loss. By using a special matrix resin, which is a special combination of aramid fiber and flexible resin, for the skin material of honeycomb cone, moderate internal loss is obtained. When bonded to the core, honeycomb structure diaphragm is made.<br>The edge uses a triaxial woven aramid fiber that exhibits uniform strength in all directions, and achieves piston motion with excellent linearity and less rolling.<br>In addition, the magnetic circuit is equipped with an A. D. M. C. -m (Advanced Magnet Circuit-music) magnetic circuit to improve response to input signals, stabilize operation against transient response, and stabilize time domain against AC magnetic flux.<br>We also pay attention to the air flow generated by the vibration of the diaphragm, and we are trying to improve the S/N in terms of audibility by examining the back surface of the diaphragm which is radiated into the cabinet in detail.<br><br>B for the middle area<sub>4</sub>Equipped with 7.5 cm dome type mid-range using C diaphragm.<br>B<sub>4</sub>C has a high specific elastic modulus second only to crystalline diamond, and also has moderate internal loss because it is a non-metal. Because this material has a high melting point of 2,450 ℃, it is molded by Diatone&#39;s unique plasma spraying method. By controlling this manufacturing method with high precision, large diameter B<sub>4</sub>The C diaphragm has been realized, and the diaphragm has a D. U. D structure integrated with voice coil bobbin to ensure excellent linearity to the input signal.<br>Both sides H. D. (High Damping) tangential edge is used for the edge part. This edge uses non-directional non-woven fabric as the center material. In addition, cotton cloth containing moderate damping material is used. It has a 5-layer structure including the adhesive layer. This reduces unnecessary radiation sound and suppresses the behavior of the diaphragm except for the direction of vibration.<br>The drive train is equipped with an A. D. M. C. -m with an alnico magnet with a diameter of 90 mm. In addition, the sub-frame that supports the diaphragm through the suspension has a larger diameter. By increasing the contact area with the magnetic circuit plate surface, the vibration damping effect due to the contact of different metals is increased. The surface of this sub-frame is coated with paint with high vibration damping capacity to thoroughly suppress unnecessary radiation. The material is also carefully examined, and after repeated trial listening, copper alloy is selected.<br><br>B for the high range<sub>4</sub>It is equipped with a 2.3 cm dome type tweeter using C diaphragm.<br>Similar to the mid-range model, this unit has a voice coil bobbin integrated D. U. D coil bobbin. In addition, the magnetic circuit uses a D. M. (direct mount) system in which a plate is directly attached to a baffle plate. The large diameter copper alloy sub-frame thoroughly suppresses unwanted resonance.<br><br>Wire materials suitable for each unit are used for the internal wiring of the network section. Crimping wiring with a gold-plated sleeve is applied to eliminate the distortion of the interface of the current. In addition, a radial power supply system is adopted to realize the appropriate current supply to each unit.<br>The layout of the network circuit is determined by repeated trial listening to the directivity of the elements (inductors and capacitors), and high sound quality is achieved as a ソフトクランブ that does not constrain the elements themselves to the network base. In addition, the network base is made of spruce wood with beautiful attenuation characteristics. In addition, the 3-piece division structure and division arrangement give consideration to electromagnetic coupling between inductors and modulation caused by sound pressure inside the enclosure.<br>In addition, consideration is given to eliminating mutual influence on the position of wiring materials from the network to the unit.<br><br>Gold plating is applied to the machined oxygen-free copper for the input terminals.<br><br>The concept of the enclosure is to finish the best wood selected from all over the world with the best woodworking technology. On top of that, Diatone vibration analysis technology has been introduced and manufactured.<br>The baffle plate and back plate are made of spruce wood, which is also used as a piano resonance plate. This spruce wood is made from Sitka spruce grown in the Sitka region of North America in a lumber core structure. In addition, in order to suppress delicate movements of wood in this lumber core structure, two layers of the front and back surfaces are bonded together, and a Black Cherry thrust plate is pasted on top of it.<br>The enclosure components are joined together with hard maple corners that are used in stringed instruments such as body plates, back plates, and faggots. In order to bring out the beautiful sound of vibration as a plate, the end surfaces of each component are not specially processed for joining and are joined together in a simple shape so that the vibration mode is not complicated.<br>The surface is finished with a polyester thick glossy coating that is applied only to top-of-the-line grand pianos for export. With this coating method, 35 steps are taken from surface treatment to final buffing. Compared with common urethane and layers, the surface is hard enough to give a sense of attack speed and improved resolution.<br><br>Gold plated sleeve for crimp wiring and gold plated oxygen-free copper for input terminals. All possible high-purity transmission technologies such as radial power supply system, 3-piece division structure and division arrangement have been introduced.<br><br>The DS 20000 is pre-aged at the factory to provide sufficient aging effects.<br>This aging used a unique signal that provides a large suspension amplitude for the low range and a noise signal close to the spectrum of the music signal for the high and high range.<br><br>Polishing wax and polishing cloth are included to maintain the gloss and maintenance of the enclosure.<br><br>There was a specially designed speaker stand that was sold separately.</p>
