				<p class="detail">This speaker system was developed as the flagship model of the ZX series for super digital audio.<br><br>A 30 cm cone type woofer is installed for low range.<br>An aramid honeycomb diaphragm is used for the vibration field. An aramid aromatic polyamide organic fiber is used for the honeycomb material with high bending rigidity and for the skin material with light weight, high strength, excellent vibration damping characteristics, and high elastic modulus. In addition, we have succeeded in molding with a large internal loss in the resin itself by specially mixing resin with the aramid fiber. This has enabled us to obtain a large thickness and sound velocity, and minimize the strain caused by the diaphragm.<br>In addition, the magnetic circuit is equipped with ADMC-m (advanced Magnet Circuit-music), and the magnetic field analysis using the finite element method reduces the influence of the magnetic field generated from the input signal and realizes low distortion.<br><br>The mid-range features a 6 cm dome mid-range.<br>B diaphragm has high specific elastic modulus next to crystalline diamond and moderate internal loss.<sub>4</sub>C (Pure Boron) is used. This material requires advanced molding techniques, but Diatone uses B plasma sprayed at a high temperature of 15,000 ℃.<sub>4</sub>C is further fired at a high temperature in an inert gas atmosphere to form a diaphragm.<br>In addition, the diaphragm structure employs DUD (Diatone Unified Diaphargm), which integrates the voice coil bobbin and diaphragm into one structure. This reduces the transmission loss of driving force, increases the high-resonance frequency, and realizes high-speed sound rise. In addition, the HD suspension realizes an honest mid-range and high resolution.<br>DM (Direct Mount) method is adopted for the magnetic circuit part. Taking advantage of the advantage of the dome type structure itself, a monocoque structure is adopted in which the magnetic circuit is framed. This realizes high rigidity and transmits the input signal to the diaphragm without loss.<br>The chamber on the back side of the unit is provided with sound absorption processing consisting of 8 layers of 6 kinds of sound absorbing materials, and absorbs the back wave of the diaphragm which causes sound bleeding.<br><br>A 2.3 cm dome-shaped tweeter is installed in the high range.<br>B for diaphragm as same as mid-range<sub>4</sub>The C-diaphragm is a DUD structure, and combined with a powerful magnetic circuit of 20,000 Gauss, it high-frequency reproduction exceeding 40,000 Hz.<br>In addition, the DM system is adopted for the magnetic circuit to realize high rigidity.<br><br>HRC (High Rigid Construction) frame is used for the frame structure of each unit.<br>In the HRC frame, the strength is improved by the thickness and shape of the frame. By holding the magnetic circuit firmly, the natural sound is reduced, and the rise and grain of sound and resolution are improved.<br><br>In addition to pursuing higher rigidity of the cabinet, the use of Siberian pine and Canadian maple for the internal reinforcement gives it a beautiful sound.<br><br>Uses a large gold plated input terminal.<br><br>There was a specially designed speaker stand sold separately.<br>This stand is made of ceramic material and has a 5-leg structure to ensure excellent rigidity and weight.</p>
