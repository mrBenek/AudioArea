				<p class="detail">This speaker system aims for more natural sound by pursuing three elements : rising sound, continuous sound, and rising and falling sound.<br><br><br><strong>Woofer</strong><br>A 30 cm cone type woofer is installed in the low range.<br><br>The diaphragm uses Diatone&#39;s unique intra-ply hybrid curved honeycomb cone.<br>This diaphragm is an extension of the honeycomb diaphragm. The front skin has high rigidity for high-speed reproduction and appropriate loss, while the back skin pursues beauty of attenuation after the signal disappears.<br>The front skin uses hybrid weaving in which aromatic polyamide aramid and PAN high strength carbon fiber are woven into an intra-ply structure. Aramid fiber is an aromatic polyamide fiber material that is lightweight and has moderate internal loss in addition to high strength and high rigidity. PAN high strength carbon fiber has an extremely high specific elastic modulus by using polyacrylonitrile as raw material. In addition, aromatic polyamide aramid is used for the back skin to improve loss factor by moderate internal loss.<br>The hybrid structure of the finished skin materials maximizes the physical characteristics of each other, and the hybrid weaving of the dust cap is also carried out thoroughly.<br>In addition, we have obtained an optimal loss factor by using a proprietary flexible resin.<br><br>Advanced DMM system is adopted for the frame part.<br>The DMM system achieves excellent start-up characteristics by fixing the entire magnetic circuit with a rigid frame. The Advanced DMM system further develops the high rigidity concept of the DMM system to improve vibration damping characteristics of the entire structure.<br>First of all, the high rigidity suppresses the magnetic circuit firmly and maintains the rigidity with respect to the fundamental wave, and for the higher mode, a new structure to disperse the higher mode has been completed by computer simulation. This suppresses the natural sound of the center pole and the natural vibration of the frame that pollutes the middle and high range, enabling clear reproduction with good S/N.<br><br><br><strong>Skorker</strong><br>The mid-range features a 6.0 cm dome mid-range.<br><br>The diaphragm uses a 60 mm reinforced diffusion ボロナイズドチタン DUD.<br>The DUD used in the structure of the diaphragm is an integrated diaphragm and voice coil bobbin. It can transmit the driving force generated in the voice coil to the diaphragm without loss. As a result, characteristics such as improved transient response, higher upper limit frequency, improved linearity and input resistance have been achieved.<br>In the DS 2000 hr, the diffusion growth of boron, which is used for the diaphragm material, is further advanced, and excellent characteristics such as high specific elastic modulus, high durability and weather resistance, and suppression of natural sound are acquired.<br><br>A DM system is used for the frame, and the magnetic circuit is mounted directly in the enclosure by a monocoque structure in which the plate part of the magnetic circuit is made into a mount plate, thus realizing further rigidity.<br><br>The DS-10000HR incorporates the technology introduced in the DS- 2000 Club.<br>First of all, in order to suppress the natural sound of the suspension part supporting the diaphragm, aromatic aramid fiber with excellent damping characteristics is used as a bias, and butyl rubber mixed with graphite slices is molded to form a 3-layer structure with laminated tangential edge.<br>In addition, the acoustic cover, to which back pressure from the diaphragm is directly applied, has been hand-made by spinning processing, and resonance mode is not concentrated in one place, but structurally dispersed.<br>In addition, the front cover has eliminated the hard steel wire mesh to reduce unwanted radiation, and instead incorporates hard steel wire and copper wire into a hybrid structure to reduce unwanted resonance.<br><br><br><strong>Tweeter</strong><br>A 2.3 cm dome type tweeter using the enhanced diffusion ボロナイズドチタン DUD diaphragm is mounted in the high frequency band as well as the middle band.<br>This unit uses a laminated tangential edge with a special coating on the edge part to suppress unwanted resonance and make the sound of the DUD diaphragm stand out.<br>We have also improved the start-up characteristics by adopting the DM method for the frame.<br><br><br><strong>Network</strong><br>In order to reduce the effects of electromagnetic interference between network circuits and vibration of the enclosure, a 3-piece separation division system is adopted for the network section. The base material is a highly damped spruce material. In addition, a floating structure with damping material is adopted to attenuate vibration from the back plate.<br><br>No soldering is used for the network wiring. At the same time, a oxygen-free copper sleeve crimping wiring is used to focus on the strain at the metallic interface. In addition, direct power is supplied to three units under the same conditions by radial power distribution.<br>All wiring materials are linear crystalline copper wires with few copper crystal interfaces, and each element and arrangement are carefully selected.<br><br><br><strong>Enclosure</strong><br>A 40-mm-thick 2-layer laminate particleboard is used for the baffle plate of the enclosure, the rigidity of the body plate and the back plate is enhanced, and a distributed resonance structure is used to suppress resonance modes by utilizing computer analysis to enhance the rigidity of the entire enclosure.<br>In addition, by carefully examining the chip structure of the particleboards themselves and carefully selecting ones with high internal loss, and by ensuring sufficient bending rigidity by using the three layer structure of the back plate with large internal pressure, damping characteristics are improved by dispersing the natural resonance of each plate, and beautiful damping is realized.<br>The exterior features a beautiful wood-grain sassafras veneer finish.<br><br>The mounting bolts of the unit are equipped with damping caps to eliminate the influence of resonance at the bolts.<br><br><br><strong>Other</strong><br>As an option sold separately, there was a speaker stand DK 2000 designed exclusively for DS 2000 hr.<br>The DK 2000 uses the same high-density particleboards as the enclosure for the legs and a hybrid structure consisting of graphite cast iron and particleboards for the bottom.<br>In addition, we focused on standing waves generated between the speaker bottom plate and the stand bottom and between the two legs. The stand bottom is rounded and the legs are arranged non-parallel.</p>
