				<p class="detail">A floor-type speaker system that uses a staggered multi-drive system.<br><br><strong>Woofer</strong><br>Two 22 cm cone type woofers are installed in the low range.<br><br>New Aramid Hybrid Honeycomb diaphragm is used for the diaphragm.<br>The front skin of this diaphragm is made of organic fiber aramid with high strength and moderate internal loss, and aramid hybrid FRP with intra-ply structure of inorganic fiber amorphous silica with 15% higher rigidity than conventional ones. The back skin is made of cellulose skin with excellent internal loss. By making these two skins into a honeycomb structure, high rigidity and internal loss are combined in a high dimension.<br>Furthermore, the adoption of a high-rigidity R. S. frame suppresses unwanted resonance.<br><br>ADMC (Advanced Magnet Circuit) is used for the magnetic circuit.<br>In this system, the magnetic distortion generated in the drive system is thoroughly analyzed using the finite element method and effectively suppressed. First of all, the center pole shape has been fundamentally revised in order to increase the symmetry of the DC component of the magnetic flux that crosses the voice coil and the distribution of the AC magnetic flux. In addition, the AC magnetic flux from the voice coil is AC magnetic flux from the voice coil and suppresses the magnetic distortion caused by the superposition of the DC magnetic flux and the AC magnetic flux. In addition, the disturbance of the DC magnetic flux due to the AC magnetic flux in the magnetic circuit is also reduced.<br><br><br><strong>Mid-range</strong><br>Mid-range with 5 cm dome mid-range.<br><br>Boron DUD is used for the diaphragm.<br>Boron has excellent properties such as high specific elasticity, high durability and weather resistance, and suppression of natural noise. The DUD system has a high-rigidity diaphragm structure in which a diaphragm and a voice coil bobbin are integrated, and the driving force generated in the voice coil is transmitted to the diaphragm without loss, thereby improving response to input signals.<br><br>A laminated tangential edge is used for the support part.<br>This edge has a hybrid structure made of butyl rubber with aramid fiber excellent in damping characteristics, and has excellent linearity and suppresses the natural sound of the suspension itself.<br><br>The frame uses the DM method, and the mounting plate of the magnetic circuit is integrated with the frame, and the magnetic circuit is mounted directly in the enclosure for higher rigidity.<br>In addition, the frame is made of a brass material with a high anti-vibration effect to achieve even greater rigidity.<br><br><br><strong>Tweeter</strong><br>A 2.3 cm dome-shaped tweeter is installed in the high range.<br><br><br><strong>Network</strong><br>Each of the two woofers has a dedicated network circuit for the mid-range and low-range channels, and a dedicated network circuit for the low-range channel. This ensures a smooth connection with the mid-range channel and enhances fundamental bandwidth.<br><br>Independent power supply system is adopted to eliminate interference between each unit and network.<br>In addition, crimping wiring with a oxygen-free copper sleeve is adopted to prevent the metallic interface distortion of the current.<br><br><strong>Enclosure</strong><br>The enclosure uses a bass reflex system.<br><br>The enclosure is made of 40-mm-thick double-layered laminated particleboards for higher rigidity. It is also a dispersion resonance type that suppresses resonance modes by utilizing measurement and analysis technology such as vibration analysis of the enclosure.<br>In addition, a rear bass reflex system with a capacity of approximately 60 liters is employed to achieve richer low-frequency playback.<br><br>The base is made of a solid material with a thickness of 50 mm, and the enclosure receives points to minimize the effect of installation conditions.</p>
