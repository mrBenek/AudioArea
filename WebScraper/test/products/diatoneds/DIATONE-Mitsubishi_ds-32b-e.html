				<p class="detail">This bookshelf speaker system offers a wide range and a wide dynamic range.<br><br>A 25 cm cone type woofer is installed in the low range.<br>This unit uses a low-distortion magnetic circuit equipped with an FN ring, which is also used in the DS-35BmkII, etc., to greatly reduce the distortion of the magnetic circuit. In addition, by installing a 120 mm diameter magnet in the magnetic circuit, the amplitude distortion is suppressed and a damped low sound is obtained.<br>In addition, in order to realize the slow low sound reproduction characteristic of the bass reflex system, the press pressure of the cone paper is relatively low and close to non-press. The voice coil is equipped with a damping ring made of special synthetic rubber, which increases internal loss and reduces noise turbidity caused by unwanted sound.<br>Die-cast frame is used for the frame.<br><br>The mid-range is equipped with a 10 cm cone type squaker.<br>The diaphragm of this unit is designed to conform to a catenary curve and to a matched resonance type by arranging corrugation. In addition, the dry press method is adopted to obtain the appropriate hardness and internal loss, and each fiber is connected together without being damaged in an unforced state.<br>The edge has a V-shaped edge that has excellent linearity with a small amplitude within the practical range and is strong against lateral vibration. In addition, the material is a Cross Edge made of thick fiber. It is subjected to a damping treatment to realize bright and extended middle and high frequency reproduction.<br><br>A 4-cm cone type tweeter is installed in the high range.<br>In addition to the small aperture of 4 cm in order to improve the directional characteristics, the center cap is made of titanium with excellent rigidity to suppress the generation of split vibration. As a result, almost flat characteristics are obtained up to 30 khz frequency band.<br>The damper is mechanically braked with special synthetic rubber, and combined with electromagnetic braking by a powerful magnetic circuit to achieve high temperature with effective damping.<br>Aluminum die-cast is used for the frame.<br><br>The network section is designed to be low distortion and is designed by repeating physical and hearing tests.<br>The parts include a core coil with low transmission loss and a metallized polyester film capacitor with low distortion.<br><br>Equipped with level controls for the middle and high frequencies, each of which can be switched in four stages.<br><br>The front baffle has a symmetrical unit layout with the squaker and tweeter positioned slightly inward from the center line of the baffle plate to improve sound image localization.<br><br>The enclosure has a large depth and an internal volume of 45 liters. It uses a bass-reflex system with a wooden duct. It uses a 210 mm long wooden duct made of strong 15 mm wood to eliminate resonance to eliminate resonance and suppress distortion down to low frequencies below 100 Hz. In addition, a twin triangle duct with rectangular ports divided diagonally is used to suppress standing waves.<br>In addition, the internal structure is a dispersion resonance type with a strong joint structure and special dispersion type reinforcement materials. By dispersing the resonance mode, vibration of the enclosure itself is suppressed and box rumbling phenomenon is prevented. Board material is 15 mm thick (front baffle is 20 mm thick) particleboards are used.<br><br>The exterior is finished with a walnut pattern.</p>
