				<p class="detail">A D/A converter compatible with 3 sampling frequencies released simultaneously with the DP-81L.<br><br>The D/A converter uses the world&#39;s first 20-bit discrete method for consumer use.<br>The operating precision is different from the usual way of adding bits above or below 16 bits, and the precision of each bit is 1/2 of the original.<SUP>20</SUP>=9.54x10<SUP>-7</SUP>As a result, an excellent performance of 0.0005% actual distortion factor (pure distortion component only, 1 kHz) has been realized. In addition, quantization noise, which interferes with high-quality sound reproduction, is greatly reduced.<br>The conversion method is a current addition type which is superior in linearity. It is a discrete method to realize the performance of the 20-bit theoretical limit value. Therefore, the circuit is composed of current switching elements and ultra-precision resistors. Each unit is strictly adjusted to realize the complete operation, and the strain (0 cross strain) at small output is removed.<br><br>The digital filter uses an independent 20-bit 8 x oversampling digital filter on the left and right sides.<br>The DC-81L filter uses digital calculation techniques to achieve an attenuation of -110dB between 24.1 and 328.7 kHz and a passband ripple within ± 0.00005%, which can degrade sound quality.<br><br>An audio low-pass filter that cuts out unwanted bands uses a highly selected discrete GIC third order Butterworth active filter.<br><br>As a measure against high-frequency noise, the digital filter and D/A converter are electrically isolated by an opto-coupler.<br>Each bit signal output from the digital filter is optically transmitted through an opto-coupler (transmission band 7Mbit/sec) and converted back into an electrical signal, ensuring complete electrical isolation and preventing noise interference through the conductor.<br>The output of the opto-coupler is fed to a magnetically and electrically isolated analog converter through a mother printed board outside the shield frame.<br><br>Three sampling frequencies of 48 kHz, 44.1 kHz and 32 kHz are available.<br>Switching is performed by automatically determining the frequency of the input signal. Since each of the three frequencies is equipped with a dedicated oscillator, out-of-band noise is reduced and jitter is prevented.<br><br>The input terminals are equipped with a total Route 3 of a Route 3 for optical fiber and a Route 6 for coaxial cable.<br><br>A noise shaper is installed to further reduce quantization noise.<br>The noise shaper reduces noise within the audible band by using a technique that reduces noise by feeding back the rounding error generated by the digital filter to the next data.<br><br>Equipped with digital de-emphasis, it is possible to play high-quality CDs with emphasis applied.<br>The DC-81L achieves a deviation of ± 0.001 dB and a phase difference of less than 1.5 degrees with respect to the specified characteristics.<br><br>The output of the converter is set to a level that does not require amplification, and the S/N and distortion characteristics are improved by only buffering in the audio stage.<br>The circuit configuration of the audio stage is a discrete configuration push-pull DC servo connection system.<br><br>Equipped with digital level control.<br>The Remote Commander included with the DP-80L allows volume control from a remote location and was sold separately.<br><br>Two RCA-type output terminals and one XLR-type balanced output terminal are installed.<br><br>The digital and analog circuits are shielded with metal and each power supply is provided with a dedicated transformer to eliminate mutual interference. The left and right circuits are laid out on an independent printed board to prevent interference between channels together with a two winding transformer on the left and right.<br><br>Measures against unwanted external radiation are taken, and leakage through the power supply is dealt with by a full-scale line filter.<br>It is also shielded inside.<br><br>The exterior is gold-style scratch hairline finish, and the side is equipped with a natural Persimmon sideboard.</p>
