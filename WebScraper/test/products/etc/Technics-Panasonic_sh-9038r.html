				<p class="detail">This is a quartz synthesizer FM reception controller with a function to provide data for selecting the optimum direction of FM antenna and data for judging the broadcast radio wave grade and preparing countermeasures.<br><br>In combination with the ST 9038 t, it is designed to provide the best reception performance under given conditions.<br><br>Equipped with an electric field strength display, it digitally displays the electric field strength in 2 db steps from 20 db (10 μ V) to 110 db (316 mv).<br><br>Equipped with a multipath level display, the level of multiple reflections (multipath) caused by the reflection of broadcast radio waves from mountains and buildings is digitally displayed in 1 dB steps taken from the middle of the IF stage.<br><br>It is equipped with an automatic antenna rotation mechanism with memory, and by using the included antenna rotator, the antenna can be freely rotated in either right or left direction by operating the front panel switch.<br>In this case, the deviation of the antenna direction from the reference direction set arbitrarily is digitally displayed in 2 ° steps from 0 ° to 358 °.<br>In addition, the optimum direction of the antenna can be determined by measuring both the electric field strength and multipath level of the received radio wave, and up to eight stations can be stored in memory. When this memory is completed, when the station is received, the display is set to the antenna direction, the rotator switch is set to auto, and the antenna automatically rotates in that direction just by pressing the tuning button.<br><br>Since the SH-9038R is equipped with a quartz synthesizer, it can be combined with the ST-9038T to form a double quartz synthesizer and achieve extremely high reception performance.<br>As a result, four reception modes can be selected by the RF line selector of the SH-9038R.<br><br>When the RF line selector is set to the booster function that demonstrates its power in weak electric fields, an RF amplifier with a gain of 30 dB is inserted. When combined with the ST-9038T, the practical sensitivity is realized -4dB (0.6 μ V) at 75 Ω line, and an RF stage equivalent to 7 series in a varicon is formed.<br><br>When an RF line selector is set to the repeater function which improves the interference rejection capability, the repeater function of SH-9038R and ST-9038T are combined to become a tuner equivalent to a 14 series varicon, and IM interference rejection characteristics of 90 dB or more at ± 400 kHz can be obtained.<br><br>An attenuator that can attenuate the input by 30 dB in a strong electric field can be inserted, and a through position that can pass through SH-9038R is also installed.<br><br>If the tuning selector is set to int, the conventional manual tuning by the flywheel is possible.<br>The half-turn can continuously feed up and down at 100 khz.<br><br>It uses a diecasting cabinet with good shielding effect similar to the ST-9038T.<br><br>Connection with ST-9038T and microcomputer programmable unit SH-9038R can be done with one touch via 16 pin bus line.</p>
