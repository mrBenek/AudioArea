				<p class="detail">This is a universal tone arm that inherits FR-24 technology and has a wide range of adaptability.<br><br>A miniature bearing with high precision is used for the rotation support mechanism. In addition, the weight of the movable part of the arm is small, and the inertia efficiency is small, and high performance is obtained, and stable tracking is realized.<br><br>An aluminum light alloy pipe with a large outer diameter is used for the arm support part in the vertical rotation direction to absorb resonance.<br>It also helps to improve machining accuracy of the rotation support mechanism.<br><br>An aluminum alloy pipe with an outer diameter of 8 mm is used for the arm part to suppress resonance and reduce the mass of the entire arm to enable light needle pressure operation.<br>The cartridge mounting shell is made of pressed aluminum alloy with a thickness of 1 mm.<br><br>The rotation support part prevents resonance by using a resonance prevention device that absorbs reverse resonance caused by needle pressure weight and balance weight, and a side balancer for needle pressure with built-in damping material.<br><br>In addition to adjusting the lateral balance, it is equipped with a side balancer equipped with a needle pressure application device that can accurately set the needle pressure weight within the range of 0 ~ 5g.<br>In the past, the lateral balancer and needle pressure application weight were separated individually, but in the FR-34, these two adjustments can be performed simultaneously, realizing a significant reduction in weight.<br><br>The needle pressure adjustment can be read directly from 0 to 5 grams in 0.5g steps. Precise adjustment is possible without a needle pressure system. In addition, the needle pressure weight adopts a new mechanism that clicks and stops at every scale.<br><br>It is equipped with a slide base, and when foreign heads such as Orthophone or heads of domestic manufacturers are attached to FR-34, the needle tip position of each different cartridge can be corrected with a knob.<br>This base is also useful against vibration from the floor and prevents the S / N ratio and dynamic range from decreasing.<br><br>The head shell part is common with FR-24, and it is a European standard 4-terminal type.<br><br>The lead wire at the base of the arm is a 5-terminal type unique to FR and does not require soldering.<br><br>The tip of the leader has a standard molded plug that fits into a common pin plug.<br><br>By changing the adjustment range of the scale to full scale 0 ~ 2.5g, the weight for light needle pressure which can determine the needle pressure more accurately was sold separately.</p>
