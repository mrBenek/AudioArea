				<p class="detail">D/A converter incorporating the high-end technology used in the D-3.<br><br>It is equipped with 4 types and 8 systems of input terminals for a wide range of inputs. In addition, the BNC terminals are also compatible with RCA-pin terminals by the included BNC-RCA Adapter plug.<br>In addition, in order to maintain the digital quality of the input, a balanced transmission method is adopted for all signal paths, and a high-performance berry high-speed C-MOS balanced type is installed in the selector section.<br><br>A new DSRLL is installed to reduce jitters in the transmission path.<br>In the DSRLL mounted on the D-3, the input digital signal is resampled and replaced with a quartz clock to reduce jitters to 1 / 100. Moreover, high-quality specifications that are effective at frequencies of 3 Hz or higher have been realized.<br>The circuit mounted on the D-30 is a refinement of this, and achieves higher performance by reducing jitter in the almost entire audible band of 0.5 Hz or more by more than 1 / 100 and eliminating it with a second order (12dB/oct) cutoff characteristic compared to the conventional first order. In addition, the resampling frequency can be selected from 44.1 kHz and 48 kHz, expanding the possibilities in sound quality and functions.<br><br>Equipped with a newly developed high-precision PLL mode that synchronizes with the second PLL of the D-30 while maintaining the sampling frequency of the input digital signal.<br>The second PLL employs a new mathematical digital phase detector and digital loop filter that control the lithium rate VCO very precisely. By eliminating the dead band of the phase detector, which had been a concern for a long time, we have succeeded in eliminating phase distortion. This eliminates jitters of 30 Hz or higher with the second cutoff characteristic even in the PLL mode where the DSRLL is not operated, greatly improving the quality of phase control.<br><br>Equipped with WORD SYNC mode.<br>This mode is for external synchronization and allows synchronous operation with a digital device with a WORD clock input terminal. With a separate CD, the transport and D/A converter are controlled by separate clocks. However, with a terminal that outputs the WORD clock, it is possible to synchronize the two devices by the D-30 system clock.<br><br>Equipped with BOTH mode.<br>WORD SYNC mode is advantageous in that it can be controlled by a single system clock, but there is a possibility of increased jittering during transmission such as clock sending. In the BOTH mode of the D-30, DSRLL is also used in WORD SYNC mode, enabling better clock control.<br><br>By sampling digital data with a crystal oscillator, we have succeeded in clock isolating not only the audio signal but also the subcode signal, thereby eliminating the possibility that non-audio data such as subcode and jitter would enter the audio circuit and modulate the audio signal.<br><br>The digital circuit is equipped with a FIR-type digital filter and a sine wave moving average circuit. By over-sampling 12/24 times, the load on the analog filter in the latter stage is reduced, enabling more accurate music playback.<br>The D/A converter uses a symmetrical 20-bit 8-DAC configuration, and the dither subtraction uses a symmetrical resistance addition method with a simple two stage configuration consisting of an I-V amplifier and a buffer amplifier to minimize modulation errors.<br><br>Equipped with addition dither switching mechanism.<br>In order to improve the step accuracy of D/A conversion to theoretical values, the Eso Telic has adopted an ZD circuit that adds and subtracts dither from the first D-1. This circuit has since been refined into a noise shaper ZDII. The dither addition amount for D-2 and D-3 is NS14 (noise shaping : 14-bit high frequency concentrated type).<br>In the D-30, the addition amount of this dither can be switched between NS14-bit, NS16-bit and F-specific flat FLAT14-bit. By changing the place where step error is averaged, various sound qualities can be selected.<br><br>Equipped with a digital filter&#39;s high-band characteristic switching mechanism.<br>NARROW, which sharply cuts frequencies above 20 kHz, and WIDE, which gently cuts frequencies above 20 kHz, can be selected. In addition to B-mode, which is the same as D-3, WIDE is equipped with A-mode, which relaxes the strain contained in the source, and can be selected according to the characteristics and preference of the room and source.<br><br>It has a 7-box structure consisting of DAC, DAIR, analog power supply, digital power supply, digital out, AC input, and power transformer. It also has a 1.6 mm thick copper-plated high-shielding chassis with sufficient space for optimum layout of signals and power wiring.<br>Two front and one rear pin-point legs made of high carbon cast iron and pedestal define the mechanical earth point.<br><br>Equipped with Digital Out.<br>The D-30, the D-30 is equipped with a selector that can turn the Digital Out and Analog Out on / off independently to prevent interference when used only for the D/A converter or digital selector.<br><br>2-cut core large power transformer, high frequency relay with electromagnetic shield, Berry High-Speed C-MOS, and high-quality parts such as SMB high-frequency cable are adopted.<br><br>Equipped with a high-precision digital attenuator of + 6dB/-42dB.<br><br>You can switch between stereo and monaural.<br><br>The absolute phase can be switched.<br><br>It is equipped with soft muting function and backup memory function.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
