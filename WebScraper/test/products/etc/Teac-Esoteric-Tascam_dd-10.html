				<p class="detail">A D/D converter that can be used not only as a high-quality digital selector, but also as a digital preamplifier such as a sampling rate converter or digital gain control.<br><br><br>There are four types and eight systems for input terminals : BNC Route 3, XLR1 system, TOS Route 3 and ST1 system.<br>In addition, in order to maintain the digital quality of the input signal, a balanced transmission method is adopted for all signal paths, and a Berry High-Speed C-MOS balanced type is mounted on the selector.<br>The BNC terminals are compatible with RCA-pin terminals according to the supplied adapter plug.<br><br><br>Digital signals are subject to time-axis distortion called jitter due to various factors that occur within the digital equipment, inherent to the source, or during transmission.<br>Jitter is a variation in the spacing of the pulse train of the digital signal. If jitter increases, the accuracy of the quantization step decreases and the reproduced waveform differs from the original waveform.<br>The DD-10 uses a DSRLL circuit to resample the input digital signal and replaces it with a quartz precision clock to achieve higher performance by eliminating jitters over the entire audible range (0.5 Hz to 45 kHz) with more than 1 / 100 and eliminating second order (12dB/oct) cutoff characteristics compared to the conventional first order.<br>Two resampling frequencies, 44.1 kHz and 48 kHz, can be selected.<br><br>The newly developed PLL mode is mounted in addition to the DSRLL mode.<br>In this mode, the second PLL of the DD-10 synchronizes the sampling frequency of the input digital signal with the sampling frequency. In the second PLL, a new mathematical digital phase detector digital loop filter that controls the lithium tantalate VCO very accurately eliminates the dead band of the phase detector, which has been a concern for a long time, and eliminates intermodulation distortion.<br>Even in the PLL mode, jitter of 30 Hz or higher is eliminated by the secondary cutoff characteristic (12dB/oct), greatly improving the quality of phase control.<br><br><br>It has a digital PLL that clock isolates non-audio data.<br>By sampling communication digital data with a crystal oscillator, we succeeded in clock isolating not only audio signals but also subcode signals.<br>For the first time in the world, it is equipped with an epoch-making time control circuit that eliminates the possibility that non-audio data such as subcodes enters the audio circuit and thereby modulates the audio signal.<br><br><br>Equipped with a high band selection switch, the cut-off characteristics of the digital filter can be changed.<br>This function allows you to select two modes : Wide with slow and low attenuation characteristics and Narrow with steep and high attenuation characteristics. This function operates only in DSRLL mode.<br>The DSRLL circuit circuit operates output signal from the input signal because of the asynchronous input / output operation. The interpolation operation used here is a combination of a 64 x oversampling filter and a 1/128 x decimation filter. A digital filter, which is not required in a normal synchronous circuit (PLL), is added. Two modes can be controlled by adjusting the coefficient and the number of taps of the output operation filter.<br><br><br>It is equipped with an inbound noise shaping switching mechanism as an output bit number switching function.<br>This feature uses quantization noise at the highest frequency in the band to improve resolution at relatively low frequencies, so that 20-bit information can be sent to DAT, DAC, CD-R, MD, etc. with a low number of effective bits (16 bits / 18 bits) without being truncated.<br><br><br>Equipped with input polarity (operating polarity) switching function.<br>This function switches the input operation polarity of the first stage PLL. Normally, DAIF (Digital Audio Interface Format) can communicate correct information regardless of the polarity of biphase mark modulated data. However, the difference in transition time between 0 and 1 or between 1 and 0 of the digital signal affects the incidence of jitter, so the overall jitter characteristics can be affected by the input operation polarity.<br>This function stabilizes the jitter characteristic by switching the operation polarity.<br><br>The operation status of the input polarity switching function can be confirmed by the color of the LED on the front panel.<br>This LED can be switched depending on the ON/OFF operation of the Polarity key and the operation status of the Polar and Scramble keys of the remote controller.<br>Scramble effectively reduces the total jitter of the receiver by operating a scramble circuit for output data in ST communication. It operates only when a device equipped with the descramble function is connected.<br><br><br>Equipped with an output level key, the level of the digital output can be adjusted from -42dB to + 6.0 dB with a high-precision digital attenuator.<br>The digital output can be soft muted by the built-in muting key.<br><br><br>The internal structure is a 7-box structure including DAIR, power supply, digital out, AC input, and power transformer.<br>In pursuit of optimum layout, it is designed as a 1.6 mm thick copper plated high shielding chassis with sufficient space.<br>In addition, the mechanical earth point is clarified by pinpoint legs and bases made of high carbon cast iron at 2 points in front and 1 point in rear.<br><br>Uses a large 2-cut core power transformer.<br>It also fully adopts Very High Speed C-MOS and uses SMB high-frequency cables.<br><br>Equipped with a backup memory function, it is retained for one week after the power is turned off.<br>The input number, output level setting, polarity switching and digital output ON/OFF are retained.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
