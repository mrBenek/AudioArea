				<p class="detail">The top-of-the-line quartz synthesizer DD turntable was completed by making full use of all player technologies possessed by Technics.<br><br>It uses an ultra-low speed electronic commutator brushless DC motor developed based on the motor of the Technics SP-02 cutting race drive unit with the world&#39;s leading torque. It realizes the enormous starting torque of 16 kg ・ cm, which is the largest of Technics for consumer equipment.<br>This value is 2.5 times larger than that of SP-10mk2, and allows a 10 kg ultra-heavy turntable to rotate for 0.25 seconds at a constant rotation angle of 30 °.<br><br>The stop mechanism uses both a mechanical brake and an electronic brake that instantaneously activates the reverse rotation drive circuit. This makes it possible to stop a 10 kg ultra-heavy turntable in 0.3 seconds. In addition, by using both the mechanical brake and the electronic brake, there is almost no shock sound even when the turntable is instantaneously stopped.<br>At the time of speed change, a huge starting torque is used from low speed to high speed, and an electronic brake drive circuit is operated from high speed to low speed, enabling instantaneous switching.<br>In addition, the mechanical brake is maintained in a half-brake state while the machine is stopped to prevent unnecessary movement of the turntable, enabling the needle tip to be protected and precise head-out during recording performance.<br><br>The SP-10mk3 uses top-of-the-line components. In particular, the turntable has a two layer structure consisting of an aluminum die-cast turntable and a 15 mm thick copper alloy turntable. It weighs 10 kg and weighs 1.1 ton-cm.<sup>2</sup>For example, when tracing the outer circumference of a 30 cm record with a 2g needle pressure, the braking torque is equivalent to approximately 10g ・ cm. Therefore, with a 2g needle pressure, a rotational speed deviation of 0% is possible even when playing with 100 arms simultaneously.<br><br>In order to improve rotational performance, we have adopted a unique integrated structure DD in which the rotor magnet of the motor is integrated with the turntable. Therefore, there is no need to stack the case, motor and turntable, and the structure has high accuracy. In addition, the turntable also has a large inertial mass, and stable rotational characteristics are obtained.<br>In addition to this mechanical accuracy, a unique all-around detection FG is used to detect the number of revolutions. Unlike the one point detection method, the detection coil is distributed around the entire circumference of the rotor so that an extremely high-precision FG detection signal can be obtained.<br>The phase control circuit detects the phase difference between the detected FG signal and the reference signal and controls the rotation in the positive direction. A quartz oscillator is used to generate the reference signal in this case.<br>As a result, outstanding rotational performance of 0.015% wow and flutter, and accuracy of within ± 0.001% rotational speed deviation, which exceeds human detection eyes, are realized.<br><br>The cabinet is made of high-precision zinc die-cast and aluminum die-cast, and the bottom base is made of TNRC, a unique acoustic material with excellent new rod characteristics. These measures emphasize the traditional concept of no vibration and no resonance and realize an excellent SN ratio.<br><br>It achieves extremely precise rotation by quartz control and also employs a quartz synthesizer system that enables pitch control. This allows adjustment over a wide range of constant speed rotation up to ± 9.9% with a variation of 0.1% below the human eye. The adjustment can be performed in 199 ways at 33 1/3, 45, and 78.26 rpm, for a total of 597 quartz lock pitches.<br>The pitch adjustment button is installed in the attached control unit and allows fine adjustment in increments of 0.1% with one push. Also, when the pitch is variable, pressing the clear button instantly restores the pitch to 0%.<br>In addition, if you press the pitch lock button at any number of revolutions, the number of revolutions is locked and the word &quot;pitch lock&quot; lights up. In this state, the number of revolutions does not change even if you press any other button.<br>When the flash is rotating at constant speed, it appears to stop in yellow-green, but when the pitch is variable, it appears to move in red-orange.<br><br>The control unit can be used to turn the power on/off, start / stop the turntable, set the rotational speed, and control the pitch.<br>Rotation speed and pitch adjustment amount Highly visible LED is used for the display, and together with the smoked acrylic panel cover, it enables clear digital display.<br><br>Turntable start / stop and rotation number switching switches are also provided on the body.<br><br>* About cabinet<br>When the supplied screws are used, the cabinet thickness of the mounting screws is 40 to 55m. In other cases, screws corresponding to the cabinet thickness are required. The screws are metric screws with nominal diameter 5 and pitch 0.8.<br>In addition, we recommend that the cabinet be made of sufficiently thick and heavy material in order to demonstrate its performance.</p>
