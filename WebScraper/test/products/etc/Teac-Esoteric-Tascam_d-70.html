				<p class="detail">D/A converter that supports a wide range of input sampling frequencies from 32 kHz to 192 kHz.<br><br>Input sampling frequency of 32 kHz to 192 kHz and 24 bit input are supported.<br>When 176.4 kHz or 192 kHz is used, two XLR inputs are used simultaneously to ensure stable transmission.<br><br>It is equipped with a function that can upconvert up to 24bit/768kHz by 2 kinds of algorithms.<br>The digital filter section offers two selectable algorithms : FIR for HDCD and RDOT (Refined Digital Output Technology).<br>It is also possible to customize the setting to the user&#39;s preference by combining up to 16 times the oversampling order of the two connected series. For example, it is possible to sharply roll off out-of-band noise with FIR, and then reproduce the band exceeding fs/2 with RDOT. This is an algorithm that realizes the natural sound characteristic of RDOT without any aliasing noise.<br><br>RDOT supports 24 bit / 44.1 kHz input instead of 16 bit / 192 kHz input, and the maximum oversampling order has been increased from 8 times to 16 times.<br>RDOT is an analog-and-complementary technology based on the full entropy theory to reproduce sounds at 20 kHz or higher. The new RDOT used in the D-70 is not only for CDs at 44.1 kHz, but also for CDs at all sampling frequencies up to 192 kHz. As a result, the new RDOT generates data in excess of fs/2 by analog-and-generate music information that may have existed between the data. The new RDOT realizes more natural sound quality and reproducibility of sound field by making it possible to feel natural sound and differences in resolution and reverberation when instruments are overlapped.<br>In addition to the new RDOT, a configuration of FIR DF + RDOT + newly developed AML circuit + high-precision 24bit4DAC realizes excellent information content.<br><br>It is equipped with RAM Link (Refined Asynchronous Memory Link) which is a new circuit method unique to Eso Telic.<br>In this method, a 128 Mbit SDRAM is placed in the front stage of the DAC to improve the synchronization accuracy and realize an ideal jitterless D/A conversion. This circuit theoretically eliminates all jitter regardless of the input jitter or the frequency band, and achieves high-end specifications with a calculation error of 0.<br>This circuit is equipped with a large-capacity RAM, which completely absorbs the jitter generated in the transmission line. By reading the data in the RAM with an internal high-precision clock, high-purity jitter-less data is sent to the DAC at the later stage. In addition, the large-capacity RAM is compatible with high-bit high-pulling, and long-time continuous playback is realized without fine adjustment of the clock frequency according to the remaining capacity of the RAM. In addition, the large-capacity RAM is capable of accepting large-capacity audio data increased by over-sampling or differential data.<br><br>Equipped with a servo-less direct clocking system.<br>In general, if an independent D/A clock is to be used in addition to the clock of the digital audio input signal, it is necessary to finely adjust the D/A clock frequency with a PLL or other device in order to synchronize the two clocks. Therefore, in high-end equipment, there was a proposition in circuit design that how to realize this frequency adjustment without losing sound quality.<br>In the D-70, the clock control and adjustment circuit itself is completely eliminated, and the DAC is locked by oscillating the crystal of the audio frequency directly at a fixed frequency. This means that D/A can be completely asynchronously with the transmission frequency. Input jitter is not transmitted at all. In addition, the concern about the failure caused by the complete asynchronous operation is solved by increasing the RAM capacity (128 Mbit).<br><br>Word Sync output is installed.<br>By connecting the internal clock of the DAC to the transport corresponding to the word sync, the clock is perfectly synchronized so that the jitter at the time of transmission can be ignored.<br><br>The D/A conversion section uses four PCM1704 multi-bit DACs manufactured by Bar Brown Co., Ltd. for a differential configuration.<br>In addition, the digital data read from the RAM is isolated electrically once when it is sent to the subsequent stage. This prevents disturbance from entering the signal line and ground potential of the analog stage and realizes purer D/A conversion.<br><br>The power supply is equipped with dedicated transformers for digital and analog circuits respectively to eliminate interference between circuits.<br>In order to supply the optimum power supply voltage to each stage, each stage has its own regulator circuit to form a clean power supply circuit.<br><br>Equipped with 7 digital inputs of 3 types (XLR/RCA/TOS).<br>In addition, two types of analog outputs (XLR/RCA) and two TOS digital outputs are installed.<br><br>Equipped with digital volume.<br>Since the output level of the volume can be varied from 0 to -60dB or - ∞, it can be directly connected to a power amplifier. The minimum step width is 0.1 dB.<br><br>Mass 8 kg solid steel 8 mm thick base board is adopted, and vibration and resonance from the outside are completely eliminated.<br>In addition, pin-point foot &amp; base made of high carbon cast iron is adopted at 2 places on the front side and 1 place on the rear side of the leg part, and the mechanical earth point is clarified.<br><br>It uses 7 Blocks Isolated Body Construction for internal construction.<br>A 7-block structure consisting of a digital board, an analog board, a digital power board, an analog power board, an AC primary board, a word clock board, and a transformer section enhances the strength while achieving an electrical isolating effect.<br>In addition, the chassis is a two layer plated chassis with nickel plated on 1.6 mm thick copper plated steel sheet.<br>In general copper plated chassis, an oxide film is formed on the surface and the contact resistance becomes high, making it difficult to achieve the same potential and low noise. In order to improve the earth potential and electromagnetic shield of the D-70, a thick chassis with two layer plating is used for all the chassis to realize the low impedance of the entire case.<br><br>A space was provided on the rear panel so that the IEEE1394 terminal can be upgraded.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.<br><br>The D-70 had a version upgrade service from 2003 to 2005.<br>In this version upgrade service, the precision of the internal clock is improved, and a high-precision crystal oscillator (within ± 3 ppm, more than 10 times the conventional one) is installed, and D/A conversion with higher precision can be performed.<br>In addition to the conventional wordclock (sync signal) output function, a wordclock input function has been added to enable word-sync operation using an external master clock generator. This makes it possible to upgrade the entire system by combining a high-precision external master clock generator.<br>In addition to the conventional 88.2/96kHz, this upgraded version has been upgraded to 176.4/192kHz word clock input / output in order to cope with high sampling of digital devices.<br>Carefully selected high-quality parts were used for the parts. In addition, the initial model for the D-70 user has been changed from the separate footstand type pinpoint legs to the integrated footstand type pinpoint legs for reliable installation. The footstand is unsteady, but when installed, it becomes pinpoint support and disperses vibration effectively. In addition, felt attached to the back of the footstand to prevent damage to the floor.</p>
