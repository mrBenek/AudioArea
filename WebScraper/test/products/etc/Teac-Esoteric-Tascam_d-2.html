				<p class="detail">D/A converter equipped with newly developed distortion shaper ZD-II.<br><br>It is equipped with ZD-II which is an improved version of ZD circuit using dither method.<br>The ZD-II achieves a high S/N ratio by driving the dither signal out of the audible band by using a high-frequency-concentrated (high-pass) dither. It also improves the distortion shaping effect by dispersing the conversion error of the D/A converter and realizing a significantly low distortion factor.<br>By flattening the D/A conversion step over the entire band of 18 bits (262,144 steps), reproducibility at a very small level, overtone components in a large volume signal, and reproducibility of subtle hole tones are enhanced.<br><br>Perfect balance transmission for both digital transmission and analog transmission prevents noise from entering the ground line.<br>In this fully balanced transmission, in addition to the normal positive-phase signal, a negative-phase signal is transmitted simultaneously. Digital noise flowing into the ground through stray capacitors (stray capacitance) is canceled by taking advantage of the fact that it becomes negative-phase, thereby ensuring pure ground potential.<br><br>In order to perform accurate D/A conversion, a lithium tantalate VCO with very low VCO noise is used in the PLL circuit, and a newly developed jitter cancellation circuit with high carrier purity is incorporated in order to accurately transmit the time axis obtained from the PLL circuit to the D/A converter.<br><br>In order to respond to various digital inputs such as CD, DAT and BS broadcasting, it is equipped with an automatic search mechanism to realize a high precision wide lock range.<br><br>The digital filter uses a 45-bit 8 x oversampling digital filter.<br>In addition, it is equipped with a newly developed noise shaper to convert accurately calculated 45-bit gray-scale information into 18-bit information, and achieves resolution below the noise level without truncating ultramicro signals of 18-bit or less.<br><br>For analog circuits, we use carefully selected MOS-FETs with very little odd order harmonic distortion, which is easier to hear than ordinary transistors.<br><br>Uses 4BOX2 chassis to eliminate mechanical and electrical interference.<br>In this structure, the digital, analog, power supply, and power transformer sections are each housed in one box, and are independently laid out in a highly rigid inner chassis. In addition, external vibration and internal resonance are completely eliminated by fixing it to a front panel with 18 mm thick section and a rigid body.<br>In addition, stability is improved by using a low center of gravity structure in which heavy parts are laid out in the lower part of the body.<br><br>A special alloy insulator with high damping effect is used for the insulator.<br><br>PC-OCC is used for the circuit wire, and a glass-epoxy substrate with gold-plated through holes, which is resistant to changes over time, is used for the substrate, greatly improving transmission efficiency.<br>It also includes original audio parts such as the OFC center bus bar and specially developed capacitors, diodes and transformers.<br><br>The power supply is equipped with a newly developed 100 VA transformer for audio.<br>In addition, the power cord uses an extremely thick type with polarity indication to improve the transmission performance of both digital and analog systems.<br><br>45-bit noise-shaping with 45-bit noise shaping enables extremely high-quality CD playback at low levels.<br><br>A newly developed soft mute mechanism is incorporated to prevent unpleasant noise generated during manual mute operation.<br>This function smoothly attenuates noise caused by waveform distortion in manual mute mode to eliminate noise.<br><br>Equipped with a soft mute phase switching mechanism, the absolute phase switching of the stereo signal is digitally processed to eliminate unpleasant noise.<br><br>Equipped with FL brightness adjustment mechanism that can continuously adjust the display to the desired brightness.</p>
