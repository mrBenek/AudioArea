				<p class="detail">A non-feedback MC head amplifier with an ideal transparent amplifier and a super linear circuit for MC in the circuit.<br><br>It uses a super linear circuit for MC consisting of a nonlinear absorption circuit and a voltage amplifier.<br>The H-Z1 employs a low-noise FET in order to greatly improve the SN ratio. By driving the current push-pull, the second power characteristic (non-linearity) of the FET is canceled, and excellent linearity without distortion is obtained.<br><br>A silicon carbide shielded power transformer is used for the power transformer.<br>In this transformer, high-purity oxygen-free copper wire is used for the winding, and by using a balanced winding, the voltage value after commutation is made uniform and stable regulation is obtained. In addition, by using a toroidal core, leakage flux is reduced. This prevents the transformer from affecting other parts and eliminates sound quality degradation caused by induction hum.<br>In addition, porous silicon carbide ceramic is used for the transformer case to prevent distortion due to electromagnetic induction from the outside.<br><br>Aluminum electrolytic capacitor Non-inductive electrolytic capacitor is adopted.<br>Unlike ordinary electrolytic capacitors, this capacitor employs a method in which all the electrode foils of the capacitor are made into electrodes by special welding, thereby realizing a significant reduction in inductance.<br>A resin case coated with a special conductive material is used inside the case to shield the elements from external magnetic fields.<br><br>We have adopted newly developed film capacitors for audio equipment as small-capacity capacitors.<br>The film is made of a composite structure consisting of polycarbonate with low tan δ (dielectric loss) and polypropylene with high insulation and excellent high-frequency characteristics. This is rolled up hard at low speed and high tension to eliminate wrinkles and mechanical stress that often occur in the past and to prevent intermodulation distortion caused by squeal.<br>In addition, the device is double-shielded with a conductive film coating and a special case to prevent the effects of external electrolysis.<br><br>Uses a glass case electrolytic capacitor in which the case is replaced with glass to prevent the generation of eddy current.<br><br>When signal current flows, electromagnetic waves are generated and leaked from electronic components, and interactions between channels and electromagnetic waves are reflected by metal objects, causing distortion of the signal current itself and causing deterioration of sound quality. To prevent this, a special electromagnetic wave absorber is used in the H-Z1.<br>This is a multi-layer carbon-containing urethane foam sheet that prevents the induction of electromagnetic waves inside and outside the amplifier. In addition, the top plate is made of glass coated with highly reliable silicon carbide as an electromagnetic wave shield. This improves the audibility that does not appear in the specifications.<br><br>The printed circuit board uses glass epoxy, which has excellent mechanical strength and electrical high-frequency characteristics.<br>The copper foil is made of 99.99% pure oxygen-free copper with a thickness of 280 μ m, about eight times that of conventional copper foil. This reduces DC resistance to 1/8 of conventional copper foil and greatly reduces inductance.<br><br>The fuse is an audio fuse that uses pure copper for the base material instead of conventional brass.<br>This not only improves the conductor resistance by nearly 30%, but also prevents the occurrence of non-linear distortion between different metals inside the alloy by switching from alloy to pure metal.<br>In addition, tin, a non-magnetic material, is used instead of nickel, a magnetic material, for the plating material of the electrode.<br><br>We are also working to improve the quality of the power cord. We have adopted oxygen-free copper as the conductive material, and by improving the conductivity, loss in the wire is reduced and non-linear distortion is greatly reduced.<br>The insulation covering the conductor is made of polyethylene with low conductivity for low loss, low loss, low capacity and low distortion. In addition, the double insulation structure covered with polyvinyl chloride of 1.6 mm thickness prevents conductor vibration such as cord noise generated when current flows.<br>In addition, the polarity of the plug is indicated, and the polarity is controlled from the core wire of the power cord to the wiring inside the body to improve the sound quality.<br><br>We have developed and adopted a fast recovery diode with high high-speed response for the rectifier diode.<br>This reduces power supply noise.<br><br>In order to solve the problem of non-linearity between dissimilar metals, copper-containing solder is used. In addition, oxygen-free copper wire with 99.99% purity is used from the inlet to the outlet.<br><br>Equipped with a gain switching function that can be switched in two stages and a 4-position cartridge load.</p>
