				<p class="detail">Phono equalizer with independent configuration of MM/MC.<br><br>In order to minimize the transmission distance to the analog player, a compact design has been adopted that allows grounding near the player.<br><br>The E-03 employs a 4-amp configuration with independent amplifiers for MM/MC in addition to the left and right channels. It is compatible with all cartridges with impedance values around it, including the orthophone type with internal impedance of 2 Ω and the 40 Ω denon type.<br><br>The MM amplifier consists of a differential amplifier circuit using two high-Gm dual FETs per channel in parallel for the first stage, a P-type low-noise dual transistor for the second stage, and a high-gain emitter-follower connection for the current amplifier stage.<br>The MC amplifier circuit configuration consists of four High-Gm dual FETs per channel connected in parallel to the first stage differential circuit, receiving the differential by the next stage P-channel transistor, and combining a current mirror circuit to ensure high gain. The final stage emitter-follower circuit is a two stage Darlington connection with high current amplification.<br>Both the MM and MC circuits use the same type of element for matching tone.<br><br>It uses an NF-type equalizer that can simplify the circuit and is also advantageous in terms of S/N.<br>The NF-type equalizer suffers from the problem of a high-pass rise in the corrected frequency response, but the E-03 solves this problem by determining the constant using computer simulation and realizes an extremely flat RIAA curve.<br>In addition, the feedback circuit uses an AC/DC-separated feedback duo-beta circuit that is highly evaluated as an original circuit of Lux. In addition, the excellent RIAA deviation is realized by using a lot of high-precision, high-sound quality parts developed in Shinkai exclusively for E-03.<br><br>In order to achieve pure signal transmission, the MM/MC equalizer is switched to the ground side at the output stage rather than at the input stage, so that the signal from the weak cartridge is input to the equalizer circuit without passing through the selector switch.<br>In addition, the switch that selects the output signal to the amplifier short-circuits the input of the circuit side that is not selected by the relay, and the crosstalk performance is also examined. In addition, the short relay on the input prevents the adverse effect of the offset voltage on the cartridge when the power is turned on and realizes the demagnetization effect.<br><br>The transformer used in the power supply unit is designed with strict measures against leakage flux from the design stage. The magnetic flux density is set at 9,000 gauss to suppress leakage flux generation itself. The core of the EI transformer is shielded with copper, and the transformer is placed in a double shield structure. The transformer is mounted in a mechanical floating mount system to prevent vibration.<br>In addition, the secondary winding of the transformer consists of three windings that are independent of the Route 3 of the MM/MC / control circuit. After rectification, a regulator circuit is installed for each left and right channel to eliminate mutual interference between amplifiers and channels via the power supply.<br><br>Non-interference construction is used for the internal construction. Each circuit is completely separated from the chassis center to prevent mutual interference. In addition, the signal amplifier circuit and the power supply circuit are separated by a shielding plate while being arranged at the shortest distance.<br>In addition, an optimum constant voltage power supply is arranged independently for each of 4 amplifiers of L/R and MM/MC.<br><br>A 2-core shielded cable is used for the signal cable to cut off noise that tends to mix in the transmission line.<br><br>The E-03 has an all-discrete configuration for all circuits, including accessory circuits such as relay controls, eliminating the IC-specific coloring.<br><br>Custom-made high-quality parts are used, and glass-epoxy circuit boards and polystyrene capacitors in copper cases are used.</p>
