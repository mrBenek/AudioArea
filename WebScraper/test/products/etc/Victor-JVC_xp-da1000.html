				<p class="detail"><br>D/A converter of the laboratory ratory series.<br><br>Equipped with Victor&#39;s original K2 interface.<br>The K2 interface is a circuit that pays attention to the fact that out-of-code components such as jitter and ripple have a great effect on sound quality. It is designed to eliminate these out-of-code components just before D/A conversion.<br>The principle of this circuit is to first detect only the code information from the waveform of the digital input signal by high-speed switching operation of the semiconductor. Then, based on this information, a new digital waveform is created on another block. By this circuit, the waveform transmission by the electric signal is changed to the code transmission once, and the non-code component contained before passing through the K2 interface is electrically cut off.<br><br>The XP-DA1000 detects the clock from the digital input signal and controls the K2 interface circuit by generating a stable master clock based on the clock detected by the digital input signal and using the PLL circuit with an extremely high oscillation precision to control the K2 interface circuit. This enables extremely accurate code detection. In addition, it is equipped with a sync terminal that supplies a high-precision master clock. When combined with a CD player that supports generator lock, the digital signal pickup can be controlled by the master clock of the XP-DA1000 without using the clock generation circuit on the player side.<br>This full synchronization allows the K2 interface to run ideally.<br><br>Although the code data is transmitted digitally, the time data that controls the timing of the code is analog transmission. If these two signals are transmitted as an input digital signal on a single line, interference between D and A may occur.<br>To solve this problem, the XP-DA1000 uses a method of separating the input digital signal into code data and time data and transmitting it to the K2 interface via two optical cables.<br>In addition, the optical cable is installed in a spiral shape to attenuate high-order reflection modes and eliminate time lag of transmission signals.<br><br>The D/A converter uses an 8 fs full-time 20-bit combination 4 dac.<br>In the XP-DA1000, the quality is improved by the orthodox current addition method in which the low-order bit which is difficult to pursue the accuracy is made into the discrete structure. Moreover, the full-time 20 bit is realized while theoretically eliminating the 0 cross distortion by the total 4 combination DACs in which the LR is made to be independent. Furthermore, in order to always operate the full-bit correctly, the manual labor is added. The bit adjustment is done carefully one by one, and the minute resolution of the full-time 20 bit is achieved in actual operation, and the quantization noise is reduced as much as possible.<br><br>The output of the D/A converter uses a current transmission method with an excellent S / N ratio. The I/V converter is an ultra-high-speed conversion type, and the operating point is carefully adjusted to maintain high characteristics without variation.<br>In addition, the converter amplifier uses a high-speed amplifier circuit to provide the same level of output and margin as a 10W power amplifier to enhance stability.<br><br>PCOCCC oxygen-free copper is used for the signal line.<br><br>The internal structure adopts 8-block construction, and it is a shield structure of communication equipment grade to cope with the interference to the delicate analog part strictly.<br>The digital I/O board, digital signal processing section and analog signal processing section of the K2 interface, digital filter, D/A converter and three power supply sections are structurally separated and clearly separated.<br>In addition, each circuit is shielded with a pure silver coating case to eliminate all leakage of digital noise and power supply leakage.<br><br>In order to eliminate adverse effects caused by vibration, each block has an independent vibration-free and vibration-free structure.<br>All digital circuits, K2 interface circuits and analog circuits are floating mounted with special vibration damping materials to eliminate sound quality degradation due to vibration and sound pressure.<br>In addition, the power supply part where the transformer itself vibrates is especially taken into consideration. The transformer is held down by a rigid rigid structure and floating.<br><br>The power supply unit is composed of three completely independent power sources.<br>The encoder, decoder and analog sections of the input are supplied with a dedicated power supply, and each section is equipped with an independent transformer. This provides a stable power supply and eliminates the influence of off-code components that enter the analog section through the power supply.<br><br>Three types of master clock generators are available for 32 kHz, 44 kHz and 48 kHz so that they can be used for different sampling frequency sources. As a result, the number of input / output terminals is also increased.<br><br>For the analog output, an active balance circuit with DC amplifier configuration is adopted, and highly reliable connection with a power amplifier is possible.<br><br>The terminal board is separate from the rear panel to eliminate eddy currents.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
