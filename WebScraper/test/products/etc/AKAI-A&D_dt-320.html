				<p class="detail">Audio timer with Weekly 8 program and Route 3 AC outlet control.<br><br>It is equipped with 8 program functions per week applying microcomputer technology, and 8 patterns of timer reservation are possible.<br>Each program can specify multiple desired days of the week at random, so that only a certain day of the week can be timed, or a set of programs such as skip days or every day can be set.<br>You can also choose Repeat to continue the program weekly or One Time to keep the program running for only one week.<br><br>Equipped with A/B/C Route 3 AC outlet control.<br>Since the AC Out can be controlled by three combinations of A + C, B+ C, and A + B+ C for each program, it is possible to record the absence and play the alarm by combining multiple decks and tuners.<br><br>Equipped with a triple display function, it can display three types of time : current time in seconds, timer ON time, and timer OFF time.<br>In addition, all input information such as program number, AC out, day of week, Repeat, etc. can be displayed centrally with a large 2-color FL tube.<br><br>A 2-color FL tube is used for the display.<br><br>Equipped with a one touch program check function, you can check the program contents just by pressing the program number key.<br><br>Equipped with a sensor light guide system.<br>The operation keys and display are laid out from left to right according to the operation procedure. The key to be operated next lights up. Moreover, the display part corresponding to the key operation flashes, making sure setting is possible.<br><br>It uses a touch tone mechanism to confirm key operation with electronic sound.<br><br>The current time display is a 2-way display of 12/24 hours.<br>It can also be used as a high-precision quartz clock by turning off only the program part display with the program display switch.<br><br>Equipped with an auto-dimmer sensor, it automatically adjusts the brightness of the display according to the brightness of the room.<br><br>It uses shift keys in the forward and reverse directions for easy program modification.<br><br>Equipped with a sleep timer mechanism that can be set every 1 minute up to 99 minutes.<br><br>Equipped with a one touch 0 second reset mechanism, the second can be adjusted easily by pressing the second set key simultaneously with the time signal when the current time is set.<br><br>It is equipped with a memory saving mechanism. For programs with a single day of the week specified as One Time, the memory contents are retained even after the timer operation ends. However, the program is only stored in memory and does not operate.<br><br>Equipped with an auto program cancellation mechanism, the memory of the One Time program for which multiple days of the week are specified is automatically cancelled after the end of timer operation at the end of the week and becomes an empty program.<br><br>If an input operation is interrupted, the program will be automatically cancelled after a certain period of time.<br><br>Built-in memory backup battery retains memory contents for more than 30 minutes in case of power failure or power cut.<br><br>In combination with the separately sold quartz synthesizer tuner AT-S61, you can control the preset station of the AT-S61 when you set the program. The DT 320 also allows you to select the FM/AM band. After selecting the band, you can reserve up to five FM/AM stations together with the time reservation.</p>
