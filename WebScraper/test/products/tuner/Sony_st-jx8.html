				<p class="detail">Based on the know-how of the ST-J75, which raised the quality of the synthesizer tuner by gathering Sony&#39;s IC technology, the circuit and material were re-examined and the synthesizer tuner aimed at higher perfection.<br><br>A direct comparator using Sony&#39;s original high-speed PLL IC is used.<br>This circuit employs a high-speed PLL IC that can directly divide frequencies up to the ultra-high frequency of 220 MHz. The comparison frequency from the crystal is set at 100 kHz, which is the same as the reception step. As a result, the comparison frequency is shifted to a band far away from the main signal and 38 kHz sub signal of the stereo signal, and noise and beat are greatly reduced.<br>In addition, in order to further improve the quality of wide-band ratio detection, a dedicated detection driver IC is adopted. By connecting this output directly to a DC composite amplifier with a wide dynamic range, the front and rear of the detection transformer are firmly suppressed, greatly contributing to the improvement of the SN ratio.<br><br>An FET buffer amplifier for impedance matching with the IF stage is mounted at the end of the front end. In addition, a uniphase filter of two elements and one package is used, and a differential limiter amplifier is inserted between stages to use four filters.<br>These 10-stage differential amplifiers provide excellent phase characteristics in the passband and rapid attenuation in the out-of-band region. These amplifiers greatly eliminate adjacent station interference while maintaining clear sound quality.<br><br>For the front end section, an all-FET configuration is adopted, such as 5-stage varicap, RF amplifier and mixer using dual gate MOS-FET, with special emphasis on RF intermodulation interference.<br>This eliminates non-linearity and provides stable reception performance against strong electric field input and spurious interference.<br><br>The MPX section employs a PLL-MPX ・ IC with a built-in pilot cancellation circuit that largely eliminates the pilot signal.<br>In addition, a 3-pole linear phase filter is adopted to eliminate unwanted signals of 15 kHz or higher to achieve low distortion and high separation.<br>It also uses a high-slew rate DC amplifier and a stabilized power supply.<br><br>Equipped with a 3-stage high / low / off muting level switching switch.<br>The muting level can be divided into two steps : High where the stereo broadcast transmission is almost practical, and Low where it is almost practical if it is made into a thing. In addition, when it is turned off, an FM blend circuit is automatically activated, and the SENS mechanism is installed to improve the acoustic sensitivity.<br><br>The AM tuner section uses a notch filter that greatly reduces beat noise.<br>The AMIF and AF bands can be switched to three levels : Distant, Normal, and Local. The SENS mechanism is activated when the AMIF and AF bands are set to Muting-off (when the display is Distant). Not only the high band but also the low band can be cut to improve the actual sensitivity.<br><br>It is equipped with FM/AM direct random 8 station preset using multi-process memory. It can preset up to 8 stations at any position regardless of FM/AM. In addition, each station can record settings such as FM/AM band, muting, SENS, and FM mode. You can call up the desired station while keeping the optimum reception condition with one touch.<br>In addition to this direct random tuning system, we have adopted a 4-speed tuning system consisting of a quick search (auto) that automatically selects neighboring stations, a sweep tune (manual) that changes frequency slowly, and a step tune (manual) that changes in FM100kHz and AM9kHz steps per one touch.<br><br>Equipped with a timer compatible 8-station program memory, it is possible to recall up to 8 specified preset stations one after another in order in conjunction with ON/OFF of the power switch.<br>This allows you to easily record between two or more stations using a program timer.<br>It is also equipped with a memory scan function to easily check the programmed station and order, and NEXT CALL to check the station to be called when the switch is turned on next time.<br><br>The memory IC uses Sony&#39;s proprietary non-volatile memory IC that does not require any backup power supply and retains the memory contents semi-permanently.<br>Even in the event of a power failure, there is no need to worry about the memory being released, and you can use it safely to record your absence with a weekly timer.<br><br>Equipped with a CAL-TONE switch that is convenient for adjusting the air check level.<br><br>Equipped with 5-step LED signal indicator with strong electric field display.<br><br>FM antenna terminal with F-type plug for 75 Ω coaxial cable is seen through.<br>A 300 Ω feeder antenna can be used by the included adapter (EAD-25).<br><br>Equipped with Last One Memory that recalls the station you were listening to when you turned off the power when you turned the power on.<br><br>7-segment digital display is adopted.<br><br>In order to emphasize sound quality, a copper-plated case and oxygen-free copper power cord with polarity display are used.<br><br>The audio amplifier uses a 2-power supply system with FET buffer.</p>
