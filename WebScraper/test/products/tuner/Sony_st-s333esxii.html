				<p class="detail">FM/AM tuner which adopted analog sense tune by tuning dial.<br><br>Equipped with a tuning dial. There are three operation modes : manual, which has the same feeling as conventional analog tuners, auto, which starts searching for radio waves automatically by turning a little to either left or right and stops when it is found, and dial preset scan, which calls up 20 preset memories one after another by turning the tuning dial.<br><br>The generation of digital noise is greatly reduced by suspending the operation of the microcomputer except when necessary for operation.<br>In the ST-S333ESXII, when no operation is performed for approximately 10 seconds, the condition is maintained in the peripheral circuit and the microcomputer is deactivated.<br><br>The FM antenna terminal is located almost in the center of the rear panel, making it possible to lay out the power supply part located almost in the center of the board so that each part surrounds it. In addition, the ground reference point is also placed in the power supply part, from which it supplies power to each stage.<br>As a result, the power supply and each stage can be connected at the shortest distance, reducing the power supply impedance, preventing loops from forming in the power supply system, and reducing sound quality degradation by connecting each stage at the shortest distance.<br><br>It is equipped with a switch that can pass the MPX filter if necessary.<br><br>It is equipped with a direct comparator, which employs a PLL IC that can directly handle frequencies as high as 220 MHz. This raises the comparison frequency to 100 kHz, which is the same as the channel plan of Japanese FM stations, and reduces noise and by interference with the pilot signal.<br><br>To prevent the vibration of the transformer from being transmitted to the chassis, the transformer and the chassis are mechanically floated using materials with different specific acoustic impedance, and an ES filter is used to improve the frequency characteristics of the transformer winding itself.<br><br>The LC filter, which causes distortion and other sound quality degradation, is eliminated from the detection stage to the output terminal of the tuner, and an active filter is used for the MPX filter.<br><br>To prevent the resist material from increasing the capacitance between the patterns, we have adopted a unique ES substrate with a resist material placed only on the copper foil.<br><br>An SST circuit (Super Sound Tracing Circuit) is mounted to reduce distortion at the front end.<br>At the SST circuit, in order to reduce tracking errors, the frequency band from 76 MHz to 90 MHz is divided into four bands, and the error range is reduced by adjusting each band point.<br><br>It is equipped with WOIS (Wave Optimaized IF System) which optimizes IF waveform to achieve both high selectivity and high sound quality.<br>When an IF filter with a narrow bandwidth is used in order to improve the interference rejection capability, simply narrowing the bandwidth and increasing the selectivity will result in a deviation from the originally required parabolic curve and distortion. In WOIS, compensation curves are created and synthesized to form an IF filter with a narrow bandwidth and a parabolic curve.<br>In the case of a monaural signal, a curve to correct the group delay characteristics of the filter is created and synthesized.<br><br>Equipped with WODD (Wave Optimized Direct Detector) to improve the performance of the detector stage.<br>In the WODD, we focus on the fact that the feedback capacitance of the FET, which is an oscillation element in the VCO circuit, shows non-linearity at the operating frequency, which is opposite to that of a varactor diode. Create a linear VCO by overlapping two curves.<br><br>The MPX part is equipped with WODSD (Wave Optimized Digital Stereo Decoder).<br>In WODSD, a 38 kHz square wave and a square wave obtained by the balanced multiplication of 38 kHz and 114 kHz are added together to produce a switching signal that is less likely to generate third harmonic waves, thereby suppressing beats caused by interference with 100 kHz disturbance waves.<br><br>It is equipped with program memory function corresponding to timer of 4 stations.<br><br>It is equipped with functions such as memory scan and cartone.</p>
