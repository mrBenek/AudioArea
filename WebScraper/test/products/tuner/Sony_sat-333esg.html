				<p class="detail">This BS tuner uses cutting-edge video and digital audio technology to achieve high picture and sound quality.<br><br>The newly developed pulse D/A converter is used for the D/A converter.<br>This converter converts digital signals into 1 and 0 pulses at high speed, and expresses music waveforms by changing the density of the pulses. As a result, there is in principle no differential non-linear distortion, glitch, or 0 cross distortion that would have been difficult to eradicate with the staircase Namikata method.<br><br>Equipped with two digital audio output terminals that are coaxial with the optical system.<br><br>The Y/C signal separation device uses a CCD dynamic comb filter that is used in commercial equipment. This filter compares three scanning lines and determines whether or not there is a correlation between them to perform the most effective Y/C separation. Compared with conventional comb filters, the addition of the element of determining the correlation and the improvement of the frequency characteristics by the CCD enables high-precision Y/C separation and provides S image output with clear contours.<br><br>It uses a PLL type FM detector and a PLL frequency synthesizer channel selection system to obtain stable images.<br><br>You can display information such as received received channel, audio mode, stereo / mono, main / sub, etc. on the TV screen in an overlapping manner.<br>It is also equipped with Sony&#39;s unique antenna input level display function with peak hold.<br><br>Equipped with a 3-step program memory function that operates in conjunction with a separately sold timer, etc. and calls up the set channel and main / sub of sound when the power is turned on.<br>Each time the power is turned on, the next memory is called up. When this function is not used, the last channel memory function is activated to store the channel you were watching before turning the power off.<br><br>It is equipped with three timer recording linked functions that can be selected according to the VCR to be connected when recording satellite broadcasting.<br>With the BS control method, you can activate and select channels by using the BS control function of the video, as if you were operating a built-in video tuner.<br>In addition, with the linked AC outlet method, if the video is equipped with a timer linked AC outlet, it is possible to reserve the timer using the program memory function by supplying power from the outlet.<br>In the power-on sensing method, the video is powered from the AC outlet dedicated to the VCR of the SAT 333 ESG, so that the SAT 333 ESG senses when the video is powered on and the SAT 333 ESG starts up simultaneously.<br><br>Two video output systems and two audio output systems are installed, and a gold-plated plug with low contact resistance is installed.<br><br>It is equipped with an RFU Daptor output terminal to which an RFU adapter (sold separately) can be connected so that it can be used even on TV without video / audio input.<br><br>It is equipped with one keyed AFC input, two bit-stream outputs, and two sensing outputs so that a down converter for watching HDTV broadcasting on a normal TV and a data channel decoder for facsimile broadcasting can be connected.<br><br>Equipped with a GOOD RECEPTION display function to clearly indicate good radio wave conditions.<br><br>Digital sound can be turned ON/OFF.<br><br>It is equipped with a concentrated display by 3-color fluorescent display tube.<br><br>Equipped with a display mode button that allows you to turn on all lights / channel indicators and button lights / channel only lights.<br><br>Uses OFC power cord.<br><br>Equipped with a headphone port with volume.<br><br>It comes with a wireless remote control that allows you to perform most operations at hand, including power ON/OFF and channel selection.</p>
