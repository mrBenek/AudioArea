				<p class="detail">ES series prestige model CD player with advanced pulse D/A converter.<br><br>The D/A converter employs a high-density linear converter system, equipped with a newly developed advanced pulse D/A converter (CXD 2562) and a new version of a 45-bit noise-shaping digital filter (CXD 2560).<br><br>The Advanced Pulse D/A converter is a further development of the characteristics of conventional pulse D/A converters. It employs third order noise shaping to reduce the maximum quantization noise in the audible band and to avoid a sudden increase in noise outside the audible band. On top of this, it employs a newly developed high-precision arithmetic method developed by Sony that enables multiple quantization outputs (higher pulse output density). This increases the number of pulses output per unit time and increases the pulse density to achieve a more accurate musical waveform.<br>In addition, the advanced pulse D/A converter has two PLM (pulse length modulation) wave outputs that are complementary to each other, and two PLM wave outputs that are complementary to each other. The 4D/A output of the advanced pulse D/A converter is an 8D/A output that is one channel of the 4D/A output of the PLM wave 2 outputs that are complementary to each other. The 4D/A complimentary service PLM consists of two PLM wave outputs that are complementary to each other. The 4D/A output is a differential amplifier that combines two PLM wave outputs that are complementary to each other. The 4D/A cancels out harmonic distortion that is noticeable when signal frequencies are high or amplitude levels are large.<br>In addition, the CDP 777 esa has a two chip advanced pulse D/A converter IC and a two chip mode in which D/A conversion is performed independently on the LR channel, further enhancing the separation characteristics.<br><br>To take advantage of the advanced pulse D/A converter, a 45-bit noise-shaping digital filter is incorporated in the front stage.<br>In this circuit, a high dynamic range is obtained by performing a high-precision oversampling operation and a first order noise shaping operation on the result of the operation before outputting it to a pulse D/A converter.<br><br>A direct digital sink is used to prevent degradation of sound quality due to jitter.<br>In this method, the master clock is formed on the same chip of the pulse D/A converter, and the jitter is removed immediately before the electronic switch, which is the final stage of the pulse D/A converter, thereby reducing sound quality degradation due to jitter.<br><br>The analog low-pass filter is a GIC type low-pass filter with no series passive elements such as capacitors, and the line amplifier is a DC servo amplifier with no coupling capacitors directly connected to the audio signal path.<br>In addition, the output stage has an A-class FET that has a smooth rise and is suitable for small-signal amplification.<br>The CDP 777 esa also uses an FET at the input stage, and the high-impedance input characteristic of FET is used to thoroughly separate noise components from the low-pass filter at the front stage.<br><br>The servo circuit uses a high-precision digital servo.<br>In this circuit, the signal from the optical pickup is A/D converted, filtered and controlled by digital processing, and then D/A converted again to operate the optical pickup. This enables the servo amount to be adjusted according to each disc.<br>The high-precision servo uses a high-sampling rate, high-precision, high-resolution A/D converter and D/A converter to realize an ideal servocontrol and low power consumption by digitizing.<br><br>A fine drive is used to prevent noise components that adversely affect sound from flowing into the ground line.<br>In this system, the drive circuit of the optical pickup is composed of balanced push-pull by ± 2 power supply system capable of canceling the in-phase noise component, and noise current mixing is eliminated.<br><br>G-base unit is adopted for the base of the mechanical deck.<br>The G-base unit is made by adding calcium carbonate, which has the same composition as marble, to a special resin and reinforcing it with glass fiber to prevent loss of trace accuracy due to vibration and resonance.<br>In addition, the CDP 777 esa uses copper-plated copper-tight metal that is thick enough to serve as a base for the chassis to further eliminate vibration.<br><br>The spindle motor that rotates the disk is equipped with a BSL motor that achieves high precision and high quiet rotational performance with little cogging. The spindle bearing is made of sapphire with high hardness and low friction coefficient, providing high durability.<br><br>An acoustic shield is adopted, and a damper made of a special rubber material is provided in the opening of the front panel where the tray is stored to improve airtightness. This reduces the effect of air vibration entering through the tray lid.<br>The tray itself is a G-tray made of the same material as the G-base unit. In addition, a stayable lock mechanism is provided to fix both sides of the tray with lock arms during performance to improve vibration control during performance.<br><br>The FB chassis is used for the chassis, and vibration is eliminated by the surrounding frame and the structure in which the whole chassis is firmly jointed by the beams passing from front and rear to front and rear.<br>In addition, the inside of the chassis is plated with copper and a high-rigidity aluminum top plate is used to make the chassis nonmagnetic.<br><br>A center mechanical mounting system is adopted, and the mechanical deck is placed in the center of the chassis to minimize the rotational moment applied to the chassis and improve the stability against vibration.<br><br>The legs are equipped with a fine ceramic insulator.<br><br>The audio circuit board and digital circuit board are separated in a separate sheet configuration, and the digital circuit board is moved to the lower part of the mechanical deck to minimize noise from the digital part to the audio part.<br>In addition, high-strength glass-epoxy ES substrates are used for the digital circuit, audio circuit, and power circuit boards to prevent deterioration of sound quality caused by internal vibration and electrostatic floating capacity.<br><br>The power supply section uses a 2-transformer configuration that supplies power to the digital servo section and audio section independently. The CDP 777 ESA uses a twin-core transformer in which two transformers are enclosed together in a shield case with anti-vibration measures.<br>In addition, the D/A converter section, which is important for sound quality, is equipped with a dedicated power supply circuit to eliminate interference from the power supply. In addition, in terms of mechanism, rubber dampers are used in four locations to prevent transmission of transformer vibration.<br><br>Aluminum front panel is used for the front panel.<br><br></p>
