				<p class="detail">Stereo cassette deck incorporating TRIO&#39;s unique TLLE constant current drive system.<br><br>TRIO&#39;s original constant-current drive recording amplifier has been adopted. Unlike conventional quasi-constant-current drive circuits, it does not require a series resistance at the output section, thus greatly improving the dynamic range of the recording amplifier.<br>In addition, since the current flowing through the recording head is controlled by the recording amplifier itself, it is not affected by the impedance change of the recording head, which becomes a load, and ideal recording that can obtain uniform magnetic flux in all frequency bands is possible.<br><br>We have developed and adopted TRIO&#39;s original constant-current drive circuit TLLE, which has two loops for head drive and gain control, and is DC-connected to the recording head with ± 2 power supplies.<br>As a result, high-quality and high-sound recording is realized without current transmission loss in the high-frequency range, and the dynamic range is greatly improved compared with the conventional method by eliminating the output resistance.<br>In addition, since the head drive current does not depend on the impedance change of the head, phase degradation does not occur, and current distortion caused by load fluctuation can be suppressed. Furthermore, since the recording head is directly connected to DC, flat recording is possible even in the ultra low frequency range.<br><br>The traveling system employs a highly rigid silent mechanism that has been developed by analyzing all vibration modes applied to the mechanism from various angles.<br>In addition, the mechanism body is simplified and a metal shaft is used for the guide to fix the cassette. In addition, a metal with high rigidity is used for the head base to install the head. Thus, the completion is improved and disturbance is suppressed.<br><br>All of the recording circuit, reproduction circuit, and Dolby B and C circuits use an op-amp type ± power supply circuit. The 0 potential of the earth is made clear to realize clear sound.<br>In addition, a constant voltage power supply of ± Line 5 is used for the power supply part to eliminate interference between each part.<br><br>Using a motor drive circuit with clear grounding, noise components generated by motor rotation are suppressed.<br><br>An amorphous alloy head is adopted for the head part. The head core is composed of 13 laminated sheets of 45 μ ultra-thin sheets of amorphous alloy with excellent insulation. This realizes a wide frequency characteristic with low overcurrent and extended high frequency range.<br>In addition, oxygen-free copper is used for the winding to improve transmission characteristics.<br><br>Focusing on the fact that the phase shift in the ultra-low frequency range has a significant effect on the sound image in the audible frequency range, we are developing a three dimensional analysis method using a computer and improving sound.<br><br>New IC is used for Dolby C type.<br><br>Auto functions such as leading one song forward and backward, leading one desired song, repeating one song, one side full repeat, dash and play, リレック standby, rewind play, 0 stop, index scan, blank search, auto trek mute, etc. are realized by NewDPSS.<br>The 4-digit linear counter is a DPSS indicator and is a multi-functional type that automatically switches as a residual quantity indicator.<br><br>There was a remote control unit sold separately.</p>
