				<p class="detail">The L series record player was commercialized based on the R-6197 released at the Audio Fair in 1978.<br><br>A direct drive system is adopted as the drive system.<br>In the Direct Drive, the wow flutter characteristics have been improved by introducing a quartz lock into the servo circuit. However, the braking force generated when the needle tip traces the sound groove with a large amplitude causes dynamic load fluctuations, and the sound quality deteriorates as sound is stretched or shortened.<br>To solve this problem, Kenwood has developed and adopted a double LOCK system that uses quartz to lock rotational fluctuations with low frequency components and inertia to lock transient load fluctuations. This concept is also applied to the L-07D. Moment of inertia : 1.025 ton ・ cm<sup>2</sup>The turntable and dynamic compen セーティッド quartz motor control rotational variation throughout the music band.<br><br>A slotless new quartz PLL servo motor is used for the drive motor.<br>This motor has a built-in dynamic compensator that automatically compensates for changes in load such as changes in bearing oil viscosity to eliminate adverse effects caused by temperature changes in bearing oil. In addition, the dynamic parameter (absolute compensation value) can be changed to account for large changes in absolute value due to changes in viscosity (such as when a disc stabilizer is used).<br>In addition, we have adopted a double servo coupling that automatically switches the control method at ± 3% of the rated speed. When starting within 3% of the constant speed, the phase control operation provides strong torque. When the constant speed is 3% or less, the phase control operation ensures a large lock range and phase range. When the constant speed is 3% or more, the circuit coupling is automatically changed from DC to AC operation within ± 3%. This prevents the influence of motor drive circuit and motor offset and protects the constant speed.<br><br>A high-rigidity compound vibration isolation turntable composed of 3 kinds of materials is adopted for the turntable.<br>In this system, duralumin of 4 mm thickness is pressed on the back surface of the turn table made of aluminum die-cast, and stainless steel of 5 mm thickness (SUS 304 type) is used for the table sheet. These materials have different resonance frequencies. The resonance peak of aluminum die-cast is suppressed by duralumin and stainless steel, and the resonance peak of duralumin is suppressed by aluminum die-cast and stainless steel, so that excellent vibration damping characteristics are exhibited throughout the music band.<br>In addition, the stainless steel of the table sheet material is non-magnetic, so the MC type cartridge can be used without worry.<br><br>A record player has a mechanical circuit (pickup loop) consisting of needle tip → tone arm → arm base → cabinet → turntable → needle tip. The accuracy of this circuit determines the quality of the player.<br>In the L-07D, a hard aluminum frame is inserted between the turntable and the tone arm. In addition, a 12 φ hard stainless steel is used for the Center shaft, which is the fulcrum of the turntable. In order to reduce the viscous resistance of the thrust part due to the weight of the turntable, a magne-float system is used for the motor. In addition, the pivot of the tone arm is made of superalloy, the rotating shaft is made of stainless steel, and the bearing is a large diameter bearing that is strong against vibration, making up a strong pickup loop.<br><br>The tone arm has a laminated structure of carbon fiber, boron fiber, carbon fiber and three kinds of four layers on a pipe made of ultra-hard aluminum. By combining different materials with different resonance frequencies, highly rigid compound vibration isolation is achieved.<br>In addition, in consideration of the effect of the displacement between the arm pipe and the holder part, the arm pipe is not only inserted into the holder part but also a brass pipe is inserted from the inside part. The holder part has a 6-layer 4-type high-rigidity composite anti-vibration structure.<br><br>Litz wires are used in all audio signal systems to reduce audio signal transmission loss, and thick gold plating is applied to all terminals to improve sound quality.<br>The arm extension has 7x8 strands of 0.05 φ litz wire to reduce DCR (direct current resistance), and is fixed to the center of the pipe arm to reduce the capacitance between lines.<br>The audio cord has a 2-core shield structure to improve cross-auto and signal-to-noise ratio. The conductor consists of 24x7 strands of 0.08 φ Litz wire. The connector uses a 23 φ gold plated plug of special specifications. The contact area of this plug is approximately 5 times that of conventional plugs.<br><br>The arm base adopts a collet chuck system with high crimping force. In addition, the arm shaft has a large diameter of φ 27.6 mm to ensure high rigidity.<br>This arm base is equipped with a helicoidal height adjustment mechanism similar to precision machine lathes, and the total arm height can be adjusted by 7 mm.<br><br>The head shell adopts a high-rigidity composite anti-vibration head shell made of carbon fiber and boron fiber.<br>Each material has improved mechanical strength against bending and twisting by stacking the fibers in different directions, resulting in a head shell that is resistant to vibration. In addition, the shell and connector are joined together by tightening with screws and nuts, which greatly improves strength compared with the conventional caulking method.<br>Litz wire is directly connected to the outlet pin to reduce contact resistance by reducing one point of contact.<br><br>In order to suppress resonance frequency, a high-rigidity composite vibration-proof cabinet using three different materials is adopted.<br>The L-07D uses two layers of high-rigidity new ARCB material (approximately 10 kg) and mahogany complexite (approximately 7 kg) to achieve wide-range vibration isolation. In addition, the positional relationship between the tone arm and the phono motor is clarified, and at the same time, a rigid aluminum frame (approximately 2 kg), which is effective in complex vibration isolation, is inserted to achieve extremely excellent vibration isolation characteristics.<br><br>The L-07D has a structure without an insulator.<br>The turntable rotates with respect to the cabinet. If this cabinet is floating with an insulator, the cabinet will vibrate due to the reaction generated by the rotational energy of the turntable. The vibration of the cabinet narrows the low frequency range and degrades the transient characteristics.<br>The L-07D is mechanically grounded by removing the insulator to ensure high vibration isolation characteristics.<br><br>The power supply has a separate structure, and by moving it away from the pickup loop, electromagnetic induction is prevented and sound quality is improved.<br>The main unit has a speed selector switch and a start / stop selector switch, and the power supply section has a power switch and a dynamic parameter selector switch.<br><br>The L-07D is equipped with a J-type universal tone arm as standard, but the cabinet part is designed for second arm, and one regular size tone arm can be additional use.<br>The arm base for additional arm is treated as an option.<br><br>It seems that L-07D has undergone some model changes during the sales period.<br>The photos are from the early catalog and the later catalog, so you can see the changes by comparing them.</p>
