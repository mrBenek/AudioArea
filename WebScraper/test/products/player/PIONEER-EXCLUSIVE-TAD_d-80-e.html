				<p class="detail">The reference DAT deck reduces mutual interference by adopting a midship mounting mechanism in which each part is independent.<br><br>The audio circuit board and digital circuit board are separated to the left and right, and the mechanism part is placed in the center to clarify the separation of each unit. The power transformer also uses a twin transformer that supplies energy to the audio and digital circuits independently.<br>This ensures the independence of each unit from power supply to layout, and reduces the mutual interference between circuits.<br><br>Both the A/D side and D/A side use 1-bit converters, so there is no problem of conversion error due to resistor error, and there is no non-linear distortion or 0 cross distortion in principle.<br>The D/A converter A converter is equipped with twin original high-speed pulse-flow D/A converters that operate with high oversampling of 256 fs and provide finer and smoother output.<br><br>In order to eliminate the fluctuation of the system clock, which is important for the 1-bit system, the signal processing section and the audio section each have their own clocks. In addition, we have newly developed a Clean Clock II circuit that combines a clock jitter suppressor circuit that captures the data transmitted from the signal processing section to the audio section and the transmission clock with the audio section&#39;s own clock, and a lithium tantalate oscillator to improve the sound quality.<br><br>The head is equipped with a high-output AT head.<br>Based on Pioneer&#39;s precision technology, this head adopts an All Track structure with 20 μ m uniform track processing in the track trace direction. In addition, to improve abrasion resistance, glass is welded to both sides of the head and special polishing processing is applied to the gap to realize stable tape touch.<br>Also, by increasing the reproduction output level by 2 to 6 dB, signal reading with low error rate is made possible.<br><br>Vibration is reduced by adopting a high-rigidity flat chassis for the mechanism part and by using a resin material with a high vibration isolation effect for the vibration source.<br>In addition, vibration is absorbed by adopting a cassette stabilizer structure in which the cassette half is held from the top and bottom by special rubber and the cassette is held from the left and right by resin to fix the cassette.<br><br>Information such as the program time of the source and the playing time of each song is recorded in the first position of the source, and it is equipped with a TOC (Table of contents) function in which the source can be enjoyed like a CD.<br>With this function, you can manage the source such as total number of songs and total time of the source, playing time of each song, starting time of each song, remaining time of the recorded part, etc.<br>Since the TOC information is recorded simply by recording the end ID and renumbering the TOC, various operations can be performed by using this TOC function.<br><br>It is equipped with an AI search function that utilizes the TOC information recorded at the beginning of the tape. It can search at a speed of approximately 300 times (approximately 600 times for LP) at the fastest speed. In addition, even if the tape does not have TOC information recorded on it, the program number is read by running the tape and the position is memorized by the microcomputer, making it possible to perform high-speed searches similar to those based on TOC information.<br><br>Equipped with digital faders, fade in and fade out function both during digital input recording, analog input recording and playback.<br>In addition, as operation functions during playback, it is equipped with functions such as random play, which selects and plays music at random based on TOC information, time skip, one point memory, fine queue / review, etc.<br><br>Equipped with LP mode capable of continuous recording / playback for up to 4 hours (when using 120 minutes of tape).<br><br>It is equipped with a digital meter that displays the recording level as it is after A/D conversion, and accurate level management is possible.<br><br>A 2mm-thick chassis with high rigidity is used for the bottom panel. In addition, vibration is absorbed by a large insulator, and panel stabilizers with rubber vibration isolators are used to suppress small vibrations around the front panel.<br><br>High quality is achieved by carefully selecting high-quality sound parts.</p>
