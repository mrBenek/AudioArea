				<p class="detail">A CD player with a Real 20-bit New Super Linear Converter.<br><br>Specifications such as appearance are slightly different between DCD-3500 and DCD-3500G.<br>The DCD 3500 is designed with a black aluminum front panel and side wood. The top panel is made of extruded aluminum with a thickness of 4 mm. The sides are made of side wood, steel plate and chassis. The legs are made of insulators made of sintered alloy covered with aluminum.<br>The DCD DCD 3500 g has a double structure of real wood and steel plate, and the legs have a 6.5 cm diameter brass machined large insulator with four pieces for a total of 1.8 kg.<br><br>The D/A converter is equipped with a newly developed real 20-bit New Super Linear Converter.<br>In the Super Linear Converter, the 0 cross distortion is eliminated by adding a correction signal to the D/A converter using a conversion error correction circuit. Unlike the dynamic bit shift method using an attenuator or switching circuit, this method does not have a factor of non-linear distortion. In addition, the 0 cross distortion, which is a problem at low volume, is caused by the resistance error of the MSB which is the most influential bit in D/A conversion. Therefore, the distortion is eliminated by correcting this MSB. Moreover, in the DCD 3500, not only the MSB but also the 4 bits of 2 sb, 3 sb and 4 sb are corrected, and the distortion is eliminated by eliminating the distortion of the entire waveform.<br>In addition, it employs a 2D/A system with independent left and right channels to eliminate the L/R time difference. The D/A conversion element uses an IC manufactured by Bar Brown of the United States.<br><br>The digital filter uses an 8 x oversampling digital filter. By increasing the sampling frequency by 8 x, the band gap between the music signal and the noise signal is widened, making it easier to remove noise components.<br>This allows the use of lower-order analog filters to improve sound quality.<br><br>The power supply section uses a super powerful twin power supply. By mounting one digital transformer and one analog transformer, digital noise is eliminated from the analog circuit.<br>In addition, the circuit board is divided into digital and analog circuits to completely eliminate mutual interference, and the bus bar line used in commercial machines are used for analog circuits to reduce impedance and prevent high frequency waves from jumping in.<br><br>In order to prevent interference between channels in analog circuits, the newly developed 20-bit converter is used independently on the left and right sides, and the analog circuits after the converter are completely independent of L/R according to the signal flow.<br><br>The pickup section uses a linear motor pickup mechanism to enable quick music selection and high-precision tracing.<br><br>The pick-up section is attached to a BMC (Bulk Molding Compound) with high rigidity and excellent vibration damping characteristics to enhance vibration absorption effect.<br>In addition, the DCD 3500 uses a double BMC base, which is fixed to a large BMC mechanical chassis and uses metal and BMC alternately to increase the vibration damping effect. The mechanical base floats twice from the mechanical chassis with low-impact rubber and springs.<br><br>The chassis is fully copper-plated to reduce electromagnetic noise and magnetostriction in space. In addition, the mechanism and power supply, which may cause vibration, and the circuit system, which depends on the effect of vibration, are divided into two parts with copper-plated partition walls in the center to eliminate the effect of internal vibration on sound quality.<br>The circulating noise from the 100 V line is handled by a line filter and an AC cord with polarity display.<br><br>The bottom has a four layer structure consisting of a bi-breath plate with two sheets of steel plates bonded together, a 1.6 mm thick steel plate and a copper-plated chassis.<br><br>Remote control electric volume is adopted.<br><br>The digital output is equipped with one optical system and two coaxial systems.<br>The analog output has one fixed balanced and one unbalanced system, and one variable unbalanced system.<br><br>It is equipped with a new time search function, and it is possible to start the music by time designation and repeat performance between 2 points.<br><br>Equipped with a 3-level display switching function, you can switch between standard ON, music calendar OFF and all OFF.<br><br>8 cm CD is supported.<br><br>It is equipped with a memory backup function, and you can timer play from your favorite music for about 2 days even when the power is turned off.<br><br>You can play at random or program up to 20 songs.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
