				<p class="detail">This DAT deck inherits the technology of the reference model DTC-1500ES and is equipped with a 4-head configuration for simultaneous recording and monitoring.<br><br>Equipped with SCMS (Serial Copy Management System), digital → digital recording from CD player, which was impossible until now, is possible only for one generation.<br>A SCMS-compatible DAT deck can record digitally to digitally using a CD as a master, but cannot record digitally to digitally using a recorded tape as a master. A tape recorded with an analog input can record digitally to digitally for one generation using a master, but cannot record digitally to digitally for the second generation using a master.<br>In the case of satellite broadcasting, it is also possible to produce digital second generation tapes based on digital recording tapes of digital audio output.<br>In either case, recording can be repeated using analog input / output only.<br><br>A 4-head configuration head drum is used. In addition to the conventional 2 heads for recording and playback, 2 heads for each set for monitoring are provided. As with 3-head tape decks and cassette decks, simultaneous recording and monitoring is possible.<br>You can switch between the source sound and the tape sound with a single touch with the Rec Monitor switch, and you can listen to the sound at any time during recording.<br><br>It uses a 4D. D. motor mechanism and has dedicated direct drive motors for the capstan, supply side reel, take-up side reel and head drum rotation. As a result, the mechanism can be designed simply with a margin and high reliability is obtained.<br>In addition, the cassette compartment uses an upright see-through type compartment where the tape running condition and label letters can be visually confirmed through a window.<br><br>The A/D converter is equipped with a 1-bit type A/D converter that can shift the unwanted spectrum generated by the A/D conversion far beyond the band of the music signal. Therefore, the low-pass filter that is inserted to prevent the generation of aliasing noise is also a light type with gentle characteristics.<br>This minimizes the deterioration of phase characteristics and group delay characteristics.<br><br>A 1-bit type pulse D/A converter is used for the D/A converter.<br>This D/A converter uses a single electronic switch to turn on / off one current source at a high speed of 5000 full bloom per second to express music signals as dense and coarse waves of pulses. In principle, there is no glitch, 0 cross distortion, or differential nonlinear distortion, and natural sound quality is obtained.<br><br>In the power supply section, transformers are independently mounted for the audio system, digital system, and other systems. The stabilizing power supply circuit is also constructed on an independent board. In addition, by symmetrically arranging the + power supply and - power supply components and wiring patterns, interference between each circuit is eliminated.<br><br>By separating the audio / digital circuit boards with shield plates and using a copper plated high-rigidity chassis, the generation of magnetic distortion due to eddy current is suppressed.<br>In addition, the top plate of DTC-1500ES is made of high-rigidity aluminum with a thickness of 3 mm, the audio system is grounded at one point by using a large copper plate, and the structure is further strengthened by the surrounding frame and beams that connect the front and rear parts.<br><br>It uses a software servo that is a substantial software version of the motor servo.<br>With software servo, various controls can be performed only by software settings. Therefore, in search and other operations, the tape can be searched slowly at the beginning and immediately before it stops, and at a maximum speed of approximately 200 times (at standard speed) during driving so as not to burden the tape.<br>It also helps to reduce sound generation time and improve cue / review sound.<br><br>It uses a newly developed second generation LSI that integrates signal processing such as error correction, RAM control and digital I/O into a single LSI. This LSI has an integration density of 20000 gates per LSI.<br>In addition, the microcomputer for controlling software servo and mechanism control is also integrated into a single LSI, enabling a significant reduction in the number of parts and a simple circuit board configuration, improving reliability and error correction capability.<br><br>It is equipped with subcode function unique to DAT.<br>The start ID is a subcode that indicates the beginning of a song. You can write the start ID in two modes : Auto, which writes the start ID automatically at the beginning of the song, and Manual, which allows you to write the start ID at your desired position. You can also erase the start ID if necessary.<br>The Skip ID is an ID that is written in the beginning of the part you want to listen to when you play the tape. If you find the Skip ID during playback, it is automatically fast-forwarded to the next Start ID. You can delete the Skip ID later.<br>If the end ED is written at the end of the required part, it is regarded as the end of the tape, and it is auto-rewound for playback and stopped for fast forward.<br><br>It is equipped with a rehearsal function for writing start ID and skip ID / end ID manually during playback, and point writing of A ⇔ B repeat.<br>During rehearsals, the point can be moved back and forth in units of 0.3 seconds while listening to and confirming the sound. The movement time is displayed on the display so that you can easily write to the just point. In addition, the already written start ID can be corrected during rehearsals.<br><br>You can assign a program number to the Start ID, and you can select songs directly by simply selecting the number with the 10 key during playback. The program number is automatically assigned when recording, and can also be used to manually write the Start ID.<br><br>Equipped with a renumbering function that renumbers the number from the head of the tape with one touch operation.<br><br>It is equipped with a Shift Number function that renumbers the start ID by adding it back in 0.3 second increments so that you can play the beginning of the track with plenty of time.<br><br>It is possible to record the absolute time which shows the absolute time from the tape top.<br><br>It is equipped with a date function, and based on the built-in dedicated clock, it can automatically record the current year / month / day / day of week / hour / minute / second / AM/PM in the subcode, and can be called up anytime during playback.<br><br>You can use Absolute Time to move the tape back and forth in minutes and search for the music you want to play or listen to.<br><br>You can search for the desired location by directly entering the absolute time of the desired location in hours / minutes / seconds with 10 keys.<br><br>AMS play is possible in which you can start the previous or next song according to the number of times you press the AMS button based on the song you are listening to.<br><br>It is equipped with program number search, and by using 10 key and play button jointly, you can directly find the music which recorded the program number of the number you pressed.<br><br>Equipped with a music scan function, you can search for the start ID one after another and play it for about 8 seconds each.<br>You can also change the playback time in the range of 1 to 15 seconds by pressing the buttons.<br><br>The specified program number and the entire tape can be repeated.<br>You can also repeat between A and B, repeating between specified points.<br><br>Equipped with an end search function, you can quickly search for an end ID or an unrecorded part that has never been recorded.<br><br>By using the included remote control, you can play 99 RMS songs by rearranging the program numbers (songs) in the order you like.<br><br>Equipped with long play mode capable of continuous recording for up to 4 hours (when using DT 120 r).<br><br>Fade in / fade out is possible by analog input recording and digital output / lineout output playback from tape. In addition, DTC-77ES/1500ES enables digital input recording.<br>The Fade In / Out Time can be set individually in a range from rapidly changing 0.2 seconds to slowly changing 15 seconds. It is also linked with the Pause function, so it can be used when editing and recording a DAT tape as a master to a cassette.<br><br>Equipped with equipped with two types of digital input / output terminals which are coaxial with optical input. The optical input and coaxial input can be switched with a switch on the front panel. The optical input uses a servo-type digital signal normalizer circuit which absorbs cable jitter.<br><br>Digital peak margin display is available, and digital display is available in dB units to indicate how much more recording level is available during recording.<br><br>It comes with a wireless remote control that can operate most of the body.<br>This remote control can also be used to select music and pose for a Sony remote-controlled CD player. Moreover, it can be used for wireless CD-synchronized recording, in which the recording pose of the CD player is released and the CD player starts playing.<br><br>The fs map function, which uses a digital peak level meter, provides a visual indication of the sampling frequency at which recording is being performed at an approximate location on the tape.<br>The upper part of the meter lights up at 32 kHz, the lower part lights up at 48 kHz, and both lights up at 44.1 kHz.<br><br>There are 2 variations, gold and black.<br>Also, the remote controller came with a color that matched each design.</p>
