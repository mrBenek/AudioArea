				<p class="detail">A 3-head cassette deck equipped with Dolby S NR.<br><br>Simultaneous recording monitoring unique to 3 heads makes it possible to compare and listen to the source sound source.<br><br>Equipped with Dolby S NR as a noise reduction system.<br>The Dolby S NR is a noise reduction system newly developed for consumer use based on the Dolby SR used in professional equipment. It realizes a noise reduction effect of 24 dB in the high range and 10 dB in the low range.<br>The ESJ Series is based on the Dolby S IC, which was developed by Dolby R &amp; D Laboratories and made into a chip by Sony. In addition, the ESJ Series uses high-density packaging technology to make it into a single module with peripheral components, thereby realizing both high sound quality and low cost.<br><br>High-quality signal transmission has been achieved by using single-crystalline ESC-OCC wire, which is a oxygen-free copper with a purity of 99.997% or more and has almost no grain boundaries, at important points.<br><br>A good weight balance is obtained by adopting a midship mechanical system in which the mechanical deck is placed in the center of the front panel.<br><br>The cassette holder is made of fine ceramic composite material with high rigidity and high specific gravity to reduce unnecessary vibration due to high rigidity. In addition, the cassette lid is made of extruded aluminum material to further improve accuracy.<br><br>The tape is loaded into the mechanical deck, and at the same time, the stabilizing device installed inside the cassette door firmly fixes the cassette half and osae komi the vibration of the tape.<br><br>Equipped with Dolby HX Pro, the effective bias amount is controlled to the optimum value in 1/1000 second unit to prevent over-bias and improve linearity in the high frequency range.<br>Also, Dolby HX Pro works only when recording, so recorded tapes are effective when played on any deck.<br><br>Super bias is adopted, and by greatly shifting up the frequency of bias signal, the frequency difference with audio signal is expanded, and beat noise and intermodulation distortion due to mutual interference are suppressed.<br><br>The built-in oscillator provides a bias calibration function that allows you to fine-tune the bias value within a range of ± 20% according to the tape to be used.<br>It is also equipped with a recording calibration function that eliminates the level difference between recording and playback due to tape sensitivity.<br><br>CD synchronized recording is possible by combining with Sony remote control compatible CD player.<br><br>It is equipped with an electronic counter that adopts FL tube. It is a linear type that displays minutes and seconds with a subtraction function that makes it easy to understand the remaining time.<br>It is also equipped with a peak level meter that displays the peak value of the music signal and a peak hold function.<br><br>It is equipped with an auto-monitor function that simplifies the operation playback. When you press the play button, it automatically switches from the Source position to the Tape position.<br><br>You can switch the display on and off with the remote control.<br><br>It is equipped with a multi-AMS function that can quickly cue up to 30 songs before and after.<br><br>It is equipped with the Auto Space REC MUTE function. When you press the REC MUTE button during recording or recording pause, it automatically records silence for approximately four seconds, sends the tape for that amount, and pauses.<br><br>It uses a power loading mechanism. If you press the play / fast-forward / rewind operation button without closing the cassette door, the cassette is automatically loaded into the mechanical deck and the operation mode shifts to each operation mode.<br>This series of operations can also be performed when the remote control is operated.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
