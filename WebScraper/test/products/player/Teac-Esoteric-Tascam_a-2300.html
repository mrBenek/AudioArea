				<p class="detail">This is a stereo tape deck developed by inheriting the technology of A-6010 which was the highest quality machine.<br><br>The A-2300 has a 3-motor, 3-head configuration and an orthodox one way recording / playback configuration.<br><br>The head section uses a hyperbolic type head that has good phase characteristics and enables recording and playback with less distortion up to high frequencies.<br>Since this head has excellent frequency characteristics and does not require excessive compensation, sound with little distortion can be obtained. In addition, since it is a hyperbolic type, excellent head touch is achieved, and disturbance of low-frequency characteristics due to contour effects is suppressed.<br>In addition to pursuing the core material of the head, the gap length and depth, the number of turns of the coil, and the shape, the recording and reproducing heads were made independent of each other to improve recording and reproduction characteristics.<br>In addition, all the heads of the teac are front shielded, so the separation of more than 50 dB between channels is achieved.<br><br>The equalizer stage of the reproduction amplifier uses a new 3-stage direct connection circuit that combines NPN-PNP-NPN transistors with high voltage utilization factor. This circuit can take out a larger output voltage than conventional circuits when the same power supply voltage is applied, ensuring an excellent dynamic range.<br>In addition, the line amplifier has an excellent linearity of more than 25 dB from the tape reference output by carefully selecting the operating point of the transistor and setting the level diagram carefully.<br><br>4-pole and 8-pole 2-speed hysteresis synchronous motors are used for the capstan motor in the mechanism. Combined with the dynamically balanced large capstan flywheel, it realizes stable tape travel and excellent wow and flutter characteristics.<br>In addition, the reel motor uses a 6-pole eddy current type inner rotor motor with less hunting and stronger starting torque. This makes the back tension stable and improves the head touch of the tape. In addition, the reel motor allows the tape to be wound at a constant speed without damaging the tape during fast forward.<br>The 3-motor system is electrically controlled using microswitches, relays, and solenoids. In addition, each motor is made of oilless metal with less wear, and has a long maintenance circle with excellent durability.<br><br>Along with a high-performance ferrite erasing head, it uses an efficient core material and a push-pull type oscillation circuit with a margin using Litz wire, making it possible to operate stably even when tapes with deeper bias than general 150 (JIS) tapes are used.<br>In addition, when used with one channel, the load fluctuation of the oscillation transformer is small and recording with margin is possible. Moreover, since the bias frequency is high at 100 kHz, there is no need to worry about beat.<br><br>Equipped with a bias switching mechanism, recording utilizing the performance of low-noise tape is possible.<br><br>It is equipped with a simultaneous monitoring function to switch between program source and playback sound from recorded tape during recording.<br>The VU motor is linked with a monitor switch to indicate the input level and the playback level.<br><br>Since the volume of the line and microphone is independent, mixing recording is possible.<br><br>Equipped with the height adjustment mechanism of the reel base, the height can be adjusted by turning the shaft of the reel base left and right using a Phillips screwdriver.<br><br>Equipped with a VU meter.<br><br>It has a special amplifier for headphones.<br><br>Hard stainless steel is used for guide post.<br>The mechanical filter, which combines the guide post and the tension arm, absorbs vibration even if the tape is not easily separated from the reel or if the tape is unstably wound and fed, so that stable tape travel can be obtained.<br><br>It uses a brake mechanism with built-in tape protection measures. The brake drum, which combines epoxy resin and special felt, has excellent balance accuracy and durability to prevent imbalance due to aging and protect the tape with smooth movement.<br><br>The motors, solenoids, and enamel resistors, which generate heat, are structured to prevent temperature rises. Each motor is equipped with a dedicated fan with high blowing efficiency.<br><br>With the tape lifter fixing mechanism that uses both spring and plate spring, the lifter is completely separated from the head surface and fixed, so no unpleasant sound occurs during fast forward.<br><br>It uses a 5 mm thick aluminum top panel and a reinforced die-cast frame on the side to increase the strength.<br><br>Equipped with Rec. Pause mechanism.<br>In this mechanism, before recording, you set the control lever to the pause position and press the record button and arrow button to start recording immediately in Play mode. When you pause the control lever during recording, the recording amplifier stays on and the tape stops temporarily. When you switch to Play mode, recording starts again.<br><br>Adjustment of the crimping of the brake and replacement of various parts can be done simply by removing the back cover.<br>The various adjustment volumes of the amplifier (recording and playback equalizer, recording and playback level meter, recording and playback bias adjustment) are also integrated in one place, and can be adjusted while the tape is running.<br><br>Equipped with an automatic stop mechanism. When the tape is rewound, the shut-off lever operates and the mechanism stops automatically.<br><br>Equipped with a 4-digit index counter.<br><br>Compatible with both horizontal and vertical installation.<br><br>Stainless steel panel is adopted.<br><br>There were 2 types, the normal model A-2300 and the black face A-2300BLACK.</p>
