				<p class="detail">A top-loading CD player.<br><br>The D-500X&#39;s uses a front loading system that eliminates unstable structures such as trays, and the recess for disk ejection is designed to prevent turbulence, thereby eliminating the cause of unnecessary vibration from the root.<br>In addition, the entire loading section has a floating structure and is attached to a strong base to provide a mechanism that is extremely resistant to external vibration. By taking measures against such vibration, tracing performance has been dramatically improved.<br><br>The Philips CDM-3 mechanism is used as the pickup mechanism.<br>This pickup is a die-cast swing arm with a clear fulcrum. The pantograph shape of the arm has a focus mechanism mounted on the die-cast frame that always traces perpendicular to the disk. The single-beam system eliminates the influence of the side-beam and ensures excellent optical performance.<br><br>A resistor ladder type DAC is used for the D/A conversion part.<br>The high-precision DAC and 4-times over-sampling enable a low-gradient output waveform, which is processed only by a natural low-order analog filter, making it possible to play music without distortion.<br><br>The power supply is equipped with a 100 VA class powerful power transformer, and the Line 5 windings of the DAC analog amplifier, decoder, operation, display and accessory sections are separated to provide a completely independent power supply with independent regulators for each section.<br>In particular, the power supply for the analog section is thoroughly cleaned by applying an electrostatic shield to the winding inside the transformer.<br><br>The chassis is designed to be completely non-resonant and vibration-free.<br>First of all, the overall structure is wedge-shaped to eliminate natural vibration and torsion, ensuring extremely high stability against various external vibration modes. In addition, the main mechanism section has excellent rigidity and vibration resistance, such as reinforced glass fiber reinforced plastic, heavy-weight aluminum top panel, and sidewood, and resonance and vibration are suppressed by using materials with different vibration modes.<br>In addition, the internal structure is designed to achieve high rigidity, non-resonance and non-vibration by combining a double-bottom plate design in which the mechanism part, power supply part and signal system are divided and a thick top panel.<br><br>The front panel has a simple layout of the minimum necessary keys, which is combined with a multi-functional wireless remote control to improve operability.<br>Each key has its own unique face full touch, providing a light touch but a sharp and reliable switching feeling.<br><br>FTS is used for the program function. Once a program is stored, it can be recalled as many times as necessary regardless of power ON/OFF. In addition, a total of 137 discs can be stored (one disc can store five songs).<br><br>The volume uses a mechanical electric volume with an emphasis on sound quality.<br>You can check the volume level with the rotary indicator.<br><br>The display system uses FL (fluorescent display tube), which generates less noise.<br>In addition, noise control is provided by an independent power supply dedicated to the display and a ferrite core line filter.<br><br>The output terminal is equipped with one digital output and two fixed / variable analog outputs.<br><br>We use pure focus capacitors, RMA resistors, newly developed original parts such as electrolytic capacitors for sound quality and copper tube containing Styrofoam capacitors, etc. everywhere, and we use 70-micron copper foil circuit boards with extremely low circuit resistance.<br>In addition, thorough measures against vibration have been taken, such as a copper heat sink, a strong mounting base for power transformers, and a thick copper plate on the DAC.<br><br>PC-OCC oxygen-free copper wire is used for the part that affects sound.<br><br>Copper plating is applied to the entire chassis.</p>
