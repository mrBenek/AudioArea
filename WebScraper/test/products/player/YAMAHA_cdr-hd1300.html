				<p class="detail">HDD/CD recorder which can record HDD and edit / create CD-R.<br><br>As an HDD/CD system that can store music in the HDD, you can freely edit and burn CDs.<br>CD-to-HDD stock speeds up to 10 x, and HDD-to-CD recording speeds up to 8 x (4 x fixed for AudioMASTER mode recording).<br><br>A commercially available IDE/ATA type 3.5 inch HDD can be used for the HDD recorder.<br>The disc capacity can be selected from 20 to 137 GB and supports approximately 120 hours of continuous recording when using an 80 GB HDD.<br>It is equipped with functions such as long play like BGM, bookmark your favorite songs and listen to them all together, and create an album in the HDD. By creating an album in the HDD beforehand, you can create a personal CD without failure.<br><br>Both the HDD recorder and CD recorder use the same uncompressed linear PCM process as CD. This makes it possible to record and edit high-quality sound without data loss like MD and MP3.<br>In addition, the A/D converter and D/A converter are equipped with a high-precision 24-bit type based on pure audio standards.<br><br>Equipped with AudioMASTER, Yamaha&#39;s original high-quality sound recording technology.<br>With this function, it is possible to increase the bit length by using the recording area of the bit length and improve the signal quality. By increasing the linear speed during CD playback by approximately 17% from the conventional 1.2m/s to 1.4m/s, the dispersion of the recorded signal is relatively absorbed and jitter is reduced, making it possible to record high-quality discs at the CD master level.<br>CD-Rs recorded in AudioMASTER can be played by ordinary CD players, and the wide range of data recorded is easy to read, making it highly storable.<br>* Only unrecorded CD-Rs with a recording time of 74 minutes or 80 minutes are available for AudioMASTER recording. Recording time is approximately 63 minutes for 74 minutes disc and approximately 68 minutes for 79 minutes disc. AudioMASTER recording to CD-RW and partially recorded CD-Rs is not possible. In addition, it is necessary to stock CD-Rs in HDD once to record AudioMASTER.<br><br>Equipped with analog input, analog source such as cassette can be stored in HDD after A/D conversion.<br><br>It has a duplicate function and allows you to duplicate CDs.<br>If you copy data from a commercially available, copyright-protected digital sound source such as a music CD to an HDD and then copy it to a CD-R/RW, the data is considered to have been moved to a CD-R/RW and is deleted from the HDD. Therefore, it is not possible to copy data from one HDD to another CD-R/RW.<br><br>Equipped with 2 types of digital level adjustment function.<br>The digital input level adjustment function allows you to adjust the recording level from the built-in CD or external device to the HDD within a range of -12 to + 12 dB (in 0.4 dB steps).<br>The track level adjustment function allows you to adjust the volume difference between tracks in an album created on the HDD within a range of -12 to + 12 dB (0.4 dB steps).<br>You cannot AudioMASTER record a track-level-adjusted album onto a CD-R.<br><br>Songs stored on the HDD can be edited with high precision in units of one frame (1/75 second), which was impossible with conventional CD recorders.<br>In addition, CD TEXT data recorded on an audio CD can be simultaneously copied to the HDD or new data can be input to the HDD.<br><br>Equipped with a timer recording function, you can record the program you want to listen to while you are away by combining with an audio timer.<br><br>Equipped with an S-video / RCA composite video output terminal, you can display a list of HDD information (groups / tracks) to be played back by connecting to a TV or monitor, and a list of various settings for copying and recording.<br><br>Equipped with RS-232C terminal for connection with PC.<br>By connecting to a PC and using a dedicated application, you can easily enter the title.<br><br>Equipped with 8 x (CD-R) and 4 x (CD-RW) high-speed finalization functions.<br>In addition, 4 x speed erasing of CD-RW is possible.<br><br>Yamaha&#39;s original high-speed, high-sound CD-R drives are used.<br><br>Uses Yamaha&#39;s original CD-R/HDD control.<br><br>Equipped with a digital fade in / out function.<br><br>Equipped with a headphone port with volume.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
