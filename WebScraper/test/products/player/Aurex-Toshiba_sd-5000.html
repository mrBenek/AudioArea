				<p class="detail">A flagship DVD video / audio player that supports both DVD video and DVD audio.<br><br>Two discs can be set in the SD 5000.<br><br><strong>Video part</strong><br><br>The video DAC uses a high-performance 10-bit / 54 MHz video D/A converter.<br>By drastically increasing the processing speed of the video DAC from 10-bit / 27-MHz to 54 MHz, it is possible to perform high-speed arithmetic processing with more latitude. In addition, signal degradation is minimized because 8-bit data is converted to 10-bit data before processing.<br><br>Equipped with an independently developed high-resolution progressive video circuit capable of obtaining a horizontal resolution of 540 lines even in the progressive video system.<br>Conventional progressive signal conversion circuits (10-bit / 27-MHz) have caused information loss and noise contamination in video signals due to their structure. However, with the high-speed processing capability of 10-bit / 54 MHz, this circuit realizes over-sampling processing of progressive signals and enables digital filtering of progressive signals, which previously relied only on analog filters. This minimizes noise levels and realizes video signal conversion without information loss.<br><br>It uses a real theater mode progressive conversion circuit that enables film-like smooth image reproduction.<br>Conventional circuits normally perform 3-2 pull-down processing (telecine conversion) when playing back video software for DVDs recorded at 24 frames per second, resulting in overlapping fields and jagged outlines of moving subjects.<br>In the Real Theater Mode Progressive Conversion Circuit, 24-frame video is converted as it is into 60-frame video at double speed, so that no field overlap due to telecine conversion occurs and natural and smooth video reproduction is realized.<br><br>The video encoder with built-in super sub alias filter, which enables horizontal resolution of 540 lines, is further upgraded.<br>In the circuit installed this time, the calculation capability is doubled by changing the digital filter from 27 MHz operation to 54 MHz operation, and by realizing 4 times over sampling, higher quality reproduction is possible.<br><br>DNR circuit is mounted.<br><br>Each of the interlaced and progressive methods provides detailed image quality control.<br><br>D2 video output terminal and component video output terminal are mounted.<br><br>It is equipped with a bit rate indicator display function which can confirm the change of transfer data volume on the screen.<br>When video data is compressed and recorded on a DVD using MPEG2, a variable transfer rate technology is used to allocate the amount of data according to changes in the image state. With this function, when a DVD is played back, a rough indication of the amount of data transferred for each image can be displayed on the screen using numbers and a level bar.<br><br>Equipped with high-quality letterbox conversion circuit.<br>When you play a 16 : 9 DVD video on a 4 : 3 TV, a letterbox conversion is performed to convert the original video, which consists of 480 effective lines, to 360 lines (360 lines) without the Kuroobi portion.<br>This conversion circuit uses a 4-tap vertical filter developed in-house. It calculates four original scanning lines at high speed and generates new lines with uniform characteristics. As a result, higher quality images can be reproduced than the conventional letterbox image quality.<br><br>It is equipped with an optimum servo that realizes stable playback by adapting to the disc condition.<br><br>Auto Pause Mode automatically controls the still image display according to the state.<br><br>The S-Video output is mounted.<br><br><strong>Audio part</strong><br><br>The D/A converter uses a high-performance audio DAC for the front two channels developed jointly with Analog Devices, Inc. of the United States, which is an improvement over the conventional Advanced Multi-bit Delta-Sigma DAC.<br>A multi-bit system with high jitter tolerance and low noise is combined with a 1-bit system with excellent linearity and no 0 cross distortion. The increase of differential linearity error is reduced by an advanced error averaging circuit between elements.<br><br>It has a built-in Dolby Digital 5.1 ch decoder and DTS decoder.<br><br>Equipped with an HDCD decoder.<br><br>Equipped with the Specializer N-2-2 Digital Virtual Surround System, which can reproduce powerful three dimensional sound images with 2 speakers.<br><br><strong>Other</strong><br><br>It is equipped with a V-Remote function that can be operated using a virtual remote control displayed on the TV screen. This function allows you to control the playback speed and direction, and to select your favorite audio / subtitle / angle.<br><br>Equipped with a GUI function, you can perform initial settings such as image, sound and screen display while viewing the screen.<br><br>It is equipped with the QUICK function. If you press the QUICK button on the remote control while the disc is being played, you can display a list of playback mode menus on the screen. From this menu, you can switch between memory playback, repeat playback, random playback, bit rate display and text display ON/OFF, etc.<br><br>Equipped with NAVI function.<br>When you press the NAVI button on the remote control, the NAVI screen which displays icons of each function and disk information on the screen starts up. You can move to the execution screen of each function just by selecting the icon.<br><br>With the built-in zoom function, you can enlarge the center of the screen up to approximately 3.5 times by pressing the zoom button on the remote control during playback. You can also reduce the screen so that the edge of the screen is not chipped, and you can move the part you want by the remote control up, down, left or right to zoom in on still images.<br><br>Equipped with an auto power off function, the power is automatically turned off when playback stops or screen saver operation continues for approximately 20 minutes.<br><br>Equipped with a screen saver function, when playing DVD video, the screen saver automatically activates when the still image lasts for a long time depending on the pose state to prevent the screen from burning.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
