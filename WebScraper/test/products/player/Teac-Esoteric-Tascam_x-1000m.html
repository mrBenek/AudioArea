				<p class="detail">This master recorder combines advanced technologies such as the dbx noise reduction system, closed-loop dual capstan mechanism, EE tape support, and 2-track 38 cm speed.<br><br>It is equipped with a noise reduction system dbx which was developed as equipment for recording studios.<br>Dbx consists of precise electronic circuits that compress the original sound to 1 / 2 decibel (decibel) during recording and expand the sound level by 2 times during playback to restore it to its original state. This makes it possible to record sound that exceeds the allowable dynamic range of tape with plenty of room.<br>The dbx achieves an excellent dynamic range while at the same time reducing the noise level by 30 to 40 dB in the entire audible frequency band by accurately detecting the effective value of the complex signal of each sound.<br><br>It is equipped with C. E. S. (Computational Edit System) which is an accurate editing mechanism by microcomputer.<br>Equipped with a 5-digit LED linear counter that operates regularly with the rotation of the フーテージローラー every second. This realizes the total recording time, accurate time measurement of songs, second setting of auto spacer (no signal part), timing control at the start of recording, program counter function, etc.<br>In addition, it is equipped with S. T. Z. (Search To 0) which returns to the counter 0 display from anywhere on the tape, and S. T. C. (Search To Cue) button which returns to the position where the CUE button is pressed.<br>It is equipped with Dupli Sync which can dub to cassette in synchronization.<br><br>The mechanism uses a closed-loop dual capstan system in which two pairs of capstan and pinch rollers drive the tape, and the erasing head is installed outside the capstan shaft capstan shaft to shorten the tape span.<br>In addition, Diac&#39;s original tension servo system, which can obtain constant tape tension at all times, can obtain uniform tension in the loop from the beginning to the end of winding, greatly reducing modulation noise and flutter components.<br><br>The tape selector is equipped with an EE tape compatible position.<br>Magnetic materials for high-density recording (epitaxial, abilin, etc.) are used for EE tapes to improve high-frequency characteristics. For positions compatible with EE tapes, recording bias and playback equalizer are set to improve frequency characteristics, expand dynamic range, and reduce noise level.<br>In addition, the head amplifier and oscillator systems have been improved to support EE tapes, and the quality has been improved.<br><br>A versatile 4-track playback head is built in.<br><br>Equipped with a left / right independent recording mode switch and monitor switch.<br><br>It is equipped with a real-time pose in which the rise from the recorded pose is smooth.<br><br>The front panel is 5 mm thick.<br><br>Equipped with Rec Mute and Auto Spacer functions that allow free white space between songs.<br><br>Equipped with pitch control that works for both recording and playback (± 6% approx. half tone)<br><br>It is equipped with a playback pause mechanism that allows for accurate cue and a cue mechanism that is convenient for finding necessary songs.<br><br>Uses a high hardness permalloy head.</p>
