				<p class="detail">In addition to the know-how obtained with the PX-1, cost and stability have been improved to enhance the player system with a linear tracking system.<br><br>The advantages of the linear tracking arm are that horizontal tracking error is less and harmonic distortion is less in principle, no inside force is generated in principle, and dynamic lateral balance can be obtained by the symmetrical structure straight arm.<br><br>In order to improve the accuracy of the mechanism for moving the arm, which is a problem with linear tracking arm, a tracking error sensor is mounted.<br>The tracking error sensor has a structure in which a shutter with a slit is attached to the vertical center axis of the arm, a dual CDs is placed above the shutter, and an LED is placed below the shutter. When the arm deviates from a right angle, an unbalanced voltage is generated in the CDs. Since this photosensor is non-contact type, the sensitivity of the arm does not deteriorate.<br>The unbalanced voltage generated in the CDs is amplified and sent to a DC coreless servo motor for driving the arm base. The rotation is decelerated by a pulley to drive the drive belt attached to the arm base.<br>In addition, a dead zone is provided to cope with the eccentricity of the record, and the effect of the eccentricity is suppressed by utilizing the fact that the feed of the sound groove is always inward. Specifically, the servo circuit starts operating with a deviation of ± 0.5 mm from the offset position of the needle tip and ± 0.15 ° from the tracking error angle, and does not operate below this value.<br>The linear tracking servo operates only when the arm is down. When the arm is up, the linear tracking servo is controlled by the left and right feed signals.<br><br>The servo motor for the arm drive is a coreless motor with high torque and low vibration and mechanical noise. In addition, to reduce the rotational noise and vibration of the motor, it is wrapped in neoprene rubber and suspended from the rear base by butyl rubber with good vibration absorption.<br>A rubber belt transmits rotational torque from the motor to the arm base drive belt, and three plastic controllers with a good S / N ratio support the smooth surface of the rear base to prevent vibration when the arm base moves from side to side on the rear base, thereby suppressing vibration caused by rolling.<br><br>The PX-2 straight arm adopts a sliding weight method in which a counter weight for applying needle pressure is slid before and after mounting on the arm shaft. This method makes needle pressure adjustment easier and more accurate than the conventional Lee Ka-eun Tarring method.<br>A short arm with an effective length of 190 mm is used for the arm. By using a rectangular and horizontally long balance weight and a shell or pipe made of highly rigid material, the arm has a high rigidity with an optimum equivalent mass. This reduces resonance in the mid-frequency range, and the arm resonance is around 12 Hz, making the arm less susceptible to record warping and eccentricity.<br><br>The head shell adopts a lightweight and small head shell made by molding pure aluminum blocks exclusively for audio with a high-pressure hydraulic press machine, and has a symmetrical structure without finger hooks.<br><br>The base of the linear tracking arm is equipped with a height adjustment mechanism of ± 4 mm stroke, and it is compatible with various cartridges.<br><br>The rotary system uses a coreless Hall motor with a large starting torque and no torque fluctuation, a turntable with a large moment of inertia, and double servo FG + quartz PLL.<br>The rotation speed is detected by a frequency generator (FG) that generates a frequency proportional to the rotation of the turntable. This method uses a coil to detect a pattern magnetized by a magnet that rotates together with the rotor. This pattern and coil are arranged around the entire circumference of the motor. This is an all-round integration type. As a result, the detected waveform is averaged around the entire circumference, and accuracy is improved without being affected by the eccentricity of the detector itself error of magnetization pattern.<br>The signal detected by this FG is compared in phase (quartz-locked PLL) with the reference signal of a high-precision crystal oscillator with a pitch accuracy of 20 ppm. Positive torque is applied to the motor during acceleration, and negative torque is applied to the motor during deceleration. Stability is improved by using both positive and negative servo.<br>When steady rotation is reached, the indicator that quartz lock has been achieved lights up.<br>The Coreless Hall motor adopted in the motor is a newly developed DC4-phase 8-pole coreless motor with no iron core in the stator winding and no gap (slot) between the iron core and the iron core. It has very little cogging (partial torque unevenness of magnetic attraction force), and the starting torque, which is a problem with coreless motors, is as large as 1 kg ・ cm.<br>The turntable is made of acoustic die-cast aluminum 31 cm in diameter and has a moment of inertia of 270 kg ・ cm.<sup>2</sup>For more information.<br><br>The PX-2 is equipped with a full automatic control function using a servo circuit that operates the arm. It achieves smooth operability by balancing a full automatic mechanism using a newly developed logic IC and a manual mechanism that has been carefully examined from an ergonomics perspective.<br><br>The power supply section uses a constant voltage (24 v) power supply with a current margin of approximately 2.5 times that of the constant current of approximately 400 ma.<br><br>The cabinet is the same as the PX-1. It uses 5 mm thick acoustic aluminum die-cast, and is designed to be vibration-proof and heavy.<br>In addition, a composite type of spring and rubber is adopted for the insulator.<br><br>The dust cover is made of acrylic resin with a thickness of 5 mm, which is resistant to howling, and weighs 1.3 kg.</p>
