				<p class="detail">A CD-player with two third generation Mash.<br><br>In order to convert digital signals read from CDs into analog signals more faithfully, we have adopted a unique D/A converter system that operates in complimentary service mode with two 3rd generation Mash installed. This system doubles the resolution of the PWM output as a 1-bit 8-DAC twin balance system. We have succeeded in improving the S / N ratio by eliminating in-phase noise and thoroughly improving the distortion in the high frequency range.<br>In addition, the digital signal is instantly balanced into a 1-bit signal and the analog signal is directly output. This eliminates in principle the generation of 0 cross distortion and non-linear distortion that occur in multi-bit systems, and achieves excellent reproduction capability in minute level signals.<br><br>In order to prevent degradation of sound quality due to interference between the microcomputer, DAC, drive system, display, analog system, etc., the power supply employs a multi-power system with 12 independent power supplies. In addition, an electrolytic capacitor using low-magnification aluminum foil and a large-capacity transformer have been newly developed to realize a power supply with superior linearity over a wide band.<br><br>The center mechanism layout is adopted, and the drive system is placed in the center of the body, and vibration and resonance during driving are reduced by balancing the weight of the mechanism.<br>In addition, the disk tray is made of liquid crystal polymer with excellent vibration absorption characteristics. In addition, a double chassis structure consisting of an outer chassis and an inner chassis, and a die-cast-base rail holder are also adopted to improve stability and rigidity.<br><br>A linear motor is used to rotate the disk, and it is composed of four motors including a spindle motor and two independent motors for tray loading and mechanical chassis up.<br>In addition, a triple chassis mechanism has been introduced in which the play chassis floats in four places from the mechanical chassis and sub-chassis using a spring and an oil dump. In addition, a 2-axis sliding type pickup has been adopted to prevent vibration.<br><br>In the servo system, we have developed a balance servo system and a balance low-pass filter using our proprietary balance technology. This improves the performance of the circuit and prevents leakage current from entering the audio circuit through the ground. It also balances the output of the D/A converter and blocks the path through which high-frequency components, which affect sound quality, enter the ground.<br>In addition, the NEW Dynamic Servo System, which cancels the crossover distortion of the servo drive amplifier, improves the data reading accuracy.<br><br>For the parts that affect sound quality, quality and compatibility are thoroughly verified, and parts such as Sumimic condenser, Sa film condenser, Styrol condenser and RMG gold plated resistor are used.<br><br>Equipped with a remote controlled digital attenuator, the volume can be adjusted from 0 dB to -26dB while suppressing sound quality degradation.<br><br>Equipped with an auto fader that can fade out music to silence (- ∞ dB) while listening, or fade in music from silence to the set volume level.<br>The fade time can be set in 1-second intervals from 2 seconds to 10 seconds.<br><br>It is equipped with a peak search that detects the peak point of the disk, displays the level, and plays for 5 seconds.<br><br>Equipped with digital optical output.<br><br>Uses a display with ON/OFF function.<br><br>It is equipped with functions such as Play mode (Cont. / Prog. / Rand. / Edit), Side A/B, Sync., Auto Space / Auto Pause, memory to follow, Music Scan, 3-way repeat, 20-track music calendar, etc.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
