				<p class="detail">A magazine-type CD player with a newly developed high-speed newly developed high-speed pulse flow D/A converter.<br><br>The D/A converter is equipped with a high-speed pulse flow D/A converter originally developed by Pioneer. The noise shaper performs an extremely high oversampling of 384 fs and moves the noise components to higher frequencies. At the same time, the out-of-band noise is suppressed by lowering the order of the noise shaper.<br>In addition, since jitter easily occurs at high oscillation frequencies, the master clock is operated at a low clock frequency of 16.93 MHz to obtain stable signal reproduction with little jitter effect.<br>In addition, the new 1bitD/A converter achieves 100% duty output, while the conventional 1bitD/A converter achieves 50% duty output. This doubles the output level and provides audio output with excellent SN ratio and distortion factor.<br><br>The D/A converter consists of two packages, one for the left and one for the right, and the other for the complementary application.<br>In this method, two input normal data and input inverted data are handled per package, and their outputs are added differentially. This cancels harmonic distortion in the operational amplifier output and realizes low distortion factor.<br><br>It is equipped with new multi-memory, and by storing program and delete information, it is possible to reproduce up to 20 magazines of the program and delete stored last time regardless of power ON / OFF or magazine loading / unloading.<br>In addition, it is equipped with a music memory that allows easy storage of music genres. Nine types of music types are pre-stored in memory. You can store a genre name by simply selecting it with the key. You can also enter numbers from 1 to 9 at the end of the genre name.<br><br>Equipped with an ADLC (Automatic Digital Level Controller), the microcomputer samples digital data in real time and controls the digital attenuator level relative to the reference level so that the sound volume level can always be maintained at an appropriate level.<br><br>It is equipped with a highlight scan. Unlike the usual introscan, this function plays a song from 1 minute after the start of the song for 10 seconds, so you can check the song more smoothly.<br>In addition, it is equipped with a magazine highlight scan, and it is possible to highlight scan the first song of each disc sequentially.<br>Each each key to toggle between highlight scan and disk scan.<br><br>The semi-center mechanism, which is laid out along the signal flow, realizes more pure sound quality.<br><br>The audio circuit uses a class-A FET buffer amplifier to reduce the load on each stage and to lower the output impedance of the amplifier as a whole. This reduces the influence of capacitance components such as low-pass filters that become the load on the amplifier.<br>Class A operation reduces the fluctuation of power consumption during operation and realizes a low distortion factor.<br><br>The power transformer is equipped with separate twin transformers for digital / servo circuits and analog circuits.<br>Especially for analog applications, a dedicated DAC winding is provided for bifilar winding.<br><br>Rigidity and dimensional accuracy are improved by newly developed silent multi-mechanism which adopted monocoque structure for chassis.<br>In addition, the mechanical noise generated when the disc is changed has been reduced by improving the mechanism and part materials.<br><br>In order to prevent interference and noise from the digital / servo circuit boards, a dedicated circuit board is used for analog circuits. In addition, a shield box is used to separate digital circuits from digital circuits.<br><br>The chassis uses a honeycomb chassis.<br><br>Equipped with a CD-DECK sync terminal that allows one touch tape editing, Pioneer&#39;s cassette deck with the CD-DECK sync mark allows easy tape editing.<br><br>Equipped with a power on start function that enables timer start.<br><br>Equipped with a headphone port with volume.<br><br>It comes with a 10-key wireless remote control that allows you to turn the power on/off and adjust the volume at hand.</p>
