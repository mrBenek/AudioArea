				<p class="detail">The DAT transport was developed to be the world&#39;s best digital audio recorder.<br><br>The mechanism part adopts the next-generation DAT mechanism FAST.<br>This mechanism employs a quick-loading arm, which provides ideal control of arm speed and force by means of a unique special link arm similar to human joint movement and an interactive microprocessor. This protects the tape while achieving an amazing loading speed of more than twice that of conventional devices.<br>In addition, with conventional DAT, the tape is always wound around the head even when it is fast-forwarded or rewound, so not only does the quick winding speed slow down, but it also places a heavy burden on the tape itself. To solve this problem, FAST uses a simple tape path structure to set a half-load position. When the FF or REW button is pressed twice in succession, the tape is set to a state completely separated from the head, and quick winding starts immediately at an average speed of 400 x. When quick winding starts, the speed is gradually accelerated at the beginning to reach approximately 600 x speed near the center of the tape, and when the tape is close to the end, it decelerates to approximately 150 x speed or less. When the leader tape at the end of the tape is detected, the tape is completely stopped by braking controlled by the reel motor. This method shortens the quick winding time from 45 to 60 seconds for 120 minutes tape to approximately 19 to 23 seconds. In addition, since only the guide roller is in contact with the tape in the half-load state, there is almost no burden on the tape.<br><br>Most DAT mechanisms based on conventional VTR technology rely only on a pair of movable tape guides that move with each loading to control the alignment of the tape with respect to the rotating head (lateral tilt / height / forward / backward tilt). Therefore, accuracy is not achieved, and the amount of error correction increases, resulting in poor sound quality. The Nakamichi1000 uses a unique stationary tape guide to solve this problem.<br>The stationary tape guide is fixed on the opposite side of the tape from the conventional movable guide. The four built-in guides always provide accurate alignment to the tape just by pressing the tape. It is also made of graphite engineering plastic, which is highly accurate, slippery and abrasion resistant. The tape alignment is guaranteed to the micron order accuracy without requiring difficult adjustment or maintenance.<br><br>FAST also pursues the quietness of tape travel and uses traditional Nakamichi technology to achieve extremely quiet operation.<br>First of all, we have greatly reduced the tape tapping sound caused by the rotating head by making a unique design of the head shape. Second, we effectively absorb the surface vibration of the tape by taking advantage of the large internal loss of the stationary tape guide fixed to the left and right sides of the head drum. In addition, unnecessary resonance is completely damped by a high-rigidity chassis without a notch hole for the loading arm and a heavy weight head block made of die-cast, so that the tape running sound is suppressed to a level that is almost inaudible.<br><br>The head section is a 4-head system with two dedicated high-precision recording and playback heads arranged at 90 ゜お each.<br>In addition, the development of an ultrahigh-speed digital muting network that effectively blocks noise when switching between tape and source has enabled smooth after-monitoring like analog, which was difficult with conventional digital recorders.<br><br>It is equipped with a display window showing the movement of the cassette tape and loading arm, and accurate recording is possible while confirming the actual movement.<br><br>A plug-in unit system is adopted in which most parts other than the case, power supply part and operation part can be replaced.<br><br>Equipped with an absolute time system, you can use a variety of tape play functions unique to DAT.<br><br>The power supply section uses the highest grade toroidal transformer.<br>It also uses a large capacity multi-power supply with a discrete regulator.<br><br>It adopts a resonance braking structure combining a heavy aluminum shell and a copper plated chassis.<br><br>Uses a full static indicator that does not worry about noise generation.<br><br>Equipped with a 2-speed digital auto-fader.<br><br>It supports subcode functions such as absolute time search, program search, counter search, auto - manual start ID, skip ID, rehearsal function, end mark function, program number, program renumber, program memory, etc.<br><br>Equipped with a 4-mode tape counter that can display counter, absolute time, リメイニングタイム and program time.<br><br>Equipped with a timer standby function.<br><br>Direct play is possible.<br><br>Equipped with tape end repeat, end mark repeat and program repeat functions.<br><br>Equipped with auto rewind and rewind auto play function.<br><br>It is equipped with remote input / output terminal which realizes synchronous operation by multiple 1000.<br><br>Contains coaxial and optical digital input / output terminals.<br><br>Equipped with tape compartment illumination.<br><br>Two optical (single crystal quartz fiber) and two coaxial (LC-OFC Class 1) digital cables are included.<br><br>Comes with an aluminum window panel for replacement.<br><br>Remote Controller 1000r is included.<br>The 1000r has the same layout as the operation panel of the Nakamichi1000, and eliminates the sense of discomfort in remote operation. In addition, the 1000r has most of the functions of the 1000 and can operate up to two 1000 independently.<br>Plus, when you order, you can choose between wired and wireless depending on what you&#39;re using.<br><br>There was a 1000 Professional (business model) with the exact same contents except for some specifications.</p>
