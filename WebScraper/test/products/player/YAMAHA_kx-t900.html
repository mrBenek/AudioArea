				<p class="detail">Twin reverse cassette deck equipped with Dolby B / C NR and Dolby HX Pro.<br><br>As it is a completely independent twin reverse deck, it can be used as two independent decks, or can be operated such as relay recording and dubbing linked to deck 1/2.<br><br>Dolby HX Pro is installed separately on each deck 1/2.<br>The Dolby HX Pro automatically adjusts the bias amount to match the high-level strength of the recording signal, enabling optimum tape recording regardless of the type of tape or whether noise reduction is turned on or off.<br><br>In the noise reduction system, Dolby B/C NR is mounted on each deck 1/2 independently.<br>As a result, both decks can be used separately even when they are used simultaneously. In addition, when editing dubbing, cross-dolby dubbing, in which tapes recorded in Dolby C are edited in Dolby B, is possible.<br><br>The bias frequency is 210 kHz high bias, twice the conventional 105 kHz.<br>As a result, the bias is sufficiently separated from the audio signal to reduce the beat distortion and intermodulation noise caused by interference between the signals, and to eliminate the effect of sampling frequency, which is a problem during CD dubbing.<br>In double-speed dubbing, the audio signal has twice the pitch, but the high-bias allows recording with good dynamic range and frequency characteristics.<br><br>Dubbing editing from deck 2 to deck 1 is possible.<br>In full-auto dubbing, the A side and B side of the cassette are aligned and the same content is dubbed. In skip-dubbing, the unrecorded portion for more than 15 seconds is shortened and dubbed. In random-program dubbing, you can dub your favorite songs in the order you like. In manual dubbing, you can dub while editing with rec pause or mute.<br>In addition to these dubbing edits, you can select two speeds, constant speed and double speed.<br><br>You can play 15 songs in random program. With this function, you can mix and play the songs of each deck 1/2.<br>In addition, the reverse mode is independent for each deck 1 and 2, and you can choose 3 modes such as one way, one round trip and eight round trip.<br><br>The head uses an amorphous 12-sheet laminated head with low magnetic loss to improve the current efficiency and obtain excellent sound quality. The head winding uses LC-OFC (linear crystalline oxygen-free copper) with very low signal loss to further improve sound quality.<br><br>By using the 10 keys, you can directly select up to 99 songs before and after.<br><br>Equipped with an intro-scan function that plays the beginning of a song for about 14 seconds one after another.<br><br>Equipped with a linear counter with tape length switching function.<br>With a built-in microcomputer, the running time can be displayed with high precision according to the length of the tape, and the reproducing time can also be displayed at the time of rerecording.<br><br>With the built-in blank skip function, if the unrecorded portion lasts for more than 15 seconds, you can automatically send and play the next song.<br><br>By combining with an external timer, it is possible to record the absence and play the alarm clock.<br><br>There are 2 color variations, titanium and black.<br>It also comes with a wireless remote control for each color.</p>
