				<p class="detail">A CD player with wide-band playback using the Legato link conversion S.<br><br>Based on the originally developed Legato link conversion, it is equipped with Legato link conversion S which is further improved.<br>In the Legato Link Conversion, the waveform of the original signal was estimated based on the data on the CD, and the components at 20 kHz or higher based on the 1/f attenuation characteristics were reproduced. In the Legato Link Conversion S, an independent harmonic generation circuit was added for overtones. Based on the attenuation characteristics estimated for the original sound, the components at 20 kHz or higher generate the overtones faithful to the fundamental sound. The reproduction band is expanded to 50 kHz by adding them together with the time axis, and unnecessary ringing is further enhanced.<br><br>A turntable mechanism is adopted for the mechanism part.<br>By moving the pickup and spindle motor from the bottom of the disk to the top, the disk is supported from the bottom to the whole surface. The moment of inertia is approximately three times higher than that of the conventional tray system, and unnecessary vibration of the disk, which causes deterioration of servo characteristics and jitter, is reduced.<br><br>The D/A converter is equipped with an originally developed 1-bit high-speed pulse flow D/A converter.<br>In principle, the 1-bit method does not cause 0 cross distortion or glitch noise, but there is a problem of requantization noise during bit compression. In high-speed pulse-flow D/A converters, the noise shaper operates at a high oversampling frequency of 384 fs to reduce the noise floor due to requantization. As a result, the noise shaper can be used in second and lower orders, reducing the effects of out-of-band noise and analog low-pass filters.<br>In addition, the master clock is operated at a low frequency of 16.93 mhz to reduce the effect of jitter.<br><br>For pure signal transmission, it uses direct construction to minimize the signal path from the pickup to the output terminal. In addition to the center tray design, digital &amp; servo and audio boards are separated to prevent interference.<br>In addition, the audio circuit board is a sealed PCB (double-sided board) to prevent noise from jumping from the digital system to the analog system. In addition, the analog circuit board uses OFC (oxygen-free copper) for the copper foil part, and is connected at the same time with the shortest distance to form a symmetrical structure.<br><br>A clean laser pickup developed in-house is used in the pickup section.<br>Power loss is reduced by reducing the number of optical components such as collimator lenses. Moreover, by reducing aberration in the optical path, laser efficiency is improved and signal readout with low distortion is realized.<br>In addition, a photodetector with built-in I/V head amplifier is adopted, and together with the Accu-Focus system, jitter due to reading error and disturbance is suppressed.<br>In addition, the pickup body uses an engineering plastic body with computer-based strength analysis to achieve high rigidity and high internal loss with no resonance.<br><br>The audio circuit is equipped with a class-A operation FET buffer amplifier. The low-output impedance reduces the influence of the load of the connected amplifier. The class-A operation also reduces the fluctuation of power consumption during operation.<br><br>The spindle motor is equipped with a large brushless hole motor with a starting torque of 65g ・ cm, and combined with a φ 4.5 mm shaft, stable rotational performance is obtained.<br>The pickup is driven by a silent linear motor servo mechanism.<br><br>The newly developed multi-layered honeycomb chassis is based on the conventional BMC (Bulk Molding Compound) honeycomb chassis, and steel plates and cushioning materials with excellent electromagnetic shielding are layered to improve vibration control and prevent reflection from the floor.<br>The silent chassis covers the mechanical part of the turntable. It uses a lamisert mechanical base molded with special resin and a metal of different types is overlaid on the mechanical base. In addition, it has a floating structure with a coaxial suspension made of special rubber and springs. The mechanical part is also vibration-proof.<br>In particular, the mechanical base is copper-plated to reduce magnetic distortion.<br><br>The power supply section is equipped with a twin power transformer with independent digital &amp; servo and analog circuits.<br>In addition, the power supply circuit independently rectifies five parts of digital &amp; servo, servo drive, D/A converter, audio + and - by means of 5-part / 14-regulator to prevent interference between circuits.<br><br>Uses an OFC (high-purity oxygen-free copper) 4-core extra-thick power cord with polarity display with separate core wires for servo / analog only.<br><br>Equipped with a balanced output that is not easily affected by external noise.<br><br>Uses an aluminum extruded top bonnet with excellent vibration control properties.<br><br>It uses an aluminum panel stabilizer that increases rigidity and prevents slight vibration of the front panel.<br><br>It is equipped with a display off switch to prevent scanning noise and cancels scanning noise (for backup).<br><br>Equipped with a digital / anlogout changeover switch (for backup).</p>
