				<p class="detail">This is a stereo cassette deck that has faithfully inherited the high quality of the T-1000S and has been upgraded to every detail.<br>It has the same characteristics and features as the T-1000S, but unlike the T-1000S, it does not have Dolby S.<br><br>It is equipped with Pioneer&#39;s original FLAT SYSTEM bias, sensitivity, and equalizer are adjusted to flatten the frequency characteristics with higher precision.<br>The FLAT SYSTEM compensation position consists of three points : low band (400 Hz), mid-high band (3 kHz), and ultra-high band (15 kHz). Data analysis is performed by a microcomputer with 64 steps of bias and 32 steps of level. The equalizer has 16 steps of mid-high band and 3 steps of ultra-high band resolution. The FLAT SYSTEM automatically adjusts the appropriate numerical value for each tape with high accuracy in a short time.<br>In addition, manual fine adjustment is possible after auto-tuning by the up / down button for bias adjustment.<br><br>Equipped with last memory function to store data of main deck switch position and FLAT SYSTEM.<br>Data such as B. L. E (bias, sensitivity, equalizer) obtained with the FLAT SYSTEM and manually variable bias, as well as ON/OFF switch positions such as Line Straight, Dolby HX PRO, Dolby Noise Reduction, Meter Range, Display Off, etc., and the number of the electronic counter are stored even when the power is OFF. When timer recording is performed, the FLAT SYSTEM can be used for recording.<br><br>The midship mount design is adopted to satisfy the requirements of vibration and resonance free by the thorough high-rigidity structure and the shortest signal path. By dividing the internal structure into three parts by two inner chassis, the rigidity is dramatically improved. Moreover, the circuits for reproduction, recording, control, and bias oscillator are electrically separated to realize a layout that eliminates interference between signals. In particular, the FL display, control circuit, and bias oscillator circuit, which are noise sources for audio signals, are separately laid out on the left side.<br>In addition, with the new direct construction by the midship mount, the head part is placed in the center to simplify and minimize the signal path from recording to playback.<br><br>The mechanism is equipped with the New Slant Z mechanism developed by polishing up the Z mechanism.<br>The entire tape transport section has been designed to be tilted by 10 °. This reduces the load on the capstan bearing, reduces the shaft runout, and stabilizes the rotation. In addition, the angle of 10 ° was determined through repeated experiments and listening. This overcomes the problem of loading only on one side of the tape, and achieves a good balance and smooth running performance.<br>In addition, a new material FG (Fine Grain) metal is used for the capstan bearing on the winding side. The distribution of pores (holes for storing oil) is made uniform by using a new manufacturing method in addition to the conventional oilless metal. This improves surface roughness, reduces bearing loss by approximately 10%, and improves running characteristics.<br>In addition, the head block uses a double structure of zinc die-cast to ensure head touch accuracy and eliminate external vibration.<br>In addition, the capstan shaft has been treated with FS to prevent tape slippage and enable stable running.<br><br>Equipped with digital tension control that controls the winding torque of the tape by microcomputer.<br>While the microcomputer controls the reel motor voltage according to the size of the winding diameter, the tape is wound at the appropriate tape tension, and the wow and flutter at the beginning of winding of the tape, which tends to be unstable, are improved.<br><br>The recording / reproducing head is equipped with a laser amorphous head with excellent electromagnetic conversion characteristics. Furthermore, PC-OCC (single-crystal high-purity oxygen-free copper) is used for the coil winding to eliminate transmission loss at minute signal levels.<br><br>The newly developed is equipped with a newly developed erase head with an erase frequency shifted to 210 kHz.<br>By suppressing beat and cross-modulation distortion caused by interference between the source harmonics and the bias current, recording with less distortion is realized, and the effect of the bias and wrap circuit filter on sound quality is further reduced.<br>In addition, a Sendust guard structure sendust guard structure that greatly reduces the high-frequency self-demagnetization effect of recorded tapes.<br><br>The power supply section uses ± independent bifilar winding and ± independent power supply.<br>The + power supply and - power supply are separated from the secondary winding of the power transformer to the ground pattern, and the reference power supply circuit is also separated into 4 power supply configuration ± power supply circuit to eliminate the influence of external fluctuation of the reference voltage.<br>This greatly reduces the noise component generated inside the power supply circuit, reducing the noise level by more than 10 dB. In addition, the output impedance characteristic, which is an indication of the power supply circuit performance, is less than 1m Ω in the audible band and as low as 30 μ Ω (0.00003 Ω) at 1 kHz.<br>In addition, a condenser for + and - specific body wrap sound and a copper heat sink have been adopted to improve sound quality.<br><br>It is equipped with M. V. I (Motor Vibration Insulator) to prevent the high-order vibration generated by the capstan motor from being transmitted from the chassis etc. to each part and adversely affecting the sound quality.<br>A heavy special reinforced resin motor bracket and an insulator made of non-resilient rubber are installed between the motor and the mechanical chassis to effectively absorb the vibration energy of the motor and prevent vibration to the mechanical part.<br><br>It employs a copper-plated honeycomb chassis and large insulators to diffuse internal and external vibrations in multiple directions and eliminate noise turbidity.<br><br>A high-precision volume unit is used for the recording volume to prevent degradation of sound quality due to phase difference and noise.<br><br>Equipped with a line straight function, the balance volume can be cut and connected to the recording amplifier through the shortest path.<br>In addition, the input volume is placed close to the input terminal and controlled by a brass shaft to minimize wiring distance.<br><br>It is equipped with a peak level calibration function which can easily distort the tape by the instantaneous peak signal and can set an accurate recording level even for digital sources.<br>Once you hold the peak level of the recording source, you can easily set the appropriate level by adjusting the recording volume with the assistance of the microcomputer.<br><br>Equipped with a 17-segment meter with a meter range switching function, it displays -35dB to + 8 dB in normal operation and -7dB to + 8 dB in expanded range mode in 1 dB steps, enabling accurate recording level adjustment.<br><br>It uses an isorated cassette door that blocks external vibration and a cassette stabilizer that suppresses vibration of the half and eliminates sound turbidity.<br><br>It is equipped with functions such as Dolby HX PRO, CD-DECK synchro function, display OFF function to prevent noise generation from the FL display section, 3-mode counter which can be used with tape counter (index), time counter (elapsed time of recording and rerecording) and リメインカウンター, tape return and return play which automatically starts playback after one touch rewind to counter 0000 position, repeat play, autospace REC mute, etc.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
