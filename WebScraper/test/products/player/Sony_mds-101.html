				<p class="detail">MD deck No. 1 announced by SONY.<br>It was developed with the aim of becoming a basic sound recorder with easy-to-understand and easy-to-use operability as the first generation.<br><br>With the AMS button, you can quickly call up and play the songs you want to listen to, and with the 25 keys on the remote control, you can directly select songs with one touch.<br>In addition, you can enjoy program playback, shuffle playback, one song / all songs / A-B repeat playback.<br><br>A 4-mega DRAM is used for the sound jump guard memory.<br>Audio data read from the disc is stored in memory (up to approximately 8 seconds) and sent out. This makes it possible to start the memory with the sound immediately after the pause is released.<br><br>It is equipped with a music calendar that allows you to check the number of tracks recorded on the disc and the station number during performance.<br>Up to 25 songs are displayed with a calendar frame when MD music software is installed, and without a calendar frame when recording mini discs are installed.<br><br>A 12-character FL display is adopted, and messages such as disc name and song title are displayed in alphabet (scroll display for 13 characters or more) on discs in which character information is recorded.<br>In addition, it is equipped with a digital peak meter that can confirm the accurate recording level.<br><br>With a built-in clock in the body, you can automatically record the date of each song by the year, month, day, hour, and minute by adjusting the clock once, and easily check when it was recorded.<br><br>Equipped with the TOC EDIT function, editing functions such as COMBINE, which connects two consecutive tracks into one track, DIVIDE, which divides one track into two tracks, MOVE, which transfers one track to a desired track number, and ERASE, which instantly erases any track.<br>With the DIVIDE edit function, you can adjust the starting position of the track in approximately ± 60 ms steps. With the rehearsal function, you can set the music while listening to your ears to see where the music is divided.<br><br>The MD mechanism is die-cast to achieve high reliability and durability.<br><br>It uses an oversampling 1-bit A / D converter and a hybrid pulse D/A converter.<br><br>Equipped with an optical digital input / output terminal and a microphone input terminal.<br><br>Equipped with an audio bus terminal, it can be easily combined with a system stereo such as Pro Pixie.<br>By simply setting the MD-recorder to the regenerating condition, it is possible to perform auto function in which the input of the amplifier section is automatically switched, auto power on / off in which the power is linked, timer recording and playback.<br><br>It comes with a remote control. In addition to the basic operation, it is equipped with functions such as direct channel selection by 25 keys and recording textual information on a disk.<br>When combined with a Sony remote-controlled CD player, you can also enjoy wireless CD-synchronized recording that starts playing a CD after releasing the recording pause of the MD recorder itself.</p>
