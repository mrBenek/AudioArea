				<p class="detail">This is a CD player with a unique conical bottom design.<br><br>A vibration control structure with high rigidity and high mass is adopted to eliminate adverse effects due to vibration and resonance.<br>For the CD-5, a steel damper material with a thickness of 1.6 mm and a weight of 1.1 kg is rigidly fixed to the top plate, and a steel damper material with a thickness of 1.2 mm is also used for the bottom plate. By making the upper and lower sides of the casing highly rigid and heavy, a stronger structure is achieved.<br>In addition, the front panel is made of 5 mm thick solid aluminum, and by placing only the minimum necessary keys, the opening is reduced and the influence of sound pressure is reduced.<br><br>A newly developed conical bottom is used for the leg part, and unnecessary vibration is minimized by making pinpoint contact between the body and ground surface. The material of the conical bottom is zinc die-cast, and in addition, the contact surface is protected from corrosion by gold plating on brass at the tip.<br>In addition, in order to ensure that the four bottoms touch the ground, it is equipped with a height adjustment mechanism that can be finely adjusted. In addition, the attached aluminum pedestal realizes a shape-like integration while ensuring pinpoint contact with the bottom.<br><br>The D/A conversion section uses the Philips D/A converter bit stream &quot;SAA7350&quot; and has a 1-bit 4-DAC configuration, thereby eliminating non-linear distortion and 0 cross distortion in principle.<br>The digital filter uses a 20-bit 8-times oversampling digital filter.<br><br>By placing the CD mechanism in the center position, low center of gravity and good weight balance are obtained, and vibration resistance is improved.<br>In addition, the servo system (digital) and the audio system (analog) are separated via the mechanical part to prevent interference between the left and right circuits.<br><br>The CN servo is mounted to reduce the adverse effect of current disturbance caused by servo current on analog system.<br>In this circuit, the driving voltage to the actuator is filtered by a high-precision low-pass filter to reduce unnecessary noise components other than servo current.<br><br>It is equipped with the TFHS (Track Forcus Holding System) mechanism that maintains stable pickup performance without audio skipping.<br>When there is a scratch or dirt on the disk surface, the tracking error signal (up / down) and the focus error signal (left / right) are accurately read, and the trace signal immediately before the scratch or dirt is retained by the pickup. After passing through the scratch or dirt area, it immediately starts reading the pit of the same track, so there is no unpleasant audio skipping.<br><br>It uses carefully selected audio parts such as electrolytic capacitors and power transformers.<br>In addition, precision grade metal film resistance used for measuring equipment is adopted for the resistance on the whole surface, and stable operation is obtained by precision resistance of less than ± 1% within temperature characteristic of 50 ppm / ℃.<br><br>Equipped with a time edit function.<br>This function automatically calculates and programs the number of songs to be recorded on the A/B side when the length of the tape is input when dubbing from a CD to a cassette, and automatically edits the number of songs to fit within time.<br><br>By connecting to a cassette deck that supports the CD sync function using an optional cable, synchronized dubbing of CDs and cassettes is possible.<br><br>It is equipped with random program memory of up to 20 songs and delete program function.<br><br>It is equipped with a music skip function that you can start the current song and the next song with one touch.<br><br>Equipped with a cue lock function that enables music search without holding down the fast forward / fast return buttons.<br><br>Equipped with 4-mode repeat function between 1 song / all songs / program / A and B.<br><br>Equipped with a 3-mode time counter that can display elapsed time, remaining time of one song, and total remaining time.<br><br>It is equipped with functions such as auto space, index search, music search and timer play.<br><br>The exterior of the front panel consists of rough scratch treatment and metallic paint stripe design.<br>In addition, the black model uses a rubber-coated border design.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.<br>This remote control has a built-in pitch control function that can adjust the pitch of sound by up to ± 12% in increments of 1%.</p>
