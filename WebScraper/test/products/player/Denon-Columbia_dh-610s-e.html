				<p class="detail">This is an authentic 38/2 track tape deck developed by DENON which is highly evaluated for professional equipment in broadcasting stations and studios.<br><br>A direct drive capstan system is adopted for the mechanism.<br>The DENON proprietary magnetic recording playback method is used to detect the rotational speed of the direct drive capstan motor. This method reduces wow flutter and achieves extremely fast tape start-up characteristics. In this method, the rotational speed of the motor is controlled by detecting pulses accurately recorded magnetically on the outer circumference of the wheel attached to the shaft of the capstan motor. The capstan motor used in the DH-610S has a smooth outer rotor shape and uses a magnetic material specifically developed to minimize vibration.<br><br>It uses the same electronic tension servo as the DH-710/710S. This mechanism detects the tension of the tape during travel and controls the AC voltage applied to the reel motor. During recording and playback, the tape tension (back tension) between the supply reel and the capstan is kept constant and optimum regardless of the reel size or tape winding diameter. During fast-forwarding and rewinding, the tape tension wound on the reel is kept constant and optimum regardless of the reel size or tape winding diameter.<br>This reduces the wow in the ultra-low range caused by eccentricity of the reel and uneven winding of the tape. In addition, wear of the head and tape is small because excessive tension is not required. In addition, head touch is always stable because the tape tension near the head is constant regardless of the tape winding diameter of the supply reel. In addition, excellent orientation and reality are obtained because there is little phase variation between stereo channels.<br><br>The DH-610S uses a scrape filter roller to reduce the distance to the capstan as much as possible. In addition to reducing the longitudinal vibration of the tape on the head surface, we are seeking optimum conditions such as the angle of the tape in contact with the head and the shape of the head. We also aim to reduce the FM modulation noise by minimizing the flutter generated by the capstan drive system.<br><br>A newly designed special guide roller is used for the part where the tape touches other than the head and the tape shifter. Regardless of the type of tape used, both stable running and magnetic surface protection are achieved.<br><br>A hard permalloy head for broadcasting stations with a wide track width is used for the head, and excellent recording and reproduction characteristics with little noise and little distortion are obtained. In addition, the large size of the reproducing head suppresses low-frequency fluctuations (shape effect) in frequency characteristics at 38cm/s.<br><br>Cue / pause lever is used.<br>This lever operates in pause mode during recording and playback, and in cue mode in conjunction with the muting switch during fast-forward, rewind and stop.<br><br>The bias amount and recording EQ characteristics are continuously adjustable so that they can be adjusted according to the tape.<br><br>A high bias frequency of 180 kHz is used to prevent beat interference when recording FM broadcasts.<br><br>The last stage of the recording amplifier connected to the recording head is a push-pull circuit, and the maximum allowable output level of the recording amplifier is 30 dB or more relative to the reference level as in the case of professional machines.<br><br>It is equipped with a meter with a changeover switch for peak level indication and VU indication.<br><br>Equipped with a microphone attenuator, 12 dB attenuation can be achieved with one touch operation.<br>When used according to the sensitivity and operating conditions of the microphone, the SN ratio is good and microphone recording with a wide dynamic range is possible.<br><br>Equipped with a playback volume with Klix/Klukš top.<br><br>Separately sold options included a shoulder belt and a connector plate to which a square cannon connector (for line input / output only) can be attached.</p>
