				<p class="detail">The Namalok Deck, a sister aircraft of the KD-4.<br><br>ANRS (Automatic Noise Reduction System) is installed as a noise reduction system.<br>With ANRS, you can reduce up to 10 dB only the noise components that are likely to be heard in home recording and playback, such as tape hiss. It is also compatible with other noise reduction systems, so you can enjoy the effect of playing back Dolby B tapes and vice versa.<br><br>A newly developed coreless motor is used as the drive motor to reduce power consumption and enable 12-hour continuous recording with six single dry batteries.<br>In addition, coreless motors have a low moment of inertia and high efficiency, so the response speed to startup is fast and stable operation can be expected.<br><br>An SA (Sen-alloy) head is used for the recording / reproducing head.<br>This head adopts a structure in which a coil is wound around a permalloy laminated core and Sendust alloy is bonded at high temperature to the tape sliding part at the tip. The tape sliding part is made of Sendust alloy, so it has high hardness and can be used for a long time. In addition, there are few chips and cracks, which tend to occur in ferrite, and characteristics are also stable.<br>In addition, since permalloy is used for the coil core and sendust alloy for the tape sliding part, the gap accuracy can be as high as that of ferrite, and the frequency characteristics are extended to the high frequency range. In addition, there is little recording distortion at large signals, and the characteristics are stable against temperature changes during use.<br><br>The preamplifier section is designed with low noise and low distortion rate. In particular, the equalizer circuit uses a 2-stage direct-coupled NF type with negative feedback up to DC to improve the transient characteristics.<br><br>A constant voltage DC-DC converter is used so that a stable voltage can always be supplied to the amplifier even if the battery voltage drops.<br>As a result, a wide dynamic range is obtained without losing linearity of the amplifier section.<br><br>In addition to the left and right independent recording volumes, a left and right linked recording master volume is installed.<br><br>Equipped with a 3-stage switching mechanism of MIC/DIN, -20dB/ATT/MIC and LINE, this allows the input signal to be directly connected to the line amplifier regardless of the microphone amplifier when recording from the player or tuner.<br>The microphone is equipped with a two stage switching type microphone attenuator of 0 dB and -20dB.<br><br>The mechanism part adopts a full auto-stop mechanism with reed switch, and the mechanism automatically releases when the tape finishes winding in any mode.<br>This prevents the battery from being consumed and reduces the extra load on the tape and mechanism. In particular, the energy of the plunger operation when the mechanism is released is the power that is charged to the capacitor for the amplifier power supply during rotation. This reduces the battery consumption and prevents accidental release due to voltage reduction.<br><br>Equipped with a large VU meter.<br><br>Comes with a shoulder belt.<br><br>There were carrying cases and dedicated racks sold separately.</p>
