				<p class="detail">A quartz lock player system for record absorption, inheriting the technology of the TT Model 801 DD turntable.<br><br>It can be used as a turbo disk stabilizer system by using TS-1 which is sold separately.<br>In this system, the air between the record and the turntable is removed so that the entire sound groove portion is uniformly adhered to the turntable at atmospheric pressure. This reduces the vibration of the record and eliminates needle skipping due to warping of the record, which could not be solved with a weight-type stabilizer.<br><br>The tone arm adopts a pipe exchange system, and the special high rigidity material Lummus tapered straight pipe utilizing the light needle pressure cartridge and the universal S-shaped pipe can be freely replaced and used.<br>Tapered straight pipe not only realizes the optimization of low-frequency resonance frequency, but also has high stress against torsion and deflection, and electrical contact of signal system is reduced. Also, the head shell part is carefully treated for vibration isolation.<br>The S-shaped s-shaped pipe is designed to be non-resonant by sealing anti-vibration material or by using a type of chucking lock head connector.<br>The rotary bearing employs a new gimbal support system with a highly sensitive and stable virtual one point support structure developed by JVC. The turntable base and arm base are integrated by a docking plate to adjust the phase of the vibration propagation loop and eliminate harmful intermodulation distortion.<br><br>The counter weight of the tone arm has a dynamic Q-dump mechanism that cancels the resonance of the arm by a multi-resonance system. The weight shaft is firmly fixed to the bearing block without using rubber, etc. This suppresses the resonance of the arm part and the counter weight, etc. and reduces the cross modulation distortion that impairs sound quality.<br>A spare weight for heavy-duty cartridges is included, and various combinations of straight pipes, S-shaped pipes and sub-weights can be used to pursue optimum matching for a wide range of cartridges.<br><br>A coreless DC servo motor is used as the drive motor.<br>In addition to no vibrations caused by cocking, a high torque of up to 3.0kg-cm is achieved by a powerful driving circuit. In addition, a double-servo quartz lock circuit with 30 times higher lock stability is used for rotation control.<br>In addition, the electronic brake utilizing the ± bi-directional servo system with high rotational accuracy makes it possible to switch and stop the rotational speed very smoothly and quickly.<br><br>The turntable weighs 3.05 kg including the mat and has an inertial mass of 470kg-cm.<sup>2</sup>In addition to a zinc vibration-proof ring on the back side, an elastic ring is fitted inside the rim part to completely eliminate resonance.<br>Excellent sound quality has been obtained by combining with a large motor with a shaft diameter of 14 mm and a die-cast base.<br><br>The cabinet uses a solid material laminated cabinet with no resonance and vibration. The exterior is finished with a rose-style real wood finish.<br>The low center of gravity type of the insulator is adopted, and the supporting point position is raised as much as possible to suppress the fluctuation of the cabinet. This insulator is firmly attached to the cabinet via a lead base.<br><br>Equipped with an auto stop up mechanism, the arm automatically lifts when the needle tip enters the inner lead groove of the record and stops the rotation of the turntable.<br>This mechanism is a non-contact speed detection system that does not apply side pressure to the arm, and does not adversely affect sound quality.<br><br>There was a special high rigidity tapered straight arm pipe with black finish as an option sold separately, and the included S-shaped universal arm pipe was also sold separately.<br>High rigidity light alloy tapered straight pipe PH-100 for QL-A75 can also be used.</p>
