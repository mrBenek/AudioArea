				<p class="detail">A double MD deck that combines two recording and re-MD decks.<br><br>It is possible to record simultaneously from CD to MD on A deck and air check on B deck. It is also possible to enjoy MD software on B deck while recording on A deck.<br>A/B deck You cannot record one source at a time.<br><br>You can perform a move edit that allows you to easily move songs between two discs.<br>One track move allows you to move only the songs you like from the original disc to the new disc, and all-move allows you to move all the contents of the MD.<br><br>MD-to-MD dubbing is possible. In addition, when the disc name or song name is entered into the source MD, the title copy function records the text information as well as the music information.<br><br>Relay recording and playback by two MDs of A deck and B deck are possible.<br><br>For the DSP for the 4.5 generation ATRAC, we have newly developed an adaptive high-frequency control technology to improve high-frequency reproducibility and natural sound spread. This technology effectively uses limited data based on the human auditory sense. In response to an input signal, if the number of quantization bits is small, the high-frequency range is limited and the number of quantization bits is increased for a signal that feels distorted, and if the number of quantization bits is small, the high-frequency range is limited and the number of quantization bits is increased. In response to a signal containing a complex frequency component that is less affected by the lack of quantization bits, the reproduction band is extended to higher frequencies to improve high-frequency reproducibility.<br>The signal processing system has been improved by the combination of this adaptive high-frequency control technology and the extension of the operation word length in the wide bit stream, and the total harmonic distortion rate has been improved by about 8 dB compared to the conventional system.<br><br>It is equipped with a sampling rate converter that automatically converts 32 kHz and 48 kHz sampling frequency to 44.1 kHz.<br><br>Equipped with digital REC level control, the gain can be controlled from - ∞ dB to + 12 dB at the center of gain 0 dB.<br>It also has a built-in memory function that can store the set recording level for each input channel.<br><br>Equipped with a pitch control function, you can listen at different playback speeds from -98.5% to + 12.5%.<br><br>It is equipped with a music sync function. When you press the music sync button on the remote control and the connected device starts playing, it senses the input of a music signal and automatically starts recording.<br><br>It is equipped with a time machine recording function. If you press the multi-jog dial in the recording pause state, the sound recorded on the disc is traced back to the sound of up to 6 seconds before.<br><br>Equipped with a monaural recording and playback function that allows the disc to be used twice as long as the display.<br><br>It has a TOC EDTI function that allows you to divide, combine, and move songs. It also has an UNDO function that allows you to cancel the last edit and redo it.<br>It is also equipped with a rehearsal function so that you can make decisions while checking edit points in COMBINE or DIVIDE. You can move edit points finely by minute, second, or frame (approximately 0.01 second).<br><br>Equipped with the A-B ERASE function that allows you to easily erase between two specified points in a song.<br><br>It is equipped with a title function that can record up to 1,700 characters of disc names and song titles on the disc.<br>In addition to conventional alphabets, numbers and symbols, katakana characters can also be input, and input can be done from the main body or remote controller.<br><br>The SCMS (Serial Copy Management System) allows digital recording only for one generation and does not allow digital recording for two or more generations.<br><br>It has a built-in timer for recording messages. It also has an AC outlet so it can be linked with your own tuner.<br><br>It has a GUI-like visual display and uses a full-dot display that can be operated while checking functions.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
