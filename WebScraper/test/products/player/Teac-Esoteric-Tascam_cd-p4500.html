				<p class="detail">CD player with new bit stream D/A converter.<br><br>The D/A converter is equipped with a new bit stream D/A converter based on the Philips SAA7350, which realizes high D/A conversion accuracy and excellent linearity, and in principle eliminates non-linearity and 0 cross distortion.<br>It also uses a 20-bit, 8-times oversampling digital filter.<br><br>Weight balance is achieved by laying out the entire CD mechanism at the center of the body.<br>In addition, by installing a sub-chassis on the bottom chassis and floating it with a special anti-vibration material, the effect of the mechanical system due to the vibration of the main body of the transformer and the effect of the vibration of the CD mechanical part on the transformer are eliminated simultaneously.<br>A special glass fiber with low vibration mode is used for the mechanical base, and it is supported by 3 points which are strong against torsion. In addition, the ideal chassis balance is ensured by making the center of the chassis mass close to the heavyweight parts.<br><br>In order to prevent the servo circuit that controls the motion of the pickup from adversely affecting the analog system, the drive voltage to the actuator is filtered using a low-pass filter unnecessary noise components other than the servo current.<br><br>The pickup section is equipped with TFHS (Track Focus Holding System).<br>When there is a scratch or dirt on the disk surface, the tracking error signal (up / down) and focus error signal (left / right) are accurately read, and the trace signal immediately before the scratch or dirt is retained by the pickup. This mechanism starts reading the pits of the same track immediately after the scratch or dirt passes, preventing unpleasant audio skipping and ensuring stable pickup performance even against black dots.<br><br>In order to eliminate vibration and resonance as much as possible, aluminum pull-out material with sufficient thickness and weight is adopted for the casing, and this is joined to the bonnet of thick steel plate treated with vinyl chloride as a double structure.<br>In addition, the design is flush surface to cope with air vibration from 360 degrees in front, back, left and right. In the front panel, only necessary keys are arranged to minimize the opening as much as possible to eliminate the effect of sound pressure.<br>In addition, a special steel damper material is attached to the bonnet top plate to increase the rigidity.<br><br>All stages are equipped with a DC balanced transmission amplifier, which follows the design concept of the high-grade X-1.<br>The two Line Outs are independently configured to prevent mutual interference, and Line Out1 is directly connected to a DC circuit with superior sound quality.<br>In addition, thorough consideration is given to improving sound quality, such as preventing wire crossing in the circuit to prevent mutual interference of signals.<br><br>It uses a digital volume that can be operated by remote control and does not degrade sound quality.<br>In addition, precision grade metal film resistance used in measuring instruments etc. is adopted entirely, and stable operation is obtained with accuracy of less than ± 1% tolerance within temperature characteristic 50 ppm / ℃.<br><br>With a pitch control function, the pitch of sound can be increased or decreased in increments of 1% by operating the panel surface, and pitch setting of up to ± 12% is possible.<br><br>It is equipped with a time edit function. When you do tape dubbing, you just enter the length of the tape and it will automatically program the music that goes into A side and B side.<br><br>By connecting a cable (sold separately) to the TEAC cassette deck, synchronized dubbing of CD and cassette is possible.<br>You just need to press the sink button on the deck side for the operation, and you can easily edit the tape.<br><br>You can perform operations such as random memory program of up to 20 songs, Delhi and program, music skip, cue lock, 4-mode repeat performance, 3-mode time counter, autospace, index search, and music search.<br>It also has a display ON/OFF function and timer play function.<br><br>A remote control is included.</p>
