				<p class="detail">DAT deck with 1-bit A/D converter and bitstream D/A converter.<br><br>Newly developed 1-bit A/D converter and bit stream D/A converter (SAA7350) are installed in the conversion part.<br>Compared with the multi-bit method, this 1-bit method does not need to take into consideration problems such as resistor error and operation timing deviation, so it has excellent linearity and is free from non-linear distortion and 0 cross distortion in principle.<br>The same device as that used in the D/A converter PD-T07 is used to reduce conversion errors in the case of small signals and improve linearity.<br><br>In order to eliminate the fluctuation of the clock signal, which is important for the 1-bit system, we have adopted a clean clock circuit that separates the clock signal from both audio and digital signals.<br>As a result, the oscillation itself of the clock controlling the system is cleared, and by driving independently, high S/N and low distortion are achieved.<br><br>The head is equipped with a high-power AT (All Track) head developed by Pioneer&#39;s original precision technology.<br>The AT head features an AT structure with uniform track processing of 20 μ m with respect to the track trace direction. Glass is welded on both sides to improve abrasion resistance, and special polishing is applied to the gap which is the signal entrance / exit to realize more stable tape touch.<br>Also, by increasing the reproduction output level by 2 to 6 dB, signal reading with low error rate is realized.<br><br>It is equipped with LP (long time) mode which realizes twice the recording time of SP (standard) mode for analog input recording and digital input recording with sampling frequency of 32 kHz, and enables continuous recording for up to 4 hours with 120 minute tape.<br><br>It is equipped with a Table of Contents (TOC) function that records information such as the program time and the length of each song at the beginning of the tape. This function enables DAT to manage information such as the total number and time of songs, the song time of each song, the start time of each song, and the remaining time of the recorded portion.<br><br>It is equipped with an AI search function of about 300 times at the fastest time (about 600 times at LP time) utilizing the TOC function.<br>As a result, it is equipped with functions such as AI search by TOC information, time skip, one point memory, random play, and fine cue / review.<br><br>You can display time information such as A-Time, which indicates the time elapsed from the beginning of the tape, P-Time, which indicates the time elapsed from the beginning of each song, and an end mark, which indicates the end of the recording.<br><br>The mechanism uses a 1.6 mm flat chassis with a specially processed flat structure, reducing unnecessary vibration generated by the mechanism and realizing more stable tape travel.<br>In addition, it is equipped with Pioneer&#39;s original cassette stabilizer that suppresses vibration of the cassette half. The cassette half is sandwiched by special rubber at the top and bottom. In addition, the left and right two places are pressed with resin to firmly fix the cassette half and reduce vibration.<br><br>A large honeycomb insulator with excellent vibration damping characteristics and a honeycomb chassis are used for the chassis.<br><br>In order to reduce adverse effects caused by unnecessary vibration of the drum, the structure of the rotating drum has been completely revised and a low-vibration and low-noise structure has been adopted.<br><br>Direct construction is adopted for the input volume, and the signal from the analog input terminal is input to the input volume at the shortest distance, thus reducing degradation due to routing of the signal path.</p>
