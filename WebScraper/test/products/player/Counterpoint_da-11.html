				<p class="detail">Counter point The first CD transport.<br><br>The pickup mechanism uses Philips&#39; three beam mechanism CDM12.1.<br>In the CDM12.1, a linear tracking system called a straight-line tracking sledge is adopted for the transport system of the laser optics system, realizing quiet operation and a light and robust mechanism.<br>A holographic laser diffraction grating developed for the Philips CDM9 and CDM9PRO is used in the light pen for focusing and tracking the pit rows. In addition to the main beam for direct reading of data, two beams slightly shifted to the left and right are irradiated, and the error is detected to realize more accurate reading.<br><br>The control circuit uses a DSIC (Digital Servo IC) with a unique concept. The signal from the pickup photodiode is analyzed and processed by software, and the servo characteristics of focus, tracking, and sledge are adjusted.<br>Usually, the adjustment of the transport such as the amount of reflected laser light is done manually at the factory, but the initial setting changes over time. In the DA-11, the DSIC constantly feeds back information and automatically adjusts the transport state optimally to maintain the best condition.<br><br>The source signal is decoded by a single-chip digital IC. In the DA-11, the FIFO (First In First Out) buffer, which is normally incorporated into the chip, is separated into an 8 kbyteRAM chip that operates on a dedicated power supply and clock. By this, the pulse signal that enters irregularly due to various conditions, such as slight eccentricity and warpage of the disk, is stored once and sent out at a timing that is precisely synchronized with the clock to reduce the problem of jitters.<br>The independent FIFO buffer design also reduces cross-modulation between different clocks in the same chip.<br><br>The pick-up mechanism is located at the center of the housing structure with the lowest resonance. The disk tray is processed from solid aluminum by the metal shop of Counterpoint. This solid and precise structure reduces unnecessary mechanical vibration and vibration caused by sound pressure.<br>In addition, the entire pickup mechanism is isolated from internal and external vibrations by a suspension structure using silicon rubber vibration damping material.<br><br>The switch is made of the same aluminum material as the disk tray.<br><br>The display can be turned on / off.<br><br>It has a random playback function and a scan function that plays only the first part of the track for a few seconds.<br><br>The output terminal uses ST Link Glass Optical, TOSLINK Plastic Optical and BNC Coaxial.<br>There are two types of BNC coaxes : &quot;Isorated&quot;, which is connected via a transformer to provide earth floating from the drive electronics, and &quot;Direct&quot;, which is connected directly to the DA-11 circuit. You can choose the type of BNC coaxes according to your preference.<br><br>A dedicated wireless remote control is included.</p>
