				<p class="detail">A CD player with a Legato link conversion in addition to a CD turntable system.<br><br>For natural CD playback that is closer to the original music signal, it is equipped with Legato link conversion.<br>Legato Link Conversion captures music signals on the time axis and connects music signal data smoothly over time. Based on the signal recorded on a CD, the signal is connected using a function curve set to approximate the original music signal, thereby obtaining a waveform close to the original music signal with less ringing.<br>By realizing waveform transmission with excellent impulse response, frequency components of 20 kHz or higher corresponding to 1/f attenuation characteristics can be reproduced, making soft and natural music playback possible.<br><br>The mechanism section employs a CD turntable mechanism with a pickup and spindle motor moved upward. This allows the disc to be held from the bottom to the entire surface, reducing unnecessary vibration.<br>The moment of inertia of the turntable is three times larger than that of the conventional system, and it is resistant to load fluctuations and realizes stable rotational performance.<br><br>The D/A converter uses a high-speed pulse flow D/A converter developed independently.<br>This D/A converter reduces the requantization noise by operating the noise shaper at a high oversampling frequency of 384 fs. By increasing the oversampling frequency, the noise shaper order can also be used at a low second order, reducing the effect of out-of-band noise and analog low-pass filters on sound quality.<br>In addition, by operating the master clock at a low clock frequency of 16.93 MHz, the effect of jitter is minimized.<br>This D/A converter also increases the duty ratio, which is the on/off timing ratio of the 1-bit output, from 50% to 100%. This doubles the output level and provides audio output with a high SN ratio and low distortion.<br><br>We have adopted an in-house developed Clean Laser Pickup.<br>This pickup uses fewer optical components and less aberration in the optical path to improve laser efficiency and realize low-distortion signal reading. In addition, it uses a photodetector with built-in I/V head amplifier and an accurate focus system to reduce the effects of reading errors and jitter. The pickup body uses a high-precision engineering pickup body.<br><br>The audio circuit uses a class-A operation FET buffer amplifier. The low-output impedance reduces the influence of the load of connected equipment. In addition, the class-A operation reduces the fluctuation of power consumption during operation and realizes a low distortion factor.<br><br>In order to completely eliminate vibration and resonance that adversely affect sound quality, newly developed acoustic shell construction has been adopted. By making the shape rounded like a shell, it has high rigidity and excellent vibration resistance.<br>The underbase on the bottom has a shell shape with a loose R and is protein coated. This shell shape has the effect of diffusing sound pressure inside and outside. The side chassis and both side panels on the upper part of the mechanism are also shell-shaped to eliminate parallel surfaces that tend to generate standing waves as much as possible.<br>In addition, the two underbases have a solid structure in which a copper plated 2 mm thick steel plate is placed on the bottom of the underbase via a 20 mm thick extruded aluminum beam. In addition, a space is secured between the two underbases, and the wiring material from the power transformer for audio is passed through the bottom and connected to the upper audio circuit board from the closest point to the upper audio circuit board. We also pursue direct construction to minimize signal path.<br>We have also adopted a metal-machined shell-type insulator to absorb external vibrations.<br><br>Equipped with three independent transformers for digital &amp; servo, analog and D/A converters, and a 6-part, 15-regulator power supply circuit to separate six parts for digital &amp; servo, servo drive, D/A converter, audio +, - and FL to eliminate mutual interference.<br>A newly developed discrete power supply is used for the audio circuit, and for the D/A converter, a rectifier circuit and an independent stabilizing power supply circuit are used from a dedicated transformer to eliminate the influence of other power supplies.<br>The power supply for the servo drive is independent for the turntable and for other drives to ensure stability, and the digital output is also a dedicated power supply.<br><br>A brushless hole motor with a starting torque of 65g ・ cm is used for the spindle motor that supports the turntable system. Combined with a φ 4.5 mm extra-thick shaft, it realizes stable rotational performance that is resistant to load fluctuations.<br>In addition, the pickup is driven by a silent linear motor servo mechanism to realize high speed access.<br><br>In order to prevent vibration from being transmitted to the board and power supply, we are making the disk drive and mechanism vibration-free and resonance-free.<br>In addition to the silent chassis, which covers the entire mechanism and improves vibration resistance, the lamisert mechanism base, which is molded with special resin by overlapping two different metals, and the turntable base is mounted on the mechanism chassis via coaxial suspension and has a double float structure, reducing unnecessary vibration from inside and outside.<br><br>Equipped with a balanced output that is not easily affected by external noise.<br><br>Uses an OFC4-core power cord with polarity display with separate core wires for digital &amp; servo and analog only.<br><br>Aluminum panel stabilizer with increased rigidity and vibration resistance is adopted.<br><br>Equipped with a display off switch to prevent scanning noise. Also equipped with a clean microcomputer (for backup).<br><br>Equipped with digital / analog change-over switch (for backup)<br><br>Non-magnetic gold plated RCA output jack is used.<br>Also, OFC (oxygen-free copper) is used for the analog circuit board.</p>
