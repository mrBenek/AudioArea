				<p class="detail">An address loaded 3-head cassette deck that can also be used as an address unit.<br><br>Both recording and reproducing heads have excellent head touch and use a new type combination head with less level fluctuation. The head for recording is larger than that for reproducing heads to improve the bias characteristics. Moreover, the contour is reduced by the unique tip shape. The recording head is configured to ensure that the tape pad is in contact with the recording head. In addition, by adding a tension mechanism to the erasing head part, appropriate tension is applied and good head touch is obtained.<br>Super AP with excellent bias efficiency and frequency characteristics is used for the head material.<br><br>The PC-X88AD is equipped with an address as a noise reduction system. The PC-X88AD has an address for recording and playback separately built-in enabling simultaneous recording and monitoring.<br>In addition, Dolby NR is also a double system, and recording simultaneous monitoring is possible.<br><br>The mechanism uses 2-motor IC logic and new simple mechanism which inherited the idea of simple and silent mechanism.<br>In this mechanism, the capstan drive and the reel base drive are each driven by independent motors using a simple two motor system. In particular, by using a motor with less cocking for the reel base motor, torque unevenness is improved.<br>In addition, the automatic reverse take-up mechanism, which changes the take-up direction according to the motor rotation direction, uses a swing-head gear drive mechanism instead of the conventional reverse idler method. By adopting a high-precision gear and a design that does not require friction in the reverse mechanism, the rotational control ability of the motor for driving the reel table is improved.<br>In addition, the main rotating shaft is laid out on the same chassis to improve the accuracy of the rotating system. In addition, independent back tension is set for constant-speed and high-speed driving to prevent the tape from sagging to improve driving stability. This back tension is also used for bluffing, making it possible to stop smoothly.<br><br>It can also be used as a 4-channel address unit and can be connected to your deck for address recording. In this case, set the switch to the EXT DECK/CAL position and use the CAL adjustment volume to calibrate with the deck. If you set the switch to the ADJ position, the CAL adjustment volume can adjust the level of the PC-X88AD when decoding an address tape encoded by another unit.<br><br>The power supply section consists of a total of 13 constant voltage circuits, including 6 ± 2 electric Minamoto no Sadamu voltage circuits (address recording / playback, Dolby recording / playback, 2 amplifier circuits) and a constant voltage circuit for mechanical devices.<br>The read head is directly connected to a differential configuration DC equalizer amplifier using Igm dual FET 2SK-150 to reduce distortion and improve the SN ratio.<br><br>You can play back the address record.<br>In this case, the switch is set to the address disk position, the Address CAL TONE seat is placed on the player, and the reference level of the address is taken. This is done on the Recording Master Volume, and the reference level can be adjusted with one touch by setting the level marker on the Recording Master Volume.<br><br>In addition to 4-step simultaneous switching of bias and equalizer, it is equipped with a bias fine adjustment function which can change the bias value subtly.<br><br>When the input selector switch is set to the OSC position, a 1 kHz frequency signal can be input as a test signal. This allows the recording sensitivity adjustment (SENS (REC)) knob to be adjusted to maintain a constant recording / playback level for each tape.<br><br>In addition to auto rewind and auto repeat, memory rewind / stop and memory repeat can be performed with the memory counter.<br><br>Equipped with a timer standby mechanism, you can record your absence or play an alarm clock by connecting an audio timer (sold separately).<br><br>The REC mute function works as long as the Pause button is pressed, and the moment you release the Pause button, the Pause button is activated.<br><br>It has an output volume.<br><br>The microphone terminal is mounted on the back.<br><br>Compatible with optional remote control.</p>
