				<p class="detail">This cassette deck is the standard model of the V series.<br><br>The V-Series uses a center mount system. By placing the tape transport mechanism in the center, which has high structural stability, weight distribution bias is eliminated. By eliminating weight distribution bias, the occurrence of chassis distortion, etc. is greatly reduced.<br>In addition, since it is located away from the legs, the effect of external vibration is eliminated.<br><br>The recording / reproducing head uses a high-purity PCOCC winding CA (cobalt amorphous) recording / reproducing combination 3 head.<br>The CA-head is a 14-layer thin-film laminate that takes advantage of its amorphous, non-crystalline structure. It significantly improves high-frequency characteristics by reducing eddy current loss. In addition, the internal winding uses 99.997% pure PGCC (single-crystal high-purity oxygen-free copper), a well-known high-efficiency transmission material, to reduce slight distortion and transmission loss at the head.<br><br>The head base is made of zinc alloy die-cast, reducing the influence of slight vibration on the head part and greatly reducing modulation noise. In addition, since the head can always be positioned accurately, the azimuth angle, high-frequency characteristics and phase characteristics can be maintained with high precision over a long period of time.<br><br>A 3-motor system has been adopted for the mechanism part, enabling reliable operation of each section.<br><br>A frequency distributed closed-loop dual capstan system is used for the driving mechanism.<br>In the closed-loop dual capstan system, two sets of capstan and pinch rollers located on both sides of the head keep the tape tension constant and eliminate external influences such as microvibration to ensure excellent running performance.<br>Based on this method, we adopted a frequency-distributed system in which the diameters of the left and right pinch rollers are slightly changed, which cancels the periodic fluctuation of the tachometer and greatly reduces wow flutter.<br>In addition, the capstan has been subjected to a precision etching process on the order of sub-micron to increase the gripping force of the tape and prevent slight tape slippage. In addition, the capstan motor shaft is equipped with a high-precision large flywheel, which greatly increases the inertia mass and realizes more stable rotation.<br><br>The regenerative amplifier employs an all-stage monaural all-DC configuration amplifier based on the direct coupling method of two power supplies, eliminating interference between the left and right channels and improving separation and phase characteristics.<br>The head amplifier section is also an FET differential input DC amplifier without an input coupling capacitor, which greatly improves low-frequency noise characteristics.<br><br>The power supply part reduces interference by separating the mechanism system and the read / write amplifier system from the transformer winding.<br>A custom-made electrolytic capacitor for audio is used for the power supply.<br><br>The chassis uses a super-high rigid chassis designed to improve rigidity and vibration control. On top of a heavyweight bottom chassis, front and rear panels, a unique mechanical chassis and center chassis are firmly integrated to eliminate external vibration and internal resonance and to prevent twisting and bending of the body.<br><br>It is equipped with an anti-static cassette stabilizer to suppress microvibration of the cassette half. The whole half is strongly pressed and loaded to reduce modulation noise caused by harmful microvibration. The arm part has a 2-layer aluminum structure with a thickness of 2 mm, and the cassette holder part has a high rigidity with a steel plate with a thickness of 1.6 mm to realize a vibration-resistant structure that suppresses resonance and prevents deformation such as deflection of the holder part.<br>In addition, the V-5010 is equipped with a 4-point special damping rubber on the body side, and the cassette half is held from both sides to realize an even more secure hold.<br>Anti-static cassette stabilizers are equipped with highly conductive special pads that are always attached to the half. By releasing static electricity, the half is prevented from being charged, and the occurrence of trouble is greatly reduced.<br><br>The cassette half has its own triangle support system.<br>In the general method, it is held at 4 points, but there is a possibility that one part will float, which causes vibration due to looseness. In the triangle support system, by supporting at the most effective 3 points, looseness is eliminated and the half is held firmly.<br><br>An extruded aluminum material with a maximum thickness of 6 mm is used for the cassette loading part, and generation and propagation of vibration are greatly suppressed.<br>In addition, the V-5010 uses a newly developed special polymer material for the cassette holder, which is five times stronger than conventional materials, has high sound velocity, and has excellent vibration damping characteristics with excellent internal loss, thereby eliminating microvibrations around the cassette tape.<br><br>The internal layout of each circuit is separated by an internal chassis. In addition to the input, control, amplifier and display sections, the mechanism section is completely shielded to eliminate electrical and physical interference between the sections.<br><br>The internal structure pursues high rigidity. In addition to the chassis exclusively for the mechanism part, it uses an independent side chassis and a center chassis connecting the front and rear parts. It is firmly assembled on a heavyweight bottom chassis that supports the entire bottom. In addition, the thick front and rear panels and the inverted U-shaped top panel are firmly integrated. In addition, it uses a copper-plated chassis that reduces high-frequency noise.<br>In addition, it is equipped with a chassis exclusively for the mechanism, and the rigidity of the mechanism is greatly improved by the strong double structure with the bottom chassis, and the effect of external vibration is eliminated.<br><br>OFC material with polarity indication is used for power cord.<br>In addition, it uses parts such as recording volume and gold plated terminal with attention paid to the feeling of operation.<br><br>Equipped with a Dolby B/C-NR system as a noise reduction system.<br><br>Equipped with a Dolby HX Pro recording system that expands the high-frequency recording capability of the tape.<br><br>Equipped with a bias level calibration system of independent configuration for left and right, it is possible to adjust the optimum bias value and level for each tape.<br>When adjusting, the meter scale automatically changes and accurate adjustment is possible using the built-in oscillator.<br><br>The circuit section uses the shortest path design with as few wires as possible to reduce sound quality degradation and noise interference caused by wire routing.<br>In particular, the recording volume and input terminal are designed to be directly attached, and the input signal is sent directly to the line amplifier section. In addition, the recording volume is a custom-made unit that is strictly adjusted, and the phase change due to the recording level is suppressed by the strict level control of right and left.<br><br>Uses a double FL display.<br>This display is equipped with a linear time tape counter that displays the amount of tape run in time.<br><br>It is equipped with a CPS automatic song selection function of 15 songs before and after which you can start the song you want to listen with one touch.<br><br>Equipped with CD direct input.<br>In addition, it is equipped with a CD level check function that allows you to adjust the recording level while the CD player is fast-forwarded.<br><br>It is equipped with functions such as return to 0 function, auto monitor, auto tape selector and auto rec mute.<br><br>The cassette loading section is equipped with a power load / eject function using a special motor for opening and closing the cassette loading section, enabling reliable and stable tape loading by opening and closing with a fixed force.<br><br>It is compatible with CD sync function and can be synchronized with TEAC CD player by using an optional cable.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.<br>The display can be turned on / off with this remote control.</p>
