				<p class="detail">Cassette deck with horizontal loading mechanism.<br><br>A tray type horizontal loading mechanism is adopted.<br>By mounting the deck mechanism horizontally, vibration in the thrust direction of the flywheel is suppressed and modulation noise is reduced. In addition to the use of ceramic composite for the cassette tray, a 4-motor configuration with motors for the reel, capstan, head lifting / lowering, and loading realizes stable tape travel and smooth operation without rotational unevenness by using a 4-motor configuration.<br><br>The mechanism section employs a computer-controlled silent mechanism using a closed-loop dual capstan system.<br>In the closed-loop dual capstan system, disturbance such as vibration of the reel is cut off between two sets of capstan, and modulation noise caused by vibration of the tape is greatly reduced, and smooth head touch and quiet driving force are always obtained.<br>In the silent mechanism, the mechanism control and counter display function are controlled by a microcomputer integrated into one chip, and smooth operation is achieved. Even if the power is turned off during recording or playback, the pinch roller returns to the STOP position to prevent damage to the tape. In addition, the pinch roller rises very quickly after pressing the REC button, and it is strong in recording timing.<br><br>The capstan motor uses an electronically controlled DC-motor with strong torque and no rotational irregularities, while the take-up capstan uses a fly-wheel with a large moment of inertia, greatly reducing wow and flutter.<br><br>Equipped with a non-slip reel drive mechanism to always maintain the optimum tension of the tape.<br>In addition, since there is no mechanical friction between the motor and the take-up reel stand, there is no noise or aging change when the tape is taken up, and uniform constant speed running from the beginning to the end of the tape is possible.<br><br>A cassette stabilizer (C. C. C. S) made of ceramic composite and a cassette tray (C. C. C. T) are used in order to reduce vibration and modulation noise of the cassette half during tape travel. This ensures stable tape travel.<br><br>A combination head using single-crystal oxygen-free copper (PC-OCC) wire with less signal degradation has been adopted for the read / write head to improve high-frequency characteristics and MOL characteristics.<br>In addition, the head base is made of aluminum die-cast, and by fixing it firmly without interfering with the movement of the head, unnecessary vibration and aberration of azimuth are suppressed.<br><br>A DC amplifier configuration is used for the playback / recording amplifier section.<br>The L/R channel amplifier is integrated into a single chip IC for the playback equalizer amplifier to greatly reduce the noise level generated in the amplifier section. In addition, by connecting the playback head and the amplifier directly and eliminating the coupling capacitor, the degradation of low-frequency characteristics is eliminated.<br>The power supply section is composed of ± 2 power supplies to increase the saturation level of the amplifier section and obtain a wide dynamic range.<br><br>Equipped with Dolby HX Pro.<br>This function automatically adjusts the bias level to the optimum value to prevent over-bias in the high frequency range.<br><br>Equipped with a Dolby B/C type noise reduction system.<br><br>Equipped with an auto tape selector, it automatically detects the set tape position and sets it according to type I (normal), II (high position) and IV (metal).<br><br>Equipped with an auto tape monitor.<br>This function automatically monitors the recorded sound when it is set to Play or RecPlay (Rec Mute). It switches to Source when the tape is not running.<br><br>Equipped with Rec Return function.<br>The recording start position is memorized by the computer, and when the Rec return key is pressed, it automatically returns to the original start position and enters the standby state.<br><br>Equipped with an FL peak level meter that can display from -40dB to + 10 dB.<br>This meter is equipped with a peak hold function.<br><br>Equipped with a manual bias control function, the bias fine volume allows you to fine-tune the optimum recording bias value for each tape, which may vary slightly.<br><br>Equipped with a linear time digital counter that can display the remaining amount of tape.<br>This counter is equipped with a tape size selector and memory stop mechanism.<br><br>Equipped with Music Search.<br><br>Equipped with a slack prevention mechanism.<br><br>Equipped with a follow-up recording function.<br><br>Equipped with an auto recording space function, you can make a 4-second space between songs.<br><br>It is equipped with an MPX filter switch to prevent malfunction of the Dolby system by cutting off the 19 khz pilot signal of the FM signal. The filter is automatically disabled when Dolby B/C Noise Reduction is not used.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
