				<p class="detail">A manual type record player that takes advantage of the good unit design as well as the high-grade model.<br>There were 2 types, PL-30 of the normal version and PL-30L with the silent lift-up function.<br><br>The drive unit is equipped with an SH-rotor type phono motor, similar to the high-grade model.<br>By moving the rotor bearing, which used to be located at the bottom of the motor, just below the turntable, we have succeeded in greatly reducing the wow and flutter, realizing excellent characteristics.<br>In addition, a quartz PLL DC servo Hall motor with a starting torque of 1.3kg-cm is adopted for the motor, and the motor is 330kg-cm.<sup>2</sup>By combining a large turntable with an inertial mass of 1 g, stability without load fluctuation is realized even under a load of 200g.<br>In addition, three Hall elements developed by Pioneer are used in the magnetic pole switching mechanism of the motor. In addition, fine noise is suggested by requiring micron-order machining accuracy even for fine parts.<br>The turntable uses a turntable sheet with excellent acoustic characteristics.<br><br>In order to suppress low-frequency resonance caused by warping or eccentricity of records, a silicon oil braking system (capable of on/off operation) is adopted.<br>By pressing the warping knob on the upper part of the arm shaft, the braking fin sinks into the silicon injected into the oil cup, and viscous braking is applied to the arm. Moreover, by cutting the tip of the braking fin (ring shape) at 45 degrees, it is designed to apply appropriate braking in both horizontal and vertical directions.<br>This reduces harmful low-frequency resonance and greatly reduces cross-modulation distortion, which adversely affects the audible band.<br>It uses silicon oil, which has no viscosity change with time or temperature, and is excellent as a braking oil. In addition, by storing this silicon oil in an oil cup made with high precision, it has high reliability without oil oozing out.<br><br>Uses a die-castable arm base with a stabilizing effect.<br>In addition, a long type arm with an effective length of 250 mm using a high-rigidity aluminum pipe is adopted for the arm. In addition, by adopting a mass concentration system in which the main weight is close to the arm shaft, the moment of inertia of the arm is reduced, and the basic performance of the arm itself is improved before oil braking is applied.<br><br>In order to suppress vibrations such as howling, we have adopted a high-density cabinet made of carefully selected conifers.<br>In addition, a newly developed large insulator with a low center of gravity structure is used for the insulator that supports the cabinet, making it resistant to external vibrations.<br><br>By using the separately sold damping adjustment adapter, it can be adjusted at the level of 1 to 5 similar to the PL-70, and it becomes a level braking amount variable arm which can respond to the compliance of any cartridge.<br>When mounting a cartridge with heavy weight (Orthophone SPU-GT type, etc.), it is recommended to use an exchange weight (sold separately).<br><br>The PL-30L is equipped with a silent lift-up function that realizes accurate and quiet operation.<br>First of all, the arm is raised and lowered using a moving coil system that applies the operation principle of a speaker. It operates without contact with DC voltage.<br>In addition, the end position of the recording groove is detected by non-contact detection using a Hall element mounted inside the arm shaft and a magnet mounted opposite the Hall element.<br>In addition, it is equipped with a pure electronic quick stop mechanism that works in conjunction with a silent lift-up mechanism to stop the turntable instantly.</p>
