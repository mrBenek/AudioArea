				<p class="detail">This model was developed as a two head cassette deck with total quality almost equivalent to 1000/700.<br><br>A super head has been adopted for the head, and the strain characteristics have been improved, and the durability over 10,000 hours has been realized.<br>In addition, the Direct Flux Erase Head has been adopted for the erase head, providing excellent erasing capability.<br><br>The mechanism uses a resonance diffusion double capstan system to achieve clearer sound.<br>By changing the diameters of the two capstans, resonance frequencies are dispersed to avoid peak overlap, and wow and flutter are reduced, and modulation noise is also greatly improved.<br>In addition, we have adopted a resonance braking mechanism to eliminate vibration generated by motors and other rotating bodies.<br>Consideration was given to the material and structure of the chassis, and the chassis is made mainly of aluminum, which has much higher damping characteristics than iron, and combined with resin molding to prevent harmful vibrations.<br><br>The recording amplifier is a DC amplifier that is directly connected to the head and eliminates the coupling capacitor, thereby reducing the phase around in the low frequency range and realizing a low distortion factor.<br>In addition, the linearity has been improved to raise the clipping level so that accurate recording can be performed from very small input to very large input.<br>In addition, the recording and playback equalizer uses a double-NF circuit to minimize sound quality degradation.<br><br>By eliminating the erase head between the two capstan sections, contact resistance between the tape and the head is reduced and modulation noise is reduced.<br>In addition, the height adjustment mechanism for the tape is used to prevent the occurrence of azimuth loss by performing parallel movement by interlocking the gear.<br><br>It has a transmission function so that you can easily find the beginning of the music.<br>If you press the pause button during FF or REW, the speed will be reduced to 1/2 and the recorded sound will be heard. If you then press the FF or REW button, the speed will be further reduced to 1/4 of the original speed so that you can easily start the song.<br><br>MPX filter, 47 dB full-range peak level meter, Dolby NR, 400Hz0dB test tone, bias adjustment volume, tape start memory, etc.<br><br>Wireless operation is possible with the separately sold remote control unit.<br>It consists of a transmitter and a receiver and is operated by a logic circuit.</p>
