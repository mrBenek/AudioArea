				<p class="detail">This CD player inherits the design philosophy and basic configuration of the D-500X&#39;s and D-500X&#39; sII, and has been reconsidered with the aim of further perfection.<br><br>By adopting a top-loading system and eliminating unstable structures such as slide mechanisms, harmful resonance caused by unstable moving parts and effects of turbulence on the disk itself are suppressed.<br>In addition, the entire loading section has a floating structure and is mounted on a solid base to prevent internal and external vibrations and improve tracing capability. In addition, the shape of the recess used to eject the disc is designed to reduce turbulence during rotation.<br><br>The Philips CDM-3 pickup mechanism is used for the pickup part.<br>In the CDM-3, a die-cast swing arm with a clear fulcrum and a pantograph-structured focus mechanism that keeps the disc in parallel are mounted on the die-cast frame. In addition, the single-beam system, which eliminates the influence of the side-beam, ensures high optical performance. This high-precision pick-up mechanism suppresses excessive load fluctuations in the servo circuit, reducing the influence on the power supply and jitter.<br><br>The digital filter uses an 8 x oversampling digital filter and the D/A converter is equipped with a high-precision 18-bit DAC. The requantization error and distortion associated with DA conversion are overcome by the pursuit of accuracy, and the configuration is simple enough to cover the basics of the converter. This reduces the burden of complex arithmetic processing and minimizes digital noise.<br><br>The top panel and bottom plate face each other obliquely, and the body is sandwiched in a wedge shape to form a strong structure. This eliminates natural vibrations and twisting, and ensures excellent stability against external vibrations.<br>In addition, materials with different vibration modes, such as FRP, aluminum, steel plate, and wood, are placed in appropriate positions to minimize resonance and enhance synthesis of the entire structure.<br><br>By separating the substrate of the servo circuit, which is sensitive to vibration, from the mechanism, the effect of slight vibration is shielded.<br><br>The power supply section is equipped with a 100 VA class power transformer to achieve excellent regulation.<br>In addition, the DAC / analog section, control section, accessory section, FL display section and FL heater section are each supplied with power from separate windings. By configuring an independent power source in the Line 5, interference between circuits is suppressed and noise is prevented from entering the signal path.<br>The power supply for power supply for the analog section is provided with an electrostatic shield from the winding inside the transformer for thorough cleaning. Moreover, by forming a strong power supply circuit, the instantaneous movement of the mechanism that consumes a large current is prevented from affecting the log signal.<br><br>A bus bar is used for the power supply circuit, and by suppressing impedance fluctuation when power is supplied to each circuit, a margin for instantaneous current supply is secured.<br><br>Noise reduction measures are taken by utilizing know-how acquired in amplifier manufacturing such as selection of appropriate circuits and processing of more advanced ground patterns. In addition to eliminating noise sources by adopting shield plates and changing layout, the SN ratio in the sense of hearing is improved by thorough measures against high-frequency noise.<br><br>High-quality parts are used everywhere to maximize performance from a simple circuit configuration.<br>Custom parts such as pure focus condenser for sound quality, RMA resistance, originally developed electrolytic condenser for sound quality, and copper foil styrene condenser with copper tube are adopted.<br><br>Analog output is equipped with one fixed output, and digital output is equipped with one coaxial output terminal.<br><br>The D-500 has a thorough internal polarity control.<br>It is also equipped with a line phase sensor that can control the power polarity (plug insertion direction).<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
