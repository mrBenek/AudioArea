				<p class="detail">Stereo tape deck with F &amp; F (ferrite &amp; ferrite) head.<br><br>The F &amp; F (Ferrite &amp; Ferrite) head is an all-ferrite head that uses ferrite for all core and guard sections. The gap spacer and core sections are fixed using Sony&#39;s proprietary technology that fuses ferrite and high-hardness glass with uniform wear characteristics.<br>As a result, we have achieved superior performance in terms of wear characteristics, changes over time and gap width compared with the head of the type in which ferrite or glass is laminated and bonded. This prevents the head from being reduced in one direction or the inline nature of the gap from collapsing, thus preventing the characteristics of the gap from deteriorating.<br>In addition, since the surface of the head is finished with a black mirror, the head touch of the tape is good and dust does not easily stick.<br><br>It uses a 3-head system in which each head for erasing, recording and playback is independent. You can check (monitor) the recording state by playing back the head recorded with the recording head with the reproducing head.<br><br>Equipped with a tape selector with an equalizer switching method, it is possible to display the performance of Sony SLH (Super Low Noise High Output) tapes and low-noise tapes of other companies.<br>Compared with the commonly used bias switching method, the compensation amount is less and the average range can be higher, so that excellent characteristics can be obtained.<br><br>The preamp section reduces the high-frequency loss of the head, so that the characteristics of the playback equalizer can be brought closer to the ideal curve and the amplifier noise can be reduced accordingly.<br>In addition, a low-noise, high-gain silicon transistor is used to further reduce amplifier noise, thereby increasing the recording bias frequency and preventing noise and beat.<br>In addition, a luxurious constant-voltage power supply circuit is incorporated to prevent clicks during recording and playback and to ensure stable operation of each amplifier.<br><br>By using an anti-vibration type motor, we have realized a mechanism that eliminates vibration and noise in the machine part.<br>In addition, in order to improve usability and reliability, it is equipped with a electron spectroscopy for chemica analysis rate drive that allows the pinch roller to sink when the tape stops and allows the tape to be easily applied, a mechanical tension servo that always applies appropriate tension from the beginning to the end of winding the tape and eliminates speed deviation and uneven winding caused by changes in the winding diameter, and a built-in reel lock that reliably locks the reel just by pulling and turning the reel shaft.<br><br>Equipped with a mechanical shut-off mechanism that automatically turns off the power of the mechanism and stops the motor when the tape finishes winding, and simultaneously returns the operation lever and the mechanism connected to it to the stopped state.<br>This prevents a failure that occurs when the pinch roller or idler is left pressed and deformed.<br><br>Equipped with Sony&#39;s unique anti-vibration roller, it absorbs the subtle vibrations that occur at the interface between the tape and the head in advance.<br>This eliminates modulation noise, which causes turbidity and dirt in the high-frequency range, and improves resolution.<br><br>It is a slant type with a slightly inclined operation panel, and by removing the cabinet and replacing it, it can be a vertical or horizontal type.<br><br>It is equipped with various functions such as an output volume, a microphone attenuator switch that can switch the microphone input to two levels, two input volumes that can mix the microphone / line, and Sound on Sound and Echo recording with the attached cord.</p>
