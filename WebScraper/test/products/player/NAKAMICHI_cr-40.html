				<p class="detail">This cassette deck was developed with feedback from the latest amplifier technology cultivated in the development of high-grade control amplifiers.<br><br>A fully independent discrete three head system is used for the head part.<br>In this method, each head can be completely independent, preventing the deterioration of the high-frequency characteristics due to the magnetic azimuth shift that occurs during actual recording with the Combination 3 head.<br>In addition, Nakamichi&#39;s original head alignment system has been adopted. The head height, azimuth, and tilt (front and back tilt) of each head are precisely adjusted one by one while actually running the test tape by the adjustment screw incorporated in the solid main base. This drives the characteristics to the utmost limit and always enables stable ultra-high-range playback.<br><br>The head uses a crystal head.<br>The core of this head is laminated with a thin crystalline material to minimize high-frequency frequency loss of the head by carrying out all the work through a chemical process that does not stress the material at all. This allows for a difference in sound resolution and elongation compared with a single deck in which the head loss is compensated by the amplifier even at the same 20 kHz recording and playback.<br>The recording head uses Nakamichi&#39;s unique focused gap method, which generates an extremely sharp magnetic field, enabling deep recording on the tape. Tapes recorded with this method can maintain a wide dynamic range over the entire band and are resistant to demagnetization, making them suitable for long-term storage.<br>In addition, we have sought to improve S/N by reducing the size of the head. In general, small heads tend to produce low-frequency waviness due to the contour effect, but we have solved this problem by reducing low-frequency waviness even if it is small.<br><br>A reference DC amplifier of all stages DC configuration newly developed for the CR series is adopted in the amplifier section.<br>The playback amplifier is a fully discrete configuration, and the dynamic characteristics are improved by achieving low noise and stability with a simple circuit, avoiding the differential system which makes the circuit complicated. The recording amplifier is a pure A-class operation, which brings out the performance of the recording head.<br>In addition, line amplifiers and headphone amplifiers have also been converted into DC amplifiers, resulting in overall high performance.<br><br>In order to reduce interference with the audio part such as the logic part and bias circuit, and wamble of the power supply voltage of each part, the multi-regulated power supply, which is also used in the Nakamichi CD player, is installed in the power supply part. It consists of an independent 2-winding transformer, three master power regulators, and ten local power regulators to prevent mutual interference.<br><br>The sound recording calibration mechanism uses a 15 kHz test tone, making it possible to make more severe adjustments than decks that adjust at lower frequencies such as 8 kHz.<br><br>The drive motor is a brushless, slotless, coreless type DD capstan motor.<br>This motor uses a heavy-duty motor that produces smooth rotation and pursues sound quality through a hearing test to minimize flutter components in the sense of hearing.<br><br>The mechanism uses a frequency distributed closed loop double capstan system.<br><br>It uses a silent mechanism with a dedicated motor and microprocessor to achieve quiet and stable operation.<br><br>Copper-tight (copper-plated) chassis is used to reduce magnetic distortion and resonance.<br><br>Dual mono configuration using oxygen-free copper pattern is adopted for the amplifier substrate.<br><br>Uses a oxygen-free copper AC power cord.<br><br>It is equipped with an acoustic insulator.<br><br>Equipped with Dolby B-CNR as a noise reduction system.<br><br>Equipped with an independent equalizer switch.<br><br>Equipped with a tape slack prevention mechanism.<br><br>Equipped with an output volume.<br><br>System remote terminal is mounted.<br><br>The headphone terminal is gold-plated.<br>Gold plated input / output terminals are also used for input / output terminals.<br><br>Gold plated oxygen-free copper pin cord is attached.<br><br>There are approximately 30 adjustment mechanisms inside, and by carefully adjusting all items in the manufacturing process, each individual error is pushed to the limit and excellent characteristics are acquired.<br>For example, a typical cassette deck has only one semi-fixed volume for bias adjustment for each L and R, so only one of the three tape positions can be adjusted accurately. On the other hand, the CR series has a total of six semi-fixed volumes for L and R. By pursuing the characteristics of all positions to the limit, excellent sound quality is obtained even in normal position.<br>In addition, 56 items of actual measurement of characteristics were carried out on a perfectly adjusted deck, and every item was strictly measured one by one, and only the individual which sufficiently satisfied the specification is shipped.</p>
