				<p class="detail">Double cassette deck with twin recording and re-reverse function.<br><br>Both the A and B decks are equipped with a laser amorphous recorder / rehead with LC-OFC winding.<br>In addition to high-speed dubbing, we have adopted a super-bias system that improves sound quality at normal speed.<br><br>Each A and B deck is equipped with a Dolby NR system. In normal speed mode, both decks can independently set three positions of B type / C type / OFF. This enables Cross Dolby NR dubbing, in which tapes recorded in C type are converted to B type and dubbed.<br>The dubbing level can also be adjusted during normal speed dubbing, allowing recording and fade-in / out to match the characteristics of the tape, such as when dubbing from a type IV metal position tape to a type I normal position tape.<br><br>It is equipped with a linear electronic counter with a minute-and-second subtraction function that independently counts the tape travel amount of each A/B deck. The approximate travel amount of each deck is displayed by A/B switching, and the tape travel amount of each deck can be checked during simultaneous recording or dubbing.<br><br>In addition to normal speed, it is possible to synchronize dubbing that matches the operation timing of A/B deck at high speed.<br><br>It is equipped with an auto pause function. When dubbing at normal speed, every time the B deck records one song, it waits in the recording pause. You can dubbing while selecting songs on the A deck.<br><br>When there is a no-signal portion of approximately 10 seconds or more during playback, it is fast-forwarded and played from the beginning of the next song. When this function is operated during normal speed dubbing, it is possible to create a dubbing tape in which the no-signal portion of approximately 10 seconds or more on the playback side is automatically shortened to approximately 5 seconds.<br>In addition, the AMS function allows you to find the beginning of the current or next song.<br><br>Equipped with a direction mode switch, you can select single-side recording / playback, double-side one cycle recording and continuous cycle playback in mode, A/B deck relay recording and continuous repeat playback.<br><br>A twin-lock cassette holding mechanism has been adopted to further improve the stability of tape travel, thereby reducing rattling and vibration of the half during tape travel.<br><br>Equipped with a direction indicator that displays the tape running status.<br><br>Equipped with a level meter by FL tube.<br><br>Equipped with quick auto-reverse function.<br><br>Equipped with autoplay function and counter-linked memory stop / play function.<br><br>Equipped with Type I/II/IV auto tape selector.<br><br>Equipped with Rec Mute function with auto space.<br><br>Timer sold separately allows recording of absence and alarm clock playback.<br><br>Equipped with a headphone port with variable output.<br><br>It comes with a wireless remote control that can operate both A and B decks.<br>In addition to basic operations, this remote control can be used to reset linear electronic counters, memory, A/B switching, etc. It can also be used in conjunction with Sony&#39;s remote-controlled CD player for wireless CD-synchronized recording using remote control.</p>
