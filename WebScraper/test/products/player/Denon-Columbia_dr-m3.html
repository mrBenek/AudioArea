				<p class="detail">A stereo cassette deck equipped with a computer tuning system.<br><br>Equipped with a computer tuning function, it automatically sets the optimum position for each tape out of 100,000 adjustments by pressing the start key.<br><br>The mechanism part uses a silent mechanism with reduced mechanical noise.<br>The silent mechanism eliminates the large mechanical sound of the plunger and uses a motor cam drive. In addition, the problem of tape overrun due to time lag in the motor cam drive has been solved by computer processing. The rotary encoder detects the position of the cam and applies digital feedback servo to achieve accurate rotational position control.<br>By reducing the slip between the capstan and pinch roller and improving the tape tension characteristics, we have achieved stable rotational accuracy and also pursued the accuracy of the capstan shaft.<br><br>It is equipped with DENON&#39;s own progress tension servo sensor in order to obtain appropriate back tension.<br>This keeps the back tension, which changes depending on the remaining amount of tape, constant, and realizes a stable touch to improve the level fluctuation and drop-out. In addition, the effect of the structure of the cassette half is eliminated.<br><br>The capstan motor uses a direct-drive servo motor.<br>This motor has a unique flat-faced design that provides strong rotational torque, eliminates uneven torque, and improves wow flutter. In addition, the brushless structure eliminates electrical noise and improves durability.<br>The servo circuit uses the all-round integral sample-and-hold method.<br><br>Non-slip reel drive system eliminates variations in winding force due to mechanical slip and changes in environmental conditions, thereby eliminating dropouts due to uneven winding, and deterioration of wow flutter and phase characteristics.<br><br>Uses SF (Super Frequency) combination head for recording and reproducing head.<br>This head combines a recording head designed to maximize the MOL of each tape with a reproducing head with improved high-frequency characteristics by using a newly developed ferrite material. It achieves wide and flat frequency characteristics and eliminates azimuth loss on the A/B surface of the tape. In addition, Sendust is used in the guard part to greatly improve abrasion resistance.<br>The SF head also uses oxygen-free copper wire for the coil to improve sound quality.<br><br>The power supply circuit completely separates the amplifier system from the logic system to eliminate mutual interference. The amplifier system uses an IPS (Independent Power Supply) system to stabilize the circuit.<br><br>The equalizer amplifier section employs a low-noise differential input push-pull DC amplifier circuit. The dynamic range is expanded by supplying a high-voltage power supply by ± 2 power supply system. In addition, the condenser between the head and the first stage amplifier is removed, and the DC amplifier is used up to the last stage to improve sound quality.<br>Newly developed transformer and push-pull configuration with high stability are adopted for the bias circuit, and erase noise is greatly reduced by improving bias waveform distortion.<br><br>Equipped with Dolby B Type and Dolby C Type as noise reduction system.<br>This circuit employs a newly developed IC for Dolby C-type, which expands the mix range of the Dolby unit completely directly connected to the Dolby unit, and the transient characteristics are also greatly improved by adopting a full-wave rectifier circuit.<br>In addition, the double-Dolby system enables Dolby playback during simultaneous recording and monitoring.<br><br>Equipped with MPX filter, it can cut out 19 kHz pilot signal of FM broadcasting.<br><br>Equipped with a computer counter, two types of displays are possible : one is to display the remaining amount of tape and the other is an electronic counter.<br>Taking into consideration the fluctuation of the remaining time due to the difference in the hub size and tape thickness of the cassette half, 3 types of selector switches, large hub C46, C4c46-C60, and C90.<br><br>You can adjust the volume of the headphones and control the output level.<br><br>Equipped with timer Play/Rec mechanism. By combining with a separately sold timer, it is possible to record absence and play an alarm.<br><br>A one touch rec-pause mechanism is adopted, and recording standby can be performed just by pressing the REC button.<br><br>The FL peak meter is mounted on the display.<br>The FL meter has a centralized display of Dolby B &amp; C, tape source and tape position, and the DR-M3 meter has a 1.5 second peak hold function.<br><br>It uses a Pause/Mute mechanism that combines Rec Mute and Pause to improve operability.<br>During recording, press and hold to set Rec Mute, release to set Pause, and press the Play switch again to return to the recording mode.<br><br>Equipped with a follow-up recording mechanism, you can change from a regenerating condition with the tape running to a recording state with one touch operation.<br><br>Equipped with remote control terminal, Wired Remote Control RC-57 can be used.</p>
