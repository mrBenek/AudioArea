				<p class="detail">Twin re-quick reverse deck with Dolby S NR mounted on both A and B decks.<br><br>Recording on two tapes at the same time, recording on both sides of the A deck is carried over to the B deck, and relay recording for long duration recording can be performed. In addition, it is equipped with a quick reverse mechanism that reduces sound loss when the tape is reversed.<br><br>As a noise reduction system, Dolby S NR is independently mounted on the A/B deck.<br><br>The A-deck features wide-range pitch control, allowing you to adjust the tape speed to within ± 30% during playback.<br><br>Equipped with an RMS (Random Music Sensor) function for 28 songs (14 songs on one side) that can be easily edited from A deck to B deck by changing the order of songs. The order of songs is programmed on the A deck on the playback side, and music selection starts with a single button. When a song is found, recording on B deck starts, and during the start of the next song, it goes into a standby state with recording pause.<br><br>Equipped with high-speed dubbing function, dubbing is possible in half the time.<br><br>Vibration is absorbed by using fine ceramic composite material for the cassette holder, and accuracy is improved by using aluminum extruding material for the cassette lid.<br><br>It is equipped with a cassette stabilizer, and at the same time as the tape is loaded, the stabilizer inside the cassette door fixes the half and suppresses vibration of the tape.<br><br>Uses PC-OCC wound laser amorphous head with high-purity oxygen-free copper PC-OCC for the head winding.<br><br>Dolby HX-PRO is installed independently on both decks.<br>By controlling the bias current in increments of one thousandth of a second according to the frequency and level of the signal, the linearity of the high-frequency range is kept good.<br><br>By using a super-bias with a bias frequency of 160 kHz, the frequency of the bias signal is separated from the audio signal band to reduce interference caused by the bias to the audio signal.<br><br>Both decks are equipped with an auto-calibration system that automatically adjusts the bias amount and recording level according to the characteristics of the magnetic material different for each tape.<br><br>It is equipped with sound auto-focus and the recording level setting is controlled by microcomputer.<br>This feature detects the presence or absence of tape position or Dolby NR, and automatically adjusts the recording level according to the input level to reduce level over failures.<br><br>Equipped with FL linear counter equipped with subtraction function.<br><br>Equipped with a fader button, you can fade in and fade out with a single button when recording.<br>It also supports recording with a timer (sold separately).<br><br>Equipped with multi-AMS, it is possible to quickly start up to 30 songs before and after based on the song being played.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
