				<p class="detail">CD player equipped with newly developed hybrid pulse D/A converter.<br><br>The D/A converter is equipped with a newly developed hybrid pulse D/A converter that uses Sony&#39;s unique noise-shaping method.<br>This circuit improves the signal-to-noise ratio by incorporating a noise-shaping digital filter that performs high-precision oversampling operation in the D/A converter itself. At the same time, the signal path is simplified by using a single chip, and signal degradation due to jitter is minimized by improving the function of the direct digital sink formed on the same chip.<br><br>It is equipped with a direct digital sink and the master clock is formed on the same chip as the pulse D/A converter. This allows the electronic switch of the pulse D/A converter to be turned on and off more accurately, eliminating harmful jitter and reducing sound quality degradation.<br><br>The servo circuit uses a high-precision digital servo.<br>In this circuit, the signal from the optical pickup is A/D converted, filtered and controlled by digital processing, and then D/A converted again to operate the optical pickup, making it possible to adjust the servo amount according to each disc.<br>The high-precision servo uses a high-sampling rate, high-precision, high-resolution A/D converter and D/A converter to realize a more ideal servocontrol and low power consumption by digitizing.<br><br></p>

            <p class="detail">It has a custom edit function and eight functions : peak search, time edit, just edit, link edit, program edit, time fade, variable fade, and manual fader.<br><br>In peak search, all songs are searched at high speed, and they are repeatedly played for about 4 seconds before and after the point where the volume level is highest.<br><br>Time Edit enables efficient editing of the A-side and B-side when recording tapes.<br>If you want to edit to fit the length of your tape, use the TIME SET button or AMS button to set the length of the tape (you can also use the direct key to set the length in seconds). Press the Edit button. First, program from the first song for side A. When you encounter a time-over song, select the longest song that fits within the time. Then press the Edit button to edit side B.<br>Also, if you select and edit a half disk with the AMS button, tracks are distributed so that the A side and B side of the tape are about the same length without changing the order of the songs.<br><br>Just Edit automatically finds and programs the combination of songs that is closest to the specified time.<br>Use the Time Set button or AMS button to enter the length of the tape, press the Edit button to select the length of the A side, press the Edit button again to select the length of the B side. You can also program the songs you want to keep in advance and just edit them with the remaining time.<br><br>Link Edit is used when a large number of tapes are left over during Time Edit or Just Edit. The track number of the song to be included in the remaining time and the LINK display blink, and you can add a song by selecting from the blinking track number again.<br>Link-edit also allows you to swap disks and continue the edit.<br><br>Program Edit allows you to manually edit your favorite songs in any order.<br>Use the AMS key or direct key to program your favorite songs in the desired order while checking the accumulated time. Press the pause button to program the A side and then the B side together.<br><br>Time Fade allows you to fade out at a specified time, which can be set with the TIME SET button or the AMS button.<br><br>You can set the fade-in / fade-out time for the variable fade from 2 seconds to 10 seconds in units of 1 second.<br><br>The manual fader allows you to fade in and fade out at the desired location.<br><br></p>

            <p class="detail">The DSP (Digital Signal Processing) function allows you to add reflected and reverberant sounds that create a surround sound effect through digital signal processing to the music signal and play it back. There are seven types of sound fields, including a hall, church, jazz club, stadium, dance / disco, lybloom, and soft / background music. You can also adjust the equalizer (pitch) and reverb (reverberation level) to your preference in each DSP mode.<br>Digital output is not available for the DSP function.<br><br>With the Delete Play function for 99 songs, you can keep only the songs you want to listen to and play them continuously. If you delete unnecessary songs in shuffle mode and then switch to continue mode, you can skip the songs and play them.<br>In addition, it is equipped with a 99 track delete shuffle function so that you can leave only your favorite music and play it randomly.<br><br>Equipped with Auto Q, you can search automatically to the point where the sound rises in the pause state.<br><br>It is equipped with an autospace function, and there is a silent space of about 3 seconds between songs, and when playing a disc with more than 3 seconds between songs, it is shortened to 3 seconds at the shortest.<br>During custom edit, the time is calculated by adding 3 seconds for each song.<br><br>It is equipped with functions such as a program performance function of up to 24 songs, 6-mode repeat of one song / all songs / program / delete play / shuffle / delete shuffle, AMS for quick cue of a song, and music search for fast forward / backward while listening to a song.<br><br>The display section has a 20-track music calendar.<br><br>Equipped with a display mode function, it is possible to switch all / partial ON / OFF.<br>The dimmer function allows you to change the brightness of the display to three levels.<br><br>Equipped with an optical digital output.<br><br>Equipped with two line outputs, fixed and variable.<br>In addition, it is equipped with a headphone terminal with a lineout linked volume that flashes when the remote control is operated.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
