				<p class="detail">This 3-head stereo cassette deck was developed using various technologies such as 3-motor, 3-head, triple noise reduction, Dolby HX, etc.<br><br>A closed-loop dual capstan system is used for the mechanism.<br>In order to ensure constant tape travel tension, we have adopted a dual capstan system in which the capstan and pinch rollers firmly hold the tape and drive it. This system achieves stable travel. In addition, by changing the diameter of each pinch roller, we have dispersed the wow / flutter cycle. In order to smoothly absorb small vibrations, we have adopted oil-impregnated plastic for the pinch roller bearings. In addition, by etching the capstan in sub-micron order to prevent tape slippage, we have improved the wow / flutter and reduced modulation noise.<br>A large flywheel (complete mass : 1100g ・ cm) shall be attached to the capstan shaft.<sup>2</sup>x2) to further enhance the stability.<br><br>It is equipped with E ・ M (Electro Mganetic) hysteresis tension servo developed by TEAC in order to aim at further stable driving.<br>This system is the first in the world to be equipped with an electromagnetic hysteresis coupling for back tension control, enabling excellent tension characteristics equivalent to 4D. D.<br>This E ・ M hysteresis tension servo is an electromagnetic non-contact brake that is essentially different from commonly used friction brakes. It has little torque fluctuation and does not vary with temperature or humidity. In addition, the I. R. (infrared ray) photo-reflector detects the rotation speed of the reel and changes the current in the coil, so that constant tape tension is always obtained.<br>In addition, a newly developed Fe-Mn semi-hardened magnetic material is used as a magnetic material to obtain the most effective brake torque and achieve a certain level of tape tension.<br><br>A 3-motor system is adopted to realize 3S (Soft, Smooth, Silent).<br>By using a dedicated motor for capstan drive, reel drive, and mechanism, stable driving and silent mechanism are realized.<br><br>The head uses an independently suspended combination 3-head system, which provides the best azimuth accuracy for both the recording head and the reproducing head, and greatly improves the high-frequency and phase characteristics, which greatly affect the sound quality.<br>The V-970X further integrates three heads for recording, playback, and erasing, and stores them in a precision large zinc die-cast head base, improving the accuracy of head position and achieving stable tape travel and accurate and uniform head touch.<br>In addition, we have adopted a cobalt-amorphous (CA) head that uses LC-OFC (first class oxygen-free copper, purity 99.995%) winding that improves transmission characteristics. This head uses thin foil that is unique to amorphous alloys with no crystal structure. It has a 13-layer laminate structure that is approximately four times that of conventional Sendust heads. The ribbon-shaped amorphous alloy greatly reduces eddy current loss. This results in improved MOL with excellent magnetic characteristics, flat high-frequency characteristics, and high wear resistance without grain boundary peeling.<br><br>In the power supply circuit, the Rec, PB, and NR sections are each divided into blocks to completely separate the power supply for the amplifier system from the power supply for the mechanism system. In addition, the winding of the transformer is completely separated to prevent deterioration of sound quality due to mutual noise interference.<br>The ± 2 power supply system clarifies the ground potential, reduces system noise and improves the S / N ratio, and also improves the response characteristics and distortion factor.<br><br>In order to eliminate the effect of the condenser, the head and amplifier are directly connected and the condenser is eliminated.<br><br>By integrating most of the amplifier system from the input to the output of the signal into a single circuit board, we aim at 3S (Simple, Straight, Small).<br>In addition, the display and switches are connected directly to the board to prevent noise and reduce the length of wires. In addition, LC-OFC, which improves transmission characteristics, is used for the signal lead wires. In addition, parts such as aluminum electrolytic capacitors and film capacitors exclusively for audio, which are digital compatible and designed for high sound quality, are used to minimize signal degradation.<br><br>Equipped with triple noise reduction (dbx, Dolby B/C).<br>The dbxNR mounted on the V-970X uses an integrated L/R symmetrical one chip LSI to eliminate component variations and minimize degradation of sound quality. The encoding and decoding of dbxNR realizes an NR effect of 30 to 40 dB in the entire audible band, and the dynamic range of 110 dB, which exceeds the limit of cassette tapes.<br>In addition, the Dolby B/C NR uses a highly reliable one chip LSI to enhance compatibility with other decks.<br><br>Equipped with Dolby HX Pro, which enhances the ability of high-frequency characteristics.<br>The Dolby HX Pro has a feature that prevents the high-frequency signal applied to the recording head from operating as a bias when recording a deck. It detects the component of the signal above 10 kHz and automatically controls it to reduce the bias when it is large, thereby improving the high-frequency reduction in high-level recording. This enables recording of ordinary tapes in the same manner as tapes with excellent high-frequency characteristics.<br>Tapes recorded with Dolby HX Pro can also be played back by devices that do not have Dolby HX Pro. Since this circuit operates only during recording, no processing is required during playback.<br><br>In order to optimize recording conditions that vary slightly depending on the tape being used, a BIAS &amp; LEVEL manual modulation mechanism is installed.<br>The BIAS transmitter contains a master oscillator and a BIAS amplifier, which are also used in professional mTRs. The LEVEL can be controlled by ± 3 dB and the BIAS by ± 20%.<br><br>In order to realize highly accurate control, two dedicated microcomputers are installed.<br>First, the system control LSI determines the operation mode by judging various input states and transmits it to the mechanism control. In addition, the system control LSI reliably controls counter display, memory operation and CPS.<br>The mechanism control LSI controls the CAM motor to the specified position, controls the REEL motor, controls the amplifier control output, and displays the operation mode.<br><br>In addition to the L/R, a new master volume is installed so that accurate volume adjustment can be performed.<br>As a result, the operability is improved compared with the balance method and the L/R volume method in which the R image lowers when the L is raised.<br><br>Equipped with a CD level check function, you can check the level of the entire song while the CD player is fast-forwarded.<br>Normally, the CD player is fast-forwarded with the upper body lowered by 12 dB. This is returned to the original level and displayed on the meter to enable accurate monitoring.<br><br>Equipped with an auto monitor mechanism that automates the switching between tape monitor and source monitor.<br><br>Equipped with an auto tape selector that automatically detects Normal/CrO2/Metal.<br><br>It is equipped with a CPS system that searches and plays one song from the current song to the 15th song before and after it.<br><br>It is equipped with a CDS system that searches for and plays back any songs from the beginning of the cassette.<br><br>It is equipped with a block repeat function to repeat playback between two points.<br><br>Equipped with 4-mode (tape counter / tape run timer / CPS count / CDS count) switching multi-electronic counter.<br><br>Equipped with FL multi-function display controlled by microprocessor.<br><br>Equipped with an MPX filter switch.<br><br>Uses gold-plated input / output terminals.<br><br>Memory Stop / Memory Boost is available at any position.<br><br>Equipped with an auto rec mute function of approximately 4 seconds.<br><br>Wireless remote controller with 16 function keys is included.</p>
