				<p class="detail">Stereo cassette deck with built-in Dolby system as noise reduction equipment.<br><br>Equipped with the Dolby system, it reduces hissing, which is the biggest problem of the tape.<br>This is a method that automatically raises the recording level when the noise and signal level difference is small and the tape hiss is harsh pianissimo, and lowers the tape hiss by returning it to the same level as the source at the time of playback. The operation is performed in the frequency band of medium sound or higher where noise is especially noticeable in the audibility.<br>All is done by electronic circuit, and S/N is improved without losing sound quality.<br>You can use both normal tape and chrome tape by simply pressing the Dolby button during recording and playback.<br><br>Equipped with a tape selector to make best use of chrome tape.<br>The one touch changeover switch allows you to choose between normal and chrome tapes. Especially for chrome tapes, you can enjoy hi-fi recording and playback with built-in Dolby system and ferrite solid head.<br><br>Ferrite solid head is used for the head. This head has semi-permanent wear resistance when used for a cassette deck. It also has excellent high-frequency characteristics with little magnetic loss for recording.<br>The contact surface with the tape is carefully mirror-finished to prevent sound skipping due to dust adhesion and noise generation due to magnetization.<br><br>It features a unique pattern of rotating tape running pilots that indicate tape running conditions.<br>Rotates according to the direction of tape travel, and the pattern turns red in the recording state.<br><br>A DC motor is used.<br>In addition, the rotation control circuit, which consists of transistors and diodes, operates stably against fluctuations in the power supply voltage and changes in the load due to tape running, achieving excellent characteristics.<br><br>Equipped with a warning peak indicator to prevent distortion of sound caused by over recording level.<br>It uses a light emitting diode, and the sensitivity is sharp by the meter pointer of the mechanical operation. It lights up immediately and warns even the instantaneous input over.<br><br>Equipped with a memory rewind switch.<br>When recording or playing from the middle of a tape, this switch is turned ON and the tape counter is set to &quot;000&quot;. When the tape is rewound, it automatically stops at &quot;999&quot; which is one position before the tape.<br><br>It has a skip button that you can press during playback to send the tape faster (approximately twice as fast) while monitoring the sound.<br><br>Built-in level control for recording and playback is independent, so you can match the level with the tuner and player.<br>The playback level control can also be used to adjust the level when playing only through headphones.<br><br>Equipped with a non-contact type auto-stop mechanism that automatically returns the head and pinch roller to the stop position as soon as the tape is wound.<br>It protects the important mechanism as well as preventing deformation of the tape and one end of the tape.</p>
