				<p class="detail">A stereo cassette deck equipped with Computer Brain, DX3 head and Dolby C type.<br><br>Compu-Brain, a computer-based automatic tape tuning system, is installed to draw out the performance of the tape used.<br>The Compu-Brain is a system that automatically adjusts the bias recording sensitivity (CAL) and equalizer. When the Compu-Brain is activated before recording starts, it detects and sets the optimum bias recording sensitivity and equalizer value for the tape to be used in approximately 16 seconds. Each adjustment step is determined in 32 steps, and the adjustment value is selected from more than 30000 combinations.<br>The Compu-Brain is equipped with a last data memory that stores the latest adjustment data for approximately 24 hours. This memory can be used even when you are away.<br><br>The head part uses a combination DX head developed from the 3-head system.<br>In the DX head, the eddy current loss is reduced by laminating six cores in multiple layers, and the frequency characteristic is extended to the high range. In addition, the undulation of the frequency characteristic in the low range due to the contour effect observed in the conventional combination head has been improved. In addition, the wear resistance is improved by using Sendust for the guard part and a hard composite material for the core spacer.<br><br>As a noise reduction system, in addition to Dolby B type, Dolby C type is also installed.<br>The Dolby C type has a built-in anti-sound circuit that improves the high-frequency saturation characteristics of the tape by approximately 4 dB at 10 kHz and by approximately 8 dB at 15 kHz. It also eliminates the adverse effect on sound quality caused by the increase in noise improvement, such as the saturation phenomenon.<br><br>Equipped with ADMS (Automatic Demagnetizing System) which is an automatic demagnetizing system, demagnetizing can be performed by simple operation, and magnetization of the head can be prevented.<br><br>The mechanism part uses a super-stabilized torsion dual capstan system.<br>In this system, the capstan on the take-up side is specially treated by micrograin processing to reduce slip between the capstan and the pinch roller.<br><br>Equipped with a 4-digit electronic counter using a fluorescent display tube.<br>In addition to operating as a normal counter, this counter also has a tape time display function that displays the total recording and playback time of the tape in minutes and seconds during recording and playback.<br>In addition, by combining with Counter &quot;0000&quot; Play (Stop) and Repeat mechanism, tape play such as repeat performance between any two points is possible.<br><br>Equipped with a Rec mute mechanism that allows you to create unrecorded portions between songs.<br>During recording, press the Rec-Mute key to create an unrecorded portion for approximately four seconds and then automatically enter the Pause state. If you want to cancel Rec-Mute within four seconds, press the Rec-Mute key again to cancel and continue recording. If you want to create an unrecorded portion for more than four seconds, press and hold the Rec-Mute key for as long as necessary.<br><br>Equipped with a 3-color 16-point peak program meter. Fast response speed and equipped with a Oatley set type peak hold mechanism for reliable level monitoring.<br><br>It is equipped with 100 mm long stroke slide volume.<br><br>Equipped with 4-stage tape selector of LH, FeCr, CrO2, Metal.<br><br>It has a queue and review mechanism.<br><br>Equipped with an ON/OFF capable MPX filter to prevent Dolby malfunction due to pilot signal of FM broadcasting.<br><br>Equipped with timer standby mechanism, and by using a timer sold separately, it is possible to record absence and play alarm clock.<br><br>The microphone terminal is mounted on the back.<br><br>Wireless remote control unit or remote control unit sold separately can be used.</p>
