				<p class="detail">This is a stereo cassette deck that pursues the ultimate in cassette using Akai&#39;s unique technologies such as Super GX3 head and Quartz Lock 2 Motor DD system.<br><br>The Super GX3 head system is mounted on the head part.<br>It is a REC/PB combination type that uses High and High μ ferrite material and separate recording head (4 μ gap) and reproducing head (1 μ gap). In addition to excellent characteristics, it also has excellent secondary characteristics such as abrasion resistance, little noise, and dust resistance. It brings out the performance of various tapes including metal tapes.<br><br>The most reliable 2-motor system is used for the drive system.<br>Especially for the capstan drive, a high-grade original brushless quartz-lock DD motor is used. Strong torque and excellent rotational accuracy are realized by a three phase full-wave drive system with Hall element position detection and FG servo + quartz-lock circuit with high accuracy and quick response.<br>In addition, in order to stabilize high rotational accuracy, it is equipped with a quartz lock, which is phase control by crystal oscillation, and it is combined with a direct drive mechanism to maintain high accuracy.<br><br>The recording amplifier uses a DC amplifier to minimize distortion during recording, and the playback amplifier uses a dual FET.<br><br>By using computer control with two microcomputers, performance degradation due to wear is reduced by reducing noise and mechanical switching mechanism in operation timing and start-up during recording, and by improving various mechanisms such as auto-tuning, excellent recording and playback are realized.<br><br>Equipped with an auto-tuning mechanism that has been developed to extract 100% of the characteristics of various tapes and to record and reproduce them under optimum conditions.<br>A microcomputer mounted on the deck analyzes the characteristics of each tape and commands the deck for the optimum bias equalizer and recording sensitivity. In particular, the auto-tuning mechanism of the GX-F95 employs an independent double tuning method in which the equalizer and recording sensitivity are tuned twice for each side (bias is applied twice for each side simultaneously).<br>When tuning, a method is used to avoid the beginning of winding where the tape characteristics are unstable by automatically fast-forwarding.<br><br>Equipped with an automatic tape position selector mechanism, the deck detects the type of tape set at the same time as the tape set switches the tape position.<br><br>Equipped with an electronic digital tape counter.<br><br>It is equipped with a recording cancellation mechanism. If you make a mistake in timing by CM, etc., it will automatically return to the head of the recording section and enter the standby state.<br><br>Each operation state such as Play/FF/RWD/REC/PAUSE can be checked with the self-illuminated button.<br>The function indicator displays the operation of each mechanism in a centralized manner.<br><br>Equipped with 2-color 24-segment FL bar meter with peak hold.<br>The peak hold time is approximately one second, and a VU / peak switching switch is installed.<br><br>Two types of cassette lids are included. In addition to the aluminum type, there is also an acrylic type that shows the tape running.<br><br>Equipped with recording mute mechanism, microphone / line mixing mechanism, Dolby NR with MPX filter switch, etc.<br><br>Equipped with remote control terminal and timer mechanism.<br><br>There were 2 types, GX-F95 of walkers or rollators for the elderly type and GX-F95BL of black type.</p>
