				<p class="detail">A CD-player using 1-bit Mash system.<br><br>1 bitMASH system is adopted for D/A conversion part.<br>The 1-bit Mash is based on a clock generated by ultra-precision crystal oscillation. While the vertical axis (amplitude axis) is fixed at 1 bit, the horizontal axis (time axis) is highly accurate. This realizes the noise-shaping system, which is a D/A conversion system with excellent differential linearity and very little gradation error.<br>In the CD-P400, this 1-bit Mash eliminates the 0 cross distortion and achieves excellent linearity at low levels. In addition, quantization noise is minimized in the audible band, ensuring excellent S/N ratio.<br><br>A midship mounting system is adopted in which the entire mechanism is placed in the center of the housing.<br>As a result, the transformer with a large weight mass is positioned in the center of the body and moved to the back panel side at the same time. The internal layout completely separates the servo system (digital) from the audio system (analog) through the mechanism to achieve a symmetrical layout. In addition, the center of mass and massive parts are placed as close as possible to ensure an ideal chassis balance. This prevents interference between the left and right circuits and greatly improves durability.<br>In addition, a foot base containing special glass fiber with low vibration mode is adopted for the mechanical base, and a highly rigid mechanical system is formed by the three point support which is strong against torsion, and vibration and resonance are completely eliminated. In addition, it has the effect of stabilizing tracing capability and servo.<br><br>The servo mechanism is equipped with a newly developed CN servo.<br>In the conventional servo mechanism, when the servo amount is too large, the disturbance of the current forms a noise component, which adversely affects the analog system. In the CN servo, unnecessary noise components other than the servo current are filtered using a low-pass filter to filter the driving voltage to the actuator, thereby dramatically reducing the servo current.<br><br>Equipped with TEAC&#39;s original T. F. H. S. (Track &amp; Focus Holding System).<br>TFHS accurately reads the tracking error signal (up and down) and the focus error signal (left and right) when there is a scratch or dirt on the disk surface. The pickup maintains the trace signal just before the scratch or dirt as it is. After passing through the scratch or dirt, it immediately starts to accurately read the pits of the same track. This prevents sound skipping and ensures stable pickup ability even against black dots.<br>By installing this mechanism, stable pit reading and high-precision tracing capability are obtained at any position from the inner circumference to the outer circumference of any disk, and the amount of change in servo current is greatly reduced.<br><br>In order to eliminate the effects of vibration and resonance, the front panel is made of drawn aluminum material with sufficient thickness and weight, and it is joined to the bonnet made of PVC thick steel plate as a double structure. In addition, the tray top panel and the front panel are flush surfaces with no steps to cope with air vibration from the front, back, and left and right.<br>In addition, only the necessary keys are placed on the front and the opening is minimized to eliminate the influence of sound pressure.<br><br>Equipped with editing function convenient for cassette editing.<br>You can display the accumulated time every time you program a song you want to record. It is also equipped with a pause program mechanism that allows you to program poses.<br><br>It is equipped with index search, random memory program of up to 20 songs, delete program, music scan and music search.<br><br>Equipped with a cue lock function, you can search for music without holding down the fast forward or fast return buttons.<br><br>Equipped with four types of repeat functions : one track, all tracks, programs, and between A and B.<br><br>Equipped with 3-mode time counter.<br><br>Equipped with an auto space function that can set the interval between songs of about 4 seconds.<br><br>Equipped with a timer play function, you can start playing from the desired time by combining with an optional timer.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
