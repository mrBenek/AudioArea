				<p class="detail">Cassette deck without monitor function from 582Z.<br><br>On the 581Z, the Dolby NR processor and its peripheral circuits are used for both recording and playback.<br>Although after-monitoring is not available, you can directly read the playback level with the level meter when recording the test tone.<br><br>For all high-performance tapes, it features 15 kHz and 400 Hz test tones, independent left / right calibration for each tape position, and an LED peak level meter that acts as a calibration meter for accurate and severe calibration.<br><br>The L and R channels has an independent bias calibration function.<br>A 15 kHz test tone is used for the bias adjustment. When the Tone switch is set to the 15 kHz position, a 15 kHz (-20dB) test tone is output from the built-in oscillator and recorded on the tape. The level meter is replaced with a bias adjustment meter and displays approximately 0 dB for high sensitivity. The scale is also expanded to 1 dB per step for easy adjustment.<br>Record the test tone while watching the display of this meter. Turn the bias adjustment volume independent on the left and right that matches the tape position used by EX (normal type), SX (CrO2 type) and ZX (metal type) to adjust both L and R to 0 dB. Then the adjustment is completed.<br><br>The L/R channel is equipped with independent recording and playback level calibration function.<br>A 400 Hz test tone is used to adjust the recording and playback level. When the Tone switch is set to the 400 Hz position, the built-in oscillator outputs a 400 Hz (0 dB) test tone, which is recorded on the tape. At this time, the level meter changes to the recording and playback level meter, and the scale is expanded to 1 dB per step for easy adjustment.<br>Record a test tone while watching this meter, and turn the L/R independent recording and playback level adjustment volume that matches the tape position so that both L and R are adjusted to 0 dB. Then the adjustment is completed.<br><br>The level meter uses a 50-dB full-scale wide-range peak level meter that displays -40dB to + 10 dB in 16 segments. This level meter is digital with LED and has excellent response with no overshoot. When the Tone switch is set to the 400 Hz or 15 kHz position, the meter is used as an adjustment meter for calibration and the indication value is enlarged for easy adjustment.<br><br>As a noise reduction system, Dolby C type and B type are mounted.<br>The operation principle of the C-type is basically the same as that of the B-type. By amplifying and recording only the low level signal in the middle and high range of which hissing is a concern for audibility, and returning it to the original level during playback, the hissing attached to the tape is suppressed. The C-type is equipped with two noise reduction processors, a high level stage and a low level stage, and achieves a total noise reduction of up to 20 dB.<br>In addition, the C-type uses a sliding band method that varies the starting frequencies according to the input levels and frequencies, reducing the bleeding phenomenon. In addition, the spectral skewing circuit reduces the recording saturation of high-frequency signals above 8 kHz, eliminating the degradation of saturation characteristics and preventing low-frequency signals from being modulated. In addition, the anti-frequency network circuit reduces the recording saturation caused by large instantaneous inputs.<br><br>The head section uses a discrete three head system in which the recording, reproducing and erasing heads are completely separated from each other in terms of structure.<br>A playback head and recording head are placed in the center window of the cassette, and an erase head is placed in the left side small window. Both are placed between the double capstans. The stable tape tension ensures head touch without spacing loss.<br><br>A P-8L-type playhead is used as the playhead.<br>This head uses a laminated core made of crystalline material, with a narrow gap of 0.6 microns to prevent loss during playback and improve frequency characteristics. In addition, a shape that eliminates low-frequency waviness (contour effect) enables flat playback to the ultra-low frequency range.<br>In addition, by adopting a special shape that eliminates the phenomenon of unbalanced core, a long life of over 10,000 hours has been realized.<br><br>The recording head uses an R-8L catalogue sound head.<br>Similar to the reproducing head, this head uses a laminated core of crystalloid. With a 3.5 micron gap, it has a high coercive force and a sharp critical zone even when high-density tapes are used. In addition, no magnetostriction or saturation occurs even when a large bias current is applied, making it possible to record high MOL (maximum output level) from low to high range.<br>As with the reproducing head, the life of the head is over 10,000 hours.<br><br>E-8L-type erase head is used for the erase head.<br>This head is a double-gap type using a ferrite core with excellent high-frequency characteristics and a Sendust core with high magnetic flux density at the tip, and achieves low loss and excellent erasing efficiency.<br><br>The mechanism uses a frequency distributed double capstan system.<br>In this system, stable tape running and stable head touch are obtained by the double capstan system, and adverse effects due to uneven pad pressure are prevented by the tape pad lifter. In addition, by changing the diameters of the capstan and the fly-wheel, the frequency-distributed system avoids overlapping of the flutter cycle and reduces rotational unevenness and modulation noise.<br><br>A PLL servo motor is used as the drive motor.<br>This motor detects rotational speed fluctuations and controls the rotational speed accurately by comparing the phase with the signal of the reference signal oscillator, enabling high-precision rotation.<br><br>The chassis uses a resonance damping type chassis. Aluminum alloy, which has a larger damping property than iron, is used. Resin out-isted to absorb harmful microvibration and prevent resonance.<br><br>The mechanism is controlled by C-MOS logic control and a silent mechanism driven by a motor.<br>When the control button is pressed, a logic circuit operates and the mechanism is operated by a control motor. The 582Z uses a cam driven by a motor without using a solenoid plunger. This reduces sound at the time of operation and allows soft contact with the tape, resulting in less damage to the tape and transport, less temperature rise, and less power consumption.<br><br>The recording equalizer circuit, playback equalizer circuit, and output line amplifier circuit are double-NF circuits that apply negative feedback to the electrolytic capacitor. This reduces distortion caused by the capacitor and stabilizes direct current.<br>In addition, the recording equalizer amplifier and recording head are directly connected, and the coupling capacitor is eliminated to improve the characteristics such as reducing distortion during recording and preventing phase shift in the low-frequency range.<br><br>It can be reflected directly in the regenerating condition without going through Stop after rewind.<br><br>It is equipped with the Easy Queuing function. If you press the Pause / Queue button during FF or Rew, the speed will be reduced to about 1/3 and you can listen to the recorded content. If you continue to press the FF or Rew button, the speed will be reduced to about 1/5 and you can easily start the track.<br><br>The Rec Mute function is installed. If you press the Rec button during recording, the input signal will be cut as long as you hold it down, creating a silent recording section (blank).<br><br>Built-in MPX filter.<br><br>Equipped with a timer recording and playback mechanism. By using an audio timer, it is possible to record absence and play an alarm clock.<br><br>Equipped with a high-output headphone port.<br><br>Compatible with optional Remote Control Unit RM-200.<br>RM-200 allows for normal tape operation and remote control such as queuing and rec mute.</p>
