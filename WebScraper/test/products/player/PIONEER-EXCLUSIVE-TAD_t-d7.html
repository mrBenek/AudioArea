				<p class="detail">A three head cassette deck equipped with a digital processing system.<br><br>A digital processing system is used for signal processing inside the deck.<br>In this method, the music signal read by the playback head is converted into a digital music signal, and the subsequent signal processing is done by digital processing with little degradation, thereby suppressing degradation caused by high-frequency correction and level correction.<br>In addition, it is equipped with a Legato link conversion, which is also installed in CD players. It reproduces music signals in the audible band above 20 kHz by estimating them from signals within the audible band and 1/f characteristics, and realizes wide-band playback up to 40 kHz.<br><br>Digital noise reduction is installed in the digital circuit.<br>In this circuit, the audio frequency band is divided into multiple bands by a digital filter, and the hissing is separated and removed by increasing the level difference between the music signal and noise, thereby achieving an S/N ratio of 90 dB when the Dolby NR is on.<br>This digital noise reduction does not need to be encoded at the time of recording, and is capable of high S/N playback on tapes recorded on other decks or in the past.<br><br>Equipped with digital FLEX (Frequency Level Expander).<br>This function is used for tapes that are muffled due to degradation of high-frequency sound quality. This function automatically adjusts the high-frequency level to the 1/f characteristic so that even tapes with poor high-frequency characteristics can be played with clear sound.<br><br>Equipped with a digital XD (Extended Dynamic Range) FLAT System.<br>With this circuit, the recording and playback frequency characteristics can be tuned to a flat level by digital processing with one touch according to the tape to be used. By checking the high-frequency recording characteristics of the tape to be used with a computer and carrying out bias control that is optimal for the tape, higher precision correction capability and a wide dynamic range in the high-frequency range can be obtained.<br><br>The digital input terminal allows recording from digital devices with an optical output at a sampling frequency of 44.1 kHz. The T-D7 also has a digital input terminal on the front.<br>In addition, it is equipped with a digital sync function so that recording starts automatically when a music signal is input.<br><br>Equipped with digital ALCA (Auto Level Control with Tape Analysis) function.<br>When recording with digital input, the recording level can be automatically adjusted to the optimum level. The peak and initial recording levels are set based on the bias and sensitivity analysis of the FLAT SYSTEM and the high-frequency and high-level recording capability analysis, and the recording level is set according to the input signal. Thus, even tapes with different characteristics can be recorded at the appropriate recording level.<br>Manual operation is required for analog input.<br><br>The Z-concept has been adopted to reduce waveform distortion and pursue accurate signal transmission.<br>The T-D7 employs three technologies : a stayable detection based on the Z-concept, an accurate transmission, and a jitter-free conversion.<br><br>A cassette stabilizer, digital tension servo and, and a wing chassis are used for Stable Detection.<br>The cassette stabilizer is equipped with a special stabilizer of approximately 70g on the receiver side of the main body to effectively hold the cassette half with a soft touch. This reduces the influence of motor rotation vibration, sound pressure, and external vibration, and realizes stable driving and clear sound with less modulation noise.<br>In the Digital Tension Servo, the microcomputer controls the voltage of the reel motor according to the size of the wound diameter of the tape, and the tape is wound at the appropriate tape tension. This improves the wow flutter at the beginning of the winding of the tape, which has tended to be unstable in the past.<br>In the wing chassis, the shape of the bottom plate of the power transformer mounting part and the cassette mechanical mounting part is devised. By effectively releasing vibration to the outside from the insulator, the circuit board is isolated from the rotational vibration of the power transformer and motor.<br><br>The Accurate Transmission uses a high-speed active servo regulator that consists of a transformer winding dedicated to the amplifier in the amplifier power supply circuit. This high-speed servo stabilizes power supply voltage fluctuations caused by load fluctuations. It can also quickly follow sudden fluctuations in music signals, and record and play back sources with a wide dynamic range more faithfully.<br><br>The jitter-free conversion employs a switched-capacitor filter in the DAC to attenuate out-of-band noise and improve accuracy due to clock jitter.<br><br>The Dolby B/C type and Dolby HX-PRO are installed as noise reduction systems.<br><br>Equipped with power loading / ejection and time counter (elapsed time of recording and re-recording) functions.<br><br>Equipped with a 4-digit electronic counter and tape remaining time display function.<br><br>It is equipped with a function to select 15 songs in front and back.<br><br>It has a headphone port.<br><br>Equipped with timer recording and replay function.<br><br>Equipped with an auto tape selector.<br><br>Equipped with CD-Deck synchro function and REC mute with auto space.<br><br>Equipped with a last memory function, it records FLAT System data, main switch positions, etc.<br>This allows advanced recording even during timer recording.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
