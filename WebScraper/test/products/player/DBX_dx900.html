				<p class="detail">CD player with improved sound quality by thorough anti-resonance design.<br><br>The pickup section moves on two slider shafts for tracing. The DX900 uses a new material, zirconia ceramic for this slider shaft.<br>This material has hardness and abrasion resistance close to that of diamond, and extremely excellent smoothness. It is less susceptible to vibration, and the tracing accuracy is further improved. Moreover, the initial characteristics are maintained for 10 times longer than that of conventional stainless steel materials, and the reliability of the tracking mechanism is improved.<br><br>The mechanical deck, which is the base of the optical system and drive system, has a hybrid structure in which two kinds of materials with different resonance frequencies are integrated by outsert molding. As a result, high strength and processing accuracy are obtained, and at the same time, resonance sharpness is greatly reduced compared with single materials such as aluminum die-cast, and vibration control is greatly improved, and generation and transmission of unnecessary vibration are effectively reduced.<br>In addition, a three point support system has been adopted for the support system of the entire mechanical deck. Two points on the panel side are supported by a three way flexible damper, and one point on the rear side is designed to be unloaded, thereby eliminating the effects of external vibrations and shocks.<br><br>Extremely rigid black ceramic is used for the legs, and fine ceramic spacers are placed at four locations where the circuit board is attached to the chassis to prevent vibration transmission to the component parts.<br><br>The digital filter uses a 16-bit 4-times oversampling digital filter.<br>This eliminates the frequency lower limit of unwanted components from 24.1 kHz to 156.4 kHz and makes the low-pass filter after D/A conversion into a third order Bessel filter with extremely gentle cut-off characteristics, contributing to the simplification of analog circuits and improved sound quality.<br><br>The D/A converter uses a 16-bit linear D/A converter, and the left and right channels are used independently to eliminate the phase shift between the channels.<br>This D/A converter does not generate glitch, which is a kind of digital noise. It has a very simple structure that eliminates the need for a glitter circuit, which was indispensable in the past, and the analog circuit is only a third order Bessel filter.<br><br>High-quality parts such as ceramic containing powder electrolytic capacitor, copper foil Styrofoam capacitor, LC-OFC wire rod, etc., which are examined with priority on sound quality are used.<br><br>An optical transmission method using a photocoupler has been introduced for digital data transmission of emphasis and output mute to the analog system, and the circuits are electrically isolated from each other.<br>The power supply circuit uses a separate system that completely separates digital circuits from analog circuits.<br>It effectively prevents degradation of sound quality in analog circuits due to interference from the digital system and mixing of digital noise.<br><br>Equipped with a digital output terminal.<br><br>Self-calendaring 20 keys are used.<br>The 20 keys for direct selection and the calendar function are docked, and the track number of songs recorded on the disc or program is directly displayed with the corresponding keys lit. The keys of songs that have finished playing are turned off so that you can check the progress of the music at a glance.<br>In addition, it is equipped with the Up 10 key, and you can quickly select songs of Track No. 21 or higher.<br><br>The display section has a multi-mode double display.<br>It is designed with two separate displays that operate continuously. The upper large display shows the track number and number of songs as well as the operating status and the next operation procedure in alphabet. The lower display shows time information such as elapsed time, total playing time, and remaining time for each song. It also shows the index number and order of program songs.<br><br>It has a program memory function of up to 24 songs.<br>The program contents can be checked by the memory call function.<br><br>Equipped with a random BGM play function.<br><br>One track / all tracks / section, program track and peat function is equipped.<br><br>It is equipped with skip search and index search.<br><br>Equipped with a headphone port with volume.<br><br>Wireless remote control with 20 keys is included.</p>
