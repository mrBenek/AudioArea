				<p class="detail">A DVD audio / video player with progressive output.<br>It conforms to the THX Ultra standard, a quality standard advocated by Lucasfilm.<br><br>It is compatible with the progressive system, which has approximately twice the amount of information compared to the interlaced system used for terrestrial TV broadcasting.<br>For the DVD-A1, a new converter was jointly developed with Silicon Image, Inc. and is equipped with the &quot;New Pure Progressive Circuit&quot; which realizes more accurate and faster progressive conversion than the conventional one.<br>This provides fast detection of 3-2 pull-down in film mode and reduces noise.<br>In addition, four fields of images are stored in memory, and moving image information is detected and image correction is performed to compensate for image motion between fields. In contrast to the normal progressive method, which detects video signals in units of one field, the New Pure Progressive Method enables correction processing in units of one pixel, enabling more accurate discrimination of moving images and still images.<br>In addition, it prevents flicker due to detection delay even for mixed film and video mode sources, and enables high-quality progressive playback of any disc.<br><br>A 14bit/108MHz video DAC is used.<br>Two video DACs, one for progressive signal processing and the other for interlaced signal processing, are used to eliminate interference between progressive and interlaced video signals.<br>For more precise D/A conversion, the sampling rate is increased to 4 x oversampling for progressive video signals and to 8 x oversampling for interlaced video signals.<br><br>A super sub-alias filter is used to cut off unwanted band signal components above the signal band of the video signal after D/A conversion.<br>This filter has flat characteristics in the necessary band so that it does not adversely affect the video signal, and has sufficient cut-off characteristics in the unnecessary band to eliminate aliasing noise.<br>The video S/N ratio is improved because a super subalias filter is provided for chroma as well as luminance signal.<br><br>Noise Shaved Video (NSV) technology drives video noise into unwanted bands while an analog filter effectively removes noise to improve the S/N ratio of the video signal.<br><br>Equipped with AL24 Processing Plus, an analog waveform reproduction technology that supports DVD Audio sampling frequency of 192 kHz.<br>Using the input digital data as a clue, this system interpolates the digital data so that the sound becomes closer to the analog waveform that should have existed in the natural world. By reproducing 16-bit data such as CDs with 24-bit quality, this system increases the ability to reproduce music at low volumes such as reverberation.<br>In addition, it inherits the Adaptive Digital Filter (Adaptive Line Pattern Harmonized Algorithm &amp; Automatic Low Pass Filter Harmonic Adjustment) that automatically adjusts the cutoff band, which was a conventional feature, and suppresses the occurrence of folding distortion such as linking when a pulsed signal is reproduced.<br><br>All channels of the D/A converter are equipped with a multi-24-bit D/A converter, and the front 2 ch is equipped with a 4 dac configuration.<br>The multi-24-bit D / A converter is less susceptible to noise caused by fluctuations in the power supply voltage (current). Moreover, since the in-band quantization distortion level is constant regardless of frequency, clear playback that is less susceptible to noise is possible.<br><br>Equipped with Dolby digital and DTS decoder.<br><br>Equipped with an HDCD decoder.<br><br>Equipped with S. V. H (Suppress Vibration Hybrid) loader.<br>The tray uses highly vibration-resistant paint and a large plate at the rear of the tray to prevent delicate deformation, ensuring stable rotation and absorbing vibration.<br><br>In order to prevent adverse effects of external vibration, a vibration isolation design is provided.<br>The base plate of the chassis is a 4-layer hybrid 6 mm thick structure consisting of 1.2 mm thick copper plated steel plate and 3 sheets of 1.6m steel plate.<br>In addition, sintered alloy insulators are used to absorb vibrations from the outside.<br>In addition, the base plate, side and front reinforcing plates, and four 1.2 mm thick copper-plated steel plates are used, and the chassis is composed of three boxes, so that the power supply, video, digital circuit, and audio circuit are structurally separated and the strength is increased.<br>In addition, copper plating brings the ground potential of the entire chassis closer to the same potential, which increases the effect of suppressing electrical noise.<br>In addition, three types of 1.2 mm thick plates with different shapes are used for the top cover, and 2.5 mm thick die-cast aluminum panels are used for the side.<br><br>A cast-aluminum mechanical base is used between the DVD mechanical unit and the transformer and the chassis.<br>By using parts made of different materials, it is possible to absorb the vibration of itself and also to absorb external vibration to ensure stable operation.<br><br>Separate power supplies are used for signal processing blocks and video blocks to eliminate interference with other blocks.<br><br>Audio circuit boards, video circuit boards, digital circuit boards, and power circuit boards are independently laid out for each block to eliminate interference with other circuits.<br><br>A copper bypass plate is used for the ground pattern of the audio circuit and power supply circuit to reduce the impedance of the ground.<br><br>High-quality parts such as electrolytic capacitors for audio are used in the audio block and power supply block for audio.<br><br>Equipped with DENON LINK, balance output by high-speed transfer element is possible between compatible DENON AV amplifiers.<br>(The gold model released after November 2002 and the limited production black model were equipped with DENON LINK S. E. capable of transmitting all high-quality digital signals with full specs, from 192kHz/24bit high-quality 2-channel digital signals of DVD-Audio to multi-channel signals of PCM.)<br><br>Equipped with a digital input terminal, the AL24 Processing Plus can be used with external digital devices.<br><br>Pure Direct Mode is installed to achieve pure audio playback.<br>In this mode, you can turn off the digital signal output, video signal output, and display, which tend to interfere with analog audio signals, and output only audio signals.<br>Two modes can be set, and the stored mode can be switched with the pure direct switch on the body panel.<br><br>You can adjust Contrast, Brightness, Hue, Sharpness, and Gamma to your desired image quality.<br><br>For accurate multi-channel playback, you can set the speaker configuration and delay time to suit the conditions of the room in which playback is performed while watching the monitor screen.<br><br>It supports MP3 digital audio compression and CD-R/RW playback, making it possible to play MP3 files recorded on a PC.<br><br>JPEG images recorded on CD-R/RW can be played back.<br><br>Both NTSC and PAL signals are supported.<br><br>It is possible to play Kodak Picture CD.<br><br>Comes with a self-illuminated remote control.<br><br>There was also a black model with limited production.</p>
