				<p class="detail">A CD player developed with the aim of Akai&#39;s ideal CD player.<br><br>Anti-resonance construction has been developed and installed with an emphasis on vibration control of the player itself.<br>First of all, the cabinet top cover is made of a composite damping steel sheet with antiresonance new metal sandwiched between metal steel plates made of a unique polymer material. Compared with ordinary steel plates, this steel plate is less susceptible to vibration and has extremely short damping characteristics.<br>The insulator uses a new material, anti-resonance special rubber with excellent vibration damping characteristics to absorb external vibrations.<br>In addition, it employs a double-insulated floating mechanism that combines rubber and spring and mechanically insulates the entire mechanical block, including the optical system and drive system, from the main body. Comparatively high-frequency vibrations are absorbed by spring, and low-frequency vibration components are absorbed by special rubber.<br><br>The power supply section has been strengthened, and the digital and analog systems, including the servo circuit, have been made independent of the power transformer winding, and the rectifier circuit has been adopted as a separate power supply. In addition, the amplifier and D/A converter of the analog rectifier circuit have been made independent of each other. This eliminates the power supply from the digital circuit and the contamination of harmful components such as noise.<br>In addition, since the power supply space is related to the sense of volume in the low frequency range, two specially designed 2,200 μ F electrolytic capacitors are used for both digital and analog current supply circuits. These capacitors damp squeals and use paints that do not contain metal components to achieve non-magnetic properties.<br><br>The servo circuit is equipped with a new servo control system that normally applies relatively light servo control to prevent reading errors due to scratches or dust, and that only strengthens servo control when trace errors are likely to occur due to unexpected external vibration.<br>As a result, traceability is greatly improved and large fluctuations in servo amount are suppressed.<br><br>A digital filter with an attenuation of 90 dB has been developed and installed. Sharp attenuation characteristics and almost flat group delay characteristics in the audio band are obtained.<br>After the digital filter is inserted a 7th order low-distortion low-pass filter with a gentle curve to remove residual components. This filter uses a coil (high-core type) with low squeal and a copper foil styrofoam capacitor with excellent hearing test results to prevent sound quality degradation.<br>In addition, parts such as copper foil Styrofoam capacitors, metal-coated resistors, and high-speed Bi-FET operational amplifiers are used in critical parts of de-emphasis circuits and analog circuits.<br><br>It is equipped with It&#39;s Logic function which is AKAI&#39;s original programming mechanism.<br>This is a unique program that combines the 10 key with the three keys And, To, and Without. For example, if you want to play the first to sixth songs except the fourth song on the disc, press the key 1To6 Without 4.<br>This program can be programmed up to 27 steps with one key operation as one step.<br><br>It is equipped with functions such as music search, index search, 2-way speed manual search, section (A ⇔ B) repeat, program skip play, etc.<br><br>Subcode terminal is mounted.<br><br>Equipped with a headphone port with volume.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
