				<p class="detail">This MD deck is equipped with various functions based on digital processing which inherited the design concept of MDS-JA3ES.<br><br>Based on this digital processing technology, a newly developed 18-bit Σ Δ (sigma-delta) A/D converter using an over-sampling method is installed in the A/D conversion section to improve the precision of micro-level signal processing.<br>The D/A converter is equipped with a hybrid pulse D/A converter with a built-in noise-shaping digital filter for high-precision oversampling operation.<br><br>It is equipped with a sampling rate converter that automatically converts each sampling frequency such as 48 kHz or 32 kHz to 44.1 kHz.<br>It also has an LED display function that shows the sampling frequency of the digitally input source.<br><br>It is equipped with a time machine recording function, and if you press the multi-jog dial in the recording pause state, the sound recorded up to 6 seconds before is recorded on the disc.<br><br>You can automatically find the unrecorded portion and record it, record from the beginning of the song you want to delete, or record from the middle of any song.<br>It is also equipped with a Smart Space recording function that automatically adjusts the interval between songs to approximately 3 seconds during digital recording.<br><br>It is equipped with a title function that allows you to enter a title of up to approximately 1,700 characters per disc in the title and disc name and display it on the FL display. In addition to alphanumeric characters and symbols, the MDS-503 also allows you to enter katakana characters.<br>In addition to the input by the multi-jog remote control and remote control, the input by the Katakana input dedicated remote commander (sold separately) is also supported.<br>In addition, it is equipped with a date function that can record the date and time when each song is recorded.<br><br>Equipped with the TOC EDIT function, you can perform four operations : COMBINE to combine two consecutive songs into one song, DIVIDE to divide one song into two, MOVE to change the order of the songs, and ERASE to erase a song. In addition, the UNDO function is newly installed to allow you to redo the last operation.<br>In addition, DIVIDE and COMBINE have a rehearsal function that allows you to check edit points. With DIVIDE, you can fine-tune edit points in a range of up to -128 to + 127 steps (one step is approximately 0.06 seconds).<br><br>Equipped with two digital input terminals that are coaxial with the optical system.<br>Also, an optical digital output terminal is mounted.<br><br>Equipped with a disk-in auto power function that turns the power on just by inserting a disk.<br><br>It comes with a Sony CD player and a wireless remote controller that can record CD synchronously.<br><br>Mono format discs are play-only.<br><br>It is equipped with a 4-megabit DRAM that can store music signals for up to about 8 seconds to prevent skipping sound.<br>In addition, taking advantage of memory storage, Memory Start playback, in which the sound starts immediately after the pause is released, is made possible.<br><br>Serial Copy Management System (SCMS) allows only one generation of digital recording and no more than two generations of digital recording.</p>
