				<p class="detail">This DAT deck is equipped with a rollback REC function that realizes reduction of joint recording noise in addition to analog input 44.1 kHz recording of CD function.<br><br>It is equipped with a Rollback REC function that can be used to frequently repeat recording and recording pose operations.<br>After recording the track format for a few more seconds from the moment of the recording pause, the tape is sent while recording only the track format. Then, the tape is rewound to the timing immediately before the recording pause, and it becomes standby.<br><br>The I/O terminal is equipped with a standard jack as well as a pin jack for connection to an audio mixer.<br><br>A 4D. D. motor mechanism with independent direct drive motors for the capstan that controls tape movement, for both supply and take-up reels that fast-forward and rewind tapes, and for the head drum rotation that reads signals.<br>By installing a dedicated motor for each role without belt transmission, the load on the motor is reduced and the accuracy and stability of tape running are improved.<br><br>The A/D converter is equipped with a pulse A/D converter with a built-in 1-bit modulator, and achieves a theoretical S / N ratio of 119 dB by performing high-speed, high-precision operations with 64 x oversampling and 5th order noise shaping.<br>In addition, by separating it from the decimation filter that performs the digital operation to return the sampling rate and making it independent, the influence of noise on the modulator that handles analog signals can be reduced.<br><br>Equipped with SBM (Super Bit Mapping) digital filter.<br>SBM achieves significant noise reduction by shifting quantization noise that is uniformly distributed within the audible band to higher frequencies that are difficult to hear due to human audibility characteristics, and by recoding low-order 4-bit information that is normally truncated to high-order 16-bit information using the principle of noise shaping.<br>The SBM digital filter uses the built-in decimation filter to reduce aliasing noise and uses the SBM to convert the 24-bit data output from the decimation filter into 16-bit data almost as it is, enabling high-quality recording.<br><br>The D/A converter employs an advanced pulse D/A converter that uses Sony&#39;s proprietary high-precision calculation method to achieve higher pulse output density.<br>By using single-chip ICs with single-channel 4D/A outputs and double-channel 8D/A outputs, and performing complimentary service PLM operation (differential-synthesis of two pulse wave outputs that are complementary to each other), the generation of harmonic distortion is reduced.<br><br>It is equipped with a subcode function, and recording and erasing of start ID, skip ID and end ID are possible.<br>The Start ID is a subcode that indicates the beginning of a song. It is equipped with two modes : Auto, which is automatically written at the start of a song, and Manual, which can be written at any position you like (excluding immediately after the Start ID, 9 seconds in SP mode, and 18 seconds in LP mode).<br>The Skip ID is an ID that is written at the beginning of the part you want to listen to when you play the tape. When you find the Skip ID during playback, it fast-forwards to the next Start ID.<br>Also, if the end ID is written at the end of the required part, it is regarded as the end of the tape, and auto-rewind is performed during playback, and stop during fast-forward.<br><br>It is equipped with a rehearse function for writing the start ID and the skip ID / end ID manually during playback.<br>During the rehearsal, you can move the point back and forth in 0.3 second increments while listening to and confirming the sound. The movement time is displayed on the display and can be set while confirming.<br>In addition, the start ID that has already been written can be corrected while rehearsing.<br><br>You can assign a program number to the Start ID, and you can directly select a song by simply specifying the number when playing it. The program number is automatically assigned when recording and can be changed by renumbering.<br><br>To correct program numbers that have become uneven by adding or deleting the start ID, it is possible to renumber the numbers from the beginning of the tape with one touch.<br><br>It is equipped with a shift number function that renumbers while reattaching the start ID in 0.3 second increments.<br><br>Equipped with end search function, end ID or unrecorded part can be searched automatically.<br><br>It is compatible with SCMS (serial copy management system) and allows digital to digital recording for only one generation using CD software as master. When only analog input / output terminal is used, repeated recording is possible without restriction of SCMS.<br><br>In addition to the conventional 48 kHz mode (standard) and 32 kHz ・ LP mode, the analog input mode is equipped with a new 44.1 kHz mode, making it possible to record in the same way as the CD format.<br><br>The digital peak margin display shows how much more room is left in the recording level in dB. The level can be adjusted to take advantage of the wide dynamic range.<br><br>Equipped with a CD Q-code decoding function, when recording a CD with digital input, it is possible to decode the Q-code, which is information between songs on the digital interface, and automatically write an accurate start ID.<br><br>The fs map function using the digital peak level meter provides a visual indication of which sampling frequency is recorded at an approximate location on the tape.<br><br>Sold separately, there was a foot switch that you can control recording and playback with your foot.</p>
