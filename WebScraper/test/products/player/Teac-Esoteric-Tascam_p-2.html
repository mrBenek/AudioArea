				<p class="detail">CD drive unit equipped with unique V. R. D. S. mechanism.<br><br>The mechanism part is equipped with TEAC&#39;s original V. R. D. S. (Vibration-Free Rigid Disc-Clamping System).<br>In the V. R. D. S. mechanism, a highly precisely adjusted clamper is attached to a turntable having the same diameter as the disc and a delicate angle. This method corrects warping and distortion of the disc and completely eliminates unnecessary vibration of the disc. In addition, the pickup, which is finely adjusted to the same angle as the large-diameter turntable, always succeeds in reading a minute pit at the center of the optical axis of the pickup.<br>The P-2 has newly adopted a zinc die-cast turntable, and the resonance frequency and vibration mode have been greatly reduced by crimping the disk with a clamper via a high-precision helicoid.<br>In order to move this turntable smoothly, a high magnetic flux density samarium-cobalt magnet is used in the brushless Hall motor to obtain high torque and form a stable rotating drive part.<br>In addition, zinc die-cast is used for the mechanical base and motor bearing bridge that support the whole mechanism, and in addition to durability and rotational stability, high reliability is obtained.<br><br>The chassis has a double-chassis structure.<br>In order to increase the rigidity of the P-2, the raised part of the inner chassis is further expanded, and it is firmly joined to the aluminum machined front panel with the thickest part of 18 mm. As a result, the case is less affected by sound pressure from speakers, etc., and is more resistant to external vibration and internal resonance.<br><br>A special alloy heavy-weight insulator is used for the insulator.<br><br>The newly developed CN servo is used in the servo circuit to prevent the disturbance of the current due to the increase of the servo amount from forming noise components and affecting the analog system.<br>The CN servo uses an LC filter module to rapidly filter the band that causes unnecessary vibration. By attenuating the servo current by approximately 60 dB, the vibration of the optical system mechanism is eliminated and quietness is greatly improved.<br><br>By making the opening of the disk tray as narrow as possible and keeping switches to the minimum necessary, the total body strength is improved.<br>In addition, the disk is protected by the Nextel specification of the slim and highly rigid thin aluminum machined disk tray.<br><br>You can adjust the brightness of the display continuously with the volume of the side panel.<br>The display can also be turned on / off by remote control operation.<br><br>Equipped with a D. V. S. C. (Disc-Tray Variable Speed Control) mechanism that can adjust the IN/OUT speed of the disk tray. The tray speed can be adjusted separately for IN/OUT by a high-precision pulse detection servo motor.<br>In the P-2, the diameter of the shaft that supports the tray is made extremely large, and high-precision bearings are used for the rail part to improve quietness.<br><br>PC-OCC is used for all transmission wire materials.<br>The circuit board is a double-sided through-hole, gold-plated glass epoxy board that is highly durable and resistant to aging.<br><br>Pin cord made by Van den Hull is included.<br><br>Equipped with output terminals for two optical systems and two coaxial systems.<br><br>A newly developed high-capacity audio transformer is used for the power supply.<br><br>It comes with a wireless remote controller that can control P-2 and D-2 functions.</p>
