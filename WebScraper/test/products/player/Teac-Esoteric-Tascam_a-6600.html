				<p class="detail">An open reel deck developed as the top of a four track deck.<br><br>Equipped with a Oatley berth regeneration mechanism.<br>If you apply a sensing foil to the area where you want the tape to be reversed, the tape will be automatically reversed from forward to reverse. In reverse, a delay circuit operates and the tape will run after the capstan motor reaches a constant speed.<br><br>A twin capstan system is adopted for the mechanism part.<br>By separating the capstan dedicated to forward and the capstan dedicated to reverse into left and right, the same conditions are obtained even in reverse as in forward, and uniform tape travel is achieved in both directions.<br>In addition, the two capstans are always rotating in opposite directions so that the reel can be turned over smoothly, resulting in a quick rise.<br><br>Equipped with counter repeat playback mechanism, it can be repeated many times by combining with Oatley verse.<br>If you set the counter to 0000 at the point you want to repeat, it automatically returns from reverse to forward.<br><br>Equipped with a tension guide roller.<br>The tape guide part of the tension arm is designed to rotate smoothly, and the tape runs more smoothly than the fixed type.<br><br>Equipped with 1/3, 4/2 track selection queue mechanism.<br>In the past, queuing of tracks 1 and 3 was possible, but queuing of tracks 4 and 2 (reverse track) was not possible without using a tape. With the A-6600, queuing of a reverse track is possible without using a tape.<br><br>Equipped with auto spacer.<br>If you press the Pause button while recording with Auto Spacer ON, the FOMA terminal automatically creates a no-signal portion at a fixed interval and waits for the next recording to resume.<br>The non-signal portion can be set arbitrarily between approximately 3 to 8 seconds.<br><br>Equipped with a recording mode standby lamp.<br>When the recording mode switch is turned ON, the red REC lamp flashes. When recording starts, the lamp lights up to indicate that recording is being performed.<br><br>Equipped with an independent left and right channel recording volume fine-tuning mechanism, you can adjust the balance of recording levels.<br>In addition, both the microphone and line are equipped with a master volume that combines the left and right channels into one, making it easy to perform operations such as fade-in and fade-out.<br><br>The master volume can be used for both left and right playback at the same time. Also for playback, there is an independent fine-tuning volume for both left and right playback, which can be adjusted when there is an error in the recording level.<br>The regeneration reference level for the master volume is the point marked 0 VU.<br><br>The tape monitor switch has a CAL position in addition to the conventional Source and Tape positions.<br>When the CAL button is pressed, regardless of the position of the output volume, the meter is calibrated to 0 VU = JIS reference level (reference level of the test tape). This can be used to determine the recording level of the tape or to use amplifiers or headphones with widely different input sensitivities.<br>In the Out position, the meter indication is linked to the output volume.<br><br>Equipped with LED peak level indicator.<br>The LED lights up at + 10 VU at 19cm/s and at + 8 VU at 9.5cm/s. The memory circuit also lights up for 70 ms at short pulse signals.<br><br>Equipped with an independent switching mechanism for bias and equalizer.<br><br>Equipped with a microphone attenuator.<br><br>The head part is equipped with a high hardness permalloy head.<br><br>A timer recording and re-mechanism can be added by installing a timer control adapter sold separately.<br>Equipped with a separately sold remote control unit, it can be operated from a remote location.</p>
