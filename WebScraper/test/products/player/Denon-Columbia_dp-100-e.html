				<p class="detail">An armless record player developed by integrating all of DENON&#39;s player technology.<br><br>The drive motor employs a 10 kg out Rocester 3-phase AC servo motor with a torque of 10kg-cm that is used for cutting machines as well as for broadcasting station players. This powerful motor has a weight of 6.5 kg and a moment of inertia of 1,260kg-cm.<sup>2</sup>To 33 1/3 revolutions in only 0.4 seconds from the start.<br>A high S / N ratio has been achieved by the adoption of an AC3-phase drive system that eliminates the third harmonic of the rotating magnetic field, which causes vibration and reversing torque, and by the adoption of a winding system that ensures uniform magnetic flux between the rotor and stator, even if there is a gap between the rotor and stator, and by the consistent vibration resistant structure including the frame.<br>The shaft is made of special stainless steel with a diameter of 14 mm. After heat treatment and high-precision polishing, it is wrapped.<br>A special alloy is used for the radial bearing, and smooth rotation is obtained by lapping, and high durability is obtained by using a mirror-finished sapphire bearing for the thrust bearing that supports the entire rotating system.<br>It is equipped with a safety mechanism to prevent troubles caused by unexpected external forces. It operates when a load of approximately 50 kg or more is applied to the turntable to prevent damage to sapphire bearings, etc.<br><br>For the turntable, we have further developed the double-structured turntable used in the DP-80 and so on.<br>Structurally, the upper and lower turntables are connected by a spring and a fluid damper, and the lower part is fixed to the motor rotor, so that the upper part where records are placed is vibrationally isolated from the motor and frame, and a high-cut filter is formed by the mass of the upper turntables and the compliance of the spring.<br>In addition, the adverse effect of acoustic feedback caused by sound pressure transmitted directly from the speaker to the record and upper turntable is solved by the difference in vibration mode due to the difference in mass between the two turntables, the fluid damper between the two turntables, and the turntable seat with high vibration absorption effect.<br>These measures eliminate harmful vibrations and eliminate sound coloring, as well as problems such as poor crosstalk caused by affecting the opposite channel in the heavy low-frequency portion of a record, resulting in an unclear sound image.<br>The upper and lower turntables are integrated in the direction of rotation.<br><br>The servo mechanism uses a double PLL servo system combining DENON quartz and PLL synthesizer IC.<br>DENON quartz has developed and adopted DENON&#39;s original magnetic recording detection method that applies 1000 pulse signals. Two pulse detection heads are attached at two opposing positions. This has the effect of mutually canceling the very slight eccentricity of the magnetic pulse recording surface, making it possible to pick up a highly accurate detection signal. By comparing the phases of the obtained signal with the phases of the signal generated by the reference oscillator (crystal), a powerful two way servomechanism that can control the rotational speed more severely is realized. In addition, it is an advanced method that detects the speed at the periphery of the turntable where the wow flutter phenomenon can be detected most prominently.<br>In the double PLL servo system, the oscillation frequency is accurately changed while maintaining the accuracy of the quartz oscillator. This frequency is used as the reference frequency for the phase comparator circuit of the motor servo system, and the pitch can be controlled in a quartz-locked state.<br>The pitch control circuit can be combined with a digital display to set an accurate pitch from high9.9% to low9.9% with an accuracy of 0.1% pitch (half tone = 5.9%) at each specified rotation speed.<br>This powerful servomechanism has achieved load resistance of 1.5 kg in terms of needle pressure.<br><br>The frame is made of thick cast aluminum with a total weight of 13 kg and is less susceptible to the effects of floors and sound pressure.<br>In addition, a servo circuit, various control circuits, transformers, etc. are mounted floating, and at the same time, vibration and noise are taken into consideration.<br><br>A solid insulator composed of a spring and a fluid damper is used for the insulator.<br>The low-frequency cutoff frequency is set to 3.5 kg, and vibration transmitted from the floor to the frame body is prevented. Natural vibration caused by the insulator and frame noise are also prevented by the fluid damper.<br><br>The arm board adopts an arm board exchange system that enables the mounting of internal and external long type tone arms. The arm board is made of aluminum casting, and by floating the board itself, a strong anti-vibration structure is realized.<br>The floating arm board is structurally similar to a turntable. Vibration from the frame is eliminated by a spring and a fluid damper, and disturbance energy due to acoustic feedback and vibration of the arm board are absorbed and attenuated.<br>The replacement armboard was sold separately and made to order.</p>
