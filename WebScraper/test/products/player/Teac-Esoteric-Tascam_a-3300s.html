				<p class="detail">As a sister machine of the A-2300S, this tape deck is compatible with No. 10 reel and has improved durability.<br><br>The head uses a hyperbolic type that enables sound recording and playback with less distortion up to the high-frequency range, preventing the low-frequency range from being disturbed by the contour effect (shape effect).<br>The head has a front shield to prevent crosstalk from adjacent tracks and the influence of leakage flux of the transformer motor, and the separation is improved.<br><br>Ferrite core is used for the erasing head and litz wire is used for the winding.<br>In addition, the push-pull type oscillation circuit with a margin provides stable operation even for low-noise tapes with deep bias. The bias frequency is 100 kHz, which is efficient, to prevent beat.<br><br>The 3-head system, with separate recording and playback heads, allows simultaneous monitoring of playback sound from tape. The level meter also works with the monitor switch to indicate the input level and playback level.<br><br>The equalizer stage of the pre-amplifier uses a 3-stage direct connection circuit that combines NPN-PNP-NPN transistors.<br>This circuit method is also applied to the line amplifier (2-stage) to obtain a stable dynamic range from high to low frequencies. In addition, the line amplifier has an excellent linearity of more than 25 dB from the nominal output of the tape by selecting the operating point of the transistor optimally and setting the level diagram carefully.<br><br>All operation mechanisms use micro switches to improve operability.<br>In addition, quick cutting is possible with the pose mechanism of quick operation.<br><br>It is possible to follow up recording. During playback, press the Play button again while pressing the Rec button to start recording.<br><br>Equipped with timer recording / playback mechanism, timer recording and playback is possible by combining timer control adapter sold separately with timer.<br>During standby, the pinch roller and all other mechanisms are free from stress.<br><br>The microphone input and line input volumes are independent, making it possible to record mixed sound.<br><br>The bias and equalizer can be switched independently, making it possible to bring out the performance of the tape.<br><br>It uses an expanded scale level meter that is independent on the left and right.<br><br>It uses a quick lock reel clamper and can be set just by turning the shaft to the right.<br>In addition, adjustment is possible with the reel compensation sheet.<br><br>The capstan motor is a 4-pole, 8-pole, 2-speed hysteresis synchronous motor. The capstan shaft with a diameter of 6 mm and roundness error of 0.15 μ and the flywheel with dynamic balance realizes stable tape travel.<br>In addition, the reel motor uses a 6-pole in-rotor type with less hunting and strong starting torque. It provides stable back tension and stabilizes the head touch and speed deviation of the tape.<br>The 3 motors are electrically linked using micro switches, relays, and solenoids.<br><br>The panel chassis is a combination of stainless steel and aluminum, and the side is a die-cast reinforced frame.<br><br>To protect the tape, the brake mechanism consists of aluminum die-cast and special felt. It works with a 6-pole reel motor that is fed at a constant speed to provide balanced braking.<br><br>It uses an oil dump type tension arm unique to TEAC.<br><br>Manual queuing is possible, and when the pinch roller is lifted by hand during quick winding, the tape lifter retracts and the tape touches the head so that the head can be pushed out.<br><br>Equipped with a reel selector switch, it can simultaneously switch between tick-up tension and back tension depending on the reel size.<br><br>Equipped with a headphone port linked to the playback volume.<br><br>When the tape is wound, the mechanism automatically stops in conjunction with the shut-off lever.<br><br>Equipped with a 4-digit index counter.<br><br>There was a remote controller sold separately.</p>
