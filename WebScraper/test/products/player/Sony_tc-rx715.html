				<p class="detail">A quick reverse deck equipped with Auto Wreck Condition Optimizer.<br><br>It uses a midship mechanical system with a heavy mechanical deck located in the center of the front panel, which reduces the negative impact of chassis distortion on sound.<br><br>High-rigidity, high-density fine ceramic composite material is used for the cassette holder to reduce unnecessary vibration due to the high rigidity of ceramic. In addition, aluminum extruding material is used for the cassette lid to improve accuracy.<br><br>It is equipped with cassette stabilizers. As soon as the tape is loaded, the stabilizers installed inside the cassette door fix the cassette half and osae komi the vibration of the tape.<br><br>Laser-molded amorphous magnetic alloys with excellent magnetic properties are used for the head, and high-purity oxygen-free copper PC-OCC is used for the head winding, enabling recording and playback with less signal loss.<br><br>Equipped with the Dolby HX-PRO, the bias current, which is normally fixed, is controlled to an optimum value in units of one thousandth of a second according to the frequency and level of the signal, thereby maintaining linearity in the high frequency range.<br><br>By using a super-bias and shifting up the bias signal frequency, the difference with the audio signal frequency is expanded, which prevents beat noise and intermodulation distortion due to interference between signals.<br><br>Equipped with an auto-calibration function that automatically sets the recording condition to match the tape to be used.<br><br>Equipped with a sound auto-focus function that uses a microcomputer to control the recording level setting to detect the tape position and presence of Dolby NR and to automatically adjust the recording level volume according to the input signal level.<br><br>Equipped with Auto-Rec Condition Optimizer, it is one button linked with auto-calibration to adjust bias / level, sound auto-focus to adjust recording level, just-fade-out to narrow recording level with tape end, and operation from sending the tape to the recordable part to recording standby.<br><br>Equipped with a CD sync recording function, you can easily record from a CD by pairing it with a Sony remote-controlled CD player.<br>If you press the CD sync button on the remote control provided with the deck, the deck will start recording from the pause state and the CD will start playing a little later.<br><br>It is equipped with an electronic counter that adopts FL tube.<br>It uses a linear system that displays minutes and seconds linked to the time the tape actually ran. It also has a subtraction function that allows you to check the remaining time of the tape.<br><br>It is equipped with a peak level meter that can display the peak value of the audio signal in real time and also has a peak hold function.<br><br>You can switch the display mode between two modes : all ON / OFF.<br><br>Equipped with a Just Fade Out function that automatically narrows down the recording level at the tape end during recording and automatically returns to the original recording level after reverse.<br><br>Equipped with an auto-fader function, you can fade out / fade in by pressing the buttons while recording, and you can also fade in the recorded messages linked to the timer.<br><br>It is equipped with multi-AMS function which is further advanced from AMS function.<br>With this function, you can start up to 30 songs before and after the current tape position.<br><br>Records to tape and waits in the recording pause state.<br><br>It is equipped with a power loading function. When the operation button such as play / fast forward / rewind is pressed without closing the cassette door, the tape is loaded automatically.<br><br>Equipped with L/Rch independent stereo microphone input terminal.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
