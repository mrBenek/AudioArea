				<p class="detail">A stereo cassette deck with FRTS and other functions in pursuit of the limits of cassettes.<br><br>Equipped with a tape selector that can independently select three bias levels, three recording equalizers, and two playback equalizers.<br><br>Equipped with FRTS (Flat Response Tuning System) capable of fine-tuning bias while directly observing frequency characteristics.<br>In FRTS, a test signal from the built-in hybrid oscillator is recorded and monitored simultaneously by the test head, and the output levels of 400 Hz and 8 kHz are displayed on the left and right meters respectively. By rotating the bias adjustment knob so that the deflection of the left and right hands become equal, a flat point of frequency characteristics can be obtained.<br>To adjust the FRTS, first set the selector to the TEST position, then set the tape selector to the tape type, insert the tape into the recording mode, and adjust the azimuth of the test head. Turn the bias adjustment knob to find the optimum bias value at which the frequency response becomes flat.<br><br>Equipped with a double-needle meter that can read two levels simultaneously : the general sound level perceived by the human ear and the peak level contained in the actual music signal. In particular, the peak meter was newly developed for use on cassette decks. By using a 4-stage operational amplifier, sufficient performance such as response characteristics, recovery time and indication range has been obtained.<br>The peak level meter has a response characteristic of 10 msec, a recovery time of 1.5 seconds, and an indication range of -40dB to + 10 dB.<br><br>It is equipped with a peak hold mechanism. When the peak hold button is turned ON, the peak level indication of the input signal can be held for a certain period of time. When a larger signal is input, the maximum value is indicated and held, making it easy to check the peak level of the program source.<br>The peak hold time is 30 minutes (-1dB).<br><br>The motor employs a 38-pulse FG servo motor with a fast response speed. In addition, the accuracy of tape transport parts such as the flywheel, capstan, and reel shaft has been thoroughly pursued to achieve excellent performance.<br><br>A cassette auto-loading mechanism is used. When the tape is lightly pressed or the cassette lid is closed, the cassette is automatically carried by the carrier. This mechanism protects the mechanism of the tape drive part because fingers do not directly touch the mechanism.<br><br>Equipped with a limiter climate to prevent recording errors when inputting too much data.<br><br>It has a built-in timer standby mechanism. If you connect the timer and set the deck to the recording standby state, recording will start automatically at the desired time. Also, if you use it for regenerating condition, you can play the alarm clock.<br><br>Uses a non-contact type full auto-stop mechanism using a Hall IC that combines a Hall element and IC.<br>As a result, tape running is not adversely affected and unpleasant noise is suppressed.<br><br>The Dolby System is installed as a noise reduction system.<br>Since the Dolby switch and the MPX filter switch are linked, setting the MPX filter OFF when recording Dolby on the FM stereo broadcast transmission will improve the frequency response.<br><br>It is equipped with a player sync terminal. By connecting to a record player with a Rec Sync terminal of Aiwa, when recording a record, the pause button on the deck is released as soon as the player starts.<br><br>Built-in memory counter and quick review queue function.<br><br>There was a side wood sold separately.</p>
