				<p class="detail">This cassette deck was developed using Aiwa&#39;s cassette technology such as 3-head system and FRTS.<br><br>Equipped with the Flata Response Tuning System (FRTS) to find out the optimum bias value of the tape.<br>In FRTS, test signals from the built-in 400 Hz and 8 kHz hybrid oscillator are recorded and played back immediately. The 400 Hz playback level is indicated by the Lch VU meter, and the 8 kHz playback level is indicated by the Rch VU meter. By adjusting the left and right meters to the same level with the bias fine adjustment knob, a flat bias value of frequency characteristics can be obtained.<br>The variable range is ± 20% for LH ・ CrO2 position and ± 10% for FeCr position.<br><br>Equipped with a double-needle meter that allows precise recording level settings, enabling simultaneous peak and VU reading to ensure the widest possible dynamic range.<br>The peak meter has a final characteristic of 10m/sec, recovery time of 1.5 sec, -40dB to + 10 dB for easy reading from weak level to high level. In addition, the peak and VU can be switched with the ON-OFF operation button.<br><br>Equipped with a peak hold mechanism to hold the maximum value of the peak meter.<br>If the peak hold button is turned ON, the peak level indication of the input signal can be held for 30 minutes (- 1 dB). If a larger signal is received during peak hold, the maximum peak is indicated and the signal is held continuously.<br>The circuit configuration uses a 4-stage operational amplifier and FET.<br><br>It is equipped with Rec calibration to correct the sensitivity of each tape.<br><br>Equipped with MPX filter.<br><br>The head uses a 3-head system with a newly developed CVC (Combination V-Cut) head.<br>By designing the recording and playback heads to appropriate gap lengths (recording gap : 4 μ m, playback gap : 1 μ m), we have extended the high-frequency characteristics, greatly improving the SN ratio and dynamic range.<br>The CVC head is a combination type to overcome the technical condition of cassette half, and adopts a twin peak head to keep good head touch with the tape. In addition, the contour effect (low-frequency waviness) that occurred in the conventional combination head is reduced by V-Cut in the core of the reproducing head, and low-frequency characteristics are improved. In addition, the head uses ultra-hard ferrite with excellent abrasion resistance and high-frequency characteristics.<br><br>The mechanism uses a dual motor drive system, which eliminates the extra load on the capstan drive motor and drives the capstan and take-up reel separately.<br>The capstan drive motor uses a 38-pulse FG servo motor with excellent drift characteristics, temperature characteristics and aging variation, while the reel take-up drive motor uses a DC servo motor that changes the rotation between FWD and FF / REW.<br>In addition, we have adopted a high-precision flywheel with an eccentric center distance of 6 μ m and made it even more compact to make it easier to balance the flywheel. In addition, the accuracy of the capstan is reduced to 0.05 μ m and the clearance between the capstan and the bearing is kept accurate. The bearing is made of high-purity copper-based oil-less metal. The inside diameter is 1 μ m and the surface roughness is 0.2S. This realizes a high-precision transport section.<br><br>Equipped with a Dolby system.<br><br>A logical control circuit is used in the operation section to enable direct switching from F. F. or REW to FWD without pressing the stop button or direct change to the recording state.<br>In addition, we have adopted the Quick Review Queue for the first time for logical controls. It uses a plunger solenoid that prevents heat generation, and the operation button stroke is less than 1 mm.<br><br>You can perform a follow-up REC that allows you to record without stopping the tape even during playback.<br><br>Equipped with a safety lock mechanism that does not operate even if the operation button is pressed when the cassette lid is opened.<br><br>Equipped with a timer standby mechanism for repeated recording, and by connecting a separately sold timer, repeated absence recording is possible.<br><br>Equipped with a Rec Mute mechanism with a muting time indicator.<br><br>Separate level controls for microphone and line input enable mixing recording.<br><br>Equipped with Mic (L + R) jack capable of monaural recording with one microphone.<br><br>A line-in jack is mounted on the front.<br><br>It is equipped with a memory replay mechanism effective for repeated playback of tapes.<br><br>It has a playback volume.<br><br>Equipped with a pure electronic full autostop mechanism to prevent damage to tapes and mechanical devices.<br><br>An oil dump type upright cassette holder is adopted.<br><br>Equipped with a tape illumination lamp that makes it easy to visually check the remaining amount of tape.<br><br>Equipped with a sync operation mechanism, it is possible to start / stop the player and deck simultaneously when recording by connecting with Aiwa player with Rec Sync terminal.<br><br>There was a remote control unit and an audio handle for rack mounting sold separately.</p>
