				<p class="detail">CD player equipped with newly developed pulse 4D/A converter.<br><br>The D/A converter consists of a high-density linear converter system, a 45-bit noise-shaping digital filter and a pulse D/A converter.<br><br>The Pulse D/A converter consists of a current source and an electronic switch. It expresses music waveform by switching two values of 0 and 1 at high speed. By this, the amplitude level is always constant and changes only in the time axis direction. The PLM (Pulse Length Modulation) wave is output. By passing it through a low-pass filter, unwanted high-frequency noise outside the audio band is removed and music waveform is obtained.<br>To reduce quantization noise in the audible band up to 20 kHz, the pulse D/A converter is equipped with a multi-stage noise shaping operation that employs 64 times oversampling and the Sony Extended Noise Shaping method. Oversampling reduces quantization noise in the audible band by increasing the sampling frequency. Noise shaping reduces quantization noise in the audible band by feeding back the requantization error to the input side when the number of bits is reduced. These technologies ensure a high dynamic range.<br>The pulse D/A converter operates at 45 mega pulses per second, and it completely eliminates differential non-linear distortion, glitch, and 0 cross distortion, which were difficult with conventional methods.<br><br>The CDP-591 uses a single-mode pulse D/A converter. A single pulse D/A converter provides a 4D/A output that outputs positive-phase and negative-phase LR signals.<br><br>To take advantage of the pulse D/A converter, the high-density linear converter system is equipped with a 45-bit noise-shaping digital filter in the front stage.<br>This circuit achieves a high dynamic range by performing a highly accurate oversampling operation and a first order noise-shaping operation on the operation result.<br><br>A direct digital sink is included to eliminate jittering issues.<br>In this system, the master clock is formed on the same chip as the pulse D/A converter, and jitter is eliminated in principle by eliminating jitter immediately before the electronic switch, which is the final stage of the pulse D/A converter.<br><br>The servo circuit is equipped with S Servo III.<br>In the S Servo III, the high-frequency noise component of the servo current is removed with a low-pass filter to supply a smooth servo current, which stabilizes the power supply from the power supply and prevents adverse effects on sound quality.<br><br>A digital CLV servo is installed in the drive system servo circuit that controls disk rotation.<br>The digital CLV servo detects the rotation of the spindle motor and controls it with 10-bit resolution to maintain an accurate linear velocity regardless of the disk&#39;s inner or outer circumference. It also detects the difference in inertial mass between the 12 cm CD and 8 cm CD disks to drive more appropriately.<br><br>Low noise and high stability are achieved by incorporating an RF amplifier in the pickup section.<br><br>The digital signal processing LSI uses the fourth generation LSI for the Sony CD player. Previously external RAM has been upgraded to a capacity of 32 kbit and built into the digital signal processing LSI. The precision of the signal processing capability is further enhanced by adopting the strict 6-fold error correction method.<br><br></p>

            <p class="detail">It has a custom edit function and nine functions : peak search, time edit, just edit, program edit, multidisk program, link edit, time fade, variable fade, and manual fader.<br><br>In peak search, all songs are searched at high speed, and they are repeatedly played for about 4 seconds before and after the point where the volume level is highest.<br><br>Time Edit enables efficient editing of the A-side and B-side when recording tapes.<br>If you want to edit to fit the length of your tape, use the TIME SET button or AMS button to set the length of the tape (you can also use the direct key to set the length in seconds). Press the Edit button. First, program from the first song for side A. When you encounter a time-over song, select the longest song that fits within the time. Then press the Edit button to edit side B.<br>Also, if you select and edit a half disk with the AMS button, tracks are distributed so that the A side and B side of the tape are about the same length without changing the order of the songs.<br><br>Just Edit is an evolution of Time Edit. It automatically finds and programs the combination of songs closest to the specified time.<br>You can set the A side and B side at the same time as in Time Edit.<br><br>Program Edit allows you to manually edit your favorite songs in any order.<br>With the AMS key or direct key, you can program your favorite songs in any order while checking the accumulated time. If you turn on Auto Space at this time, you can edit each song by adding a 3-second blank to the playing time. When you press the pause button, you can program the A side and then the B side together.<br><br>Multidisk programs allow you to edit across multiple disks.<br>When you program in program mode and open the tray, the display &quot;MULTI PGM&quot; appears and the program automatically moves to a multi-disc program. You can program up to 6 discs (24 songs). You can also program poses in the middle of the program.<br><br>Link Edit allows you to add music to the remaining tapes from Time Edit or Just Edit.<br>If you have programmed all songs and there is room for more songs within the editing time, the track number of the song to be entered and the LINK display will blink, and you can add a song by reselecting from the songs with the blinking track number.<br>Link-edit also allows you to swap disks and continue editing.<br><br>Time Fade allows you to fade out at a specified time, which can be set with the TIME SET button or the AMS button.<br><br>You can set the fade-in / fade-out time for the variable fade from 2 seconds to 10 seconds in units of 1 second.<br><br>The manual fader allows you to fade in and fade out at the desired location.<br><br></p>
            
            <hr><br><p class="detail">It is equipped with a delete play function so that you can play continuously with only the music you want to listen to. If you delete unnecessary music in shuffle mode and then switch to continue mode to play, you can skip that music and play the next one.<br>In addition, it is equipped with a 99 track delete shuffle function so that you can leave only your favorite music and play it randomly.<br><br>Equipped with Music Scan, you can play only the beginning part of a song one after another for 10 seconds.<br><br>Up to 24 songs can be played in a program, and 7-mode repeat of 1 song / whole song / part / program / delete play / shuffle / delete shuffle is installed.<br><br>The display section has a 20-track music calendar.<br><br>Equipped with an optical digital output.<br><br>Equipped with two line-out terminals, fixed and variable.<br>In addition, it is equipped with a headphone terminal with a lineout linked volume that flashes when the remote control is operated.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.<br>This remote control is equipped with an autospace function, which adjusts the space between songs to silence space of about 3 seconds.</p>
