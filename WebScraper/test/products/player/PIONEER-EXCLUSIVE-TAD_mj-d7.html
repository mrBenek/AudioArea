				<p class="detail">The MD deck pursues high sound quality and high function to enjoy MD as audio.<br><br>It is equipped with Audio-Signal Reactive Control-System (ASRAC SYSTEM), an audio compression technology evolved from ATRAC.<br>The ATRAC, an MD format audio compression method, the input signal is divided into three frequency bands, and then the data is organized and compressed based on the minimum audibility characteristics and masking effect before recording. However, this uniform masking method has limitations in reproducing the subtle nuances of music.<br>The ASRAC SYSTEM uses DSP technology to analyze the frequencies of input signals in real-time and control them so that the optimum masking characteristics for the input signals are always selected in each band. In addition, by allocating more data to the bands that contain a lot of music signals during compression, sound data that has been organized until now can be compressed and recorded without being truncated. This increases the expressive power of music in the sense of hearing and enables more faithful recording of subtle nuances.<br>Discs recorded with the ASRAC SYSTEM are compatible with other MD decks, portable MD, MD-car stereos, and other MD players.<br><br>Equipped with Pioneer&#39;s original digital NR.<br>Digital NR automatically detects the noise level contained in the input signal in real time and cuts only the hissing without degrading the sound quality. This enables recording and playback of relatively noisy input sources, such as reprinted CDs, cassettes, and broadcast signals from analog sources, with less noise.<br>Digital NR can also be used to play discs recorded on other MD decks, so you can enjoy low-noise playback.<br>This function supports 44.1 kHz sampling for digital recording.<br><br>Pioneer&#39;s original Legato link conversion is installed for the first time as an MD deck. It reproduces the frequency component of 20 khz or more, which is cut in the format of digital recording, up to 40 khz, and realizes natural music playback closer to the original sound.<br><br>Pioneer&#39;s original design philosophy, Z-concept, has been introduced in pursuit of improved signal reading accuracy, accurate signal transmission, and accurate signal conversion.<br>The MJ-D7 uses an Accurate Servo Circuit based on the Z-concept to eliminate unnecessary high-frequency noise in the disk drive rotation control section, thereby eliminating the influence of high-frequency noise and realizing a stable circuit.<br>We have also succeeded in shortening signal transmission paths and improving signal conversion accuracy.<br><br>Equipped with a digital REC volume, it is possible to adjust the recording level of the music signal (+ 12 dB to -48dB) even when the digital source is connected digitally.<br>This enables digital recording of CDs of various levels at the same level, and Pioneer&#39;s advanced technology minimizes the loss of sound quality caused by level adjustment.<br><br>It is equipped with a synchronous REC function. If you want to record only one song, such as a single CD, you can record one song synchronously, or record all songs synchronously until all songs are finished. Both digital input and analog input can be set with one button.<br><br>Equipped with a recovery REC function, you can record backward from the REC pause state to the part 2 seconds before.<br>By using this function, if you release the REC pause within 2 seconds after the start of the song you want to record in air check, etc., you can record clearly from the beginning of the song.<br><br>The input terminal is equipped with two optical digital systems, one coaxial digital system and one analog system, and the output terminal is equipped with one optical digital system, one coaxial digital system and one analog system.<br>With a built-in sampling recorder, it is compatible with various sources as a master recorder.<br><br>3-pole AC inlet extra thick cord is used for the power cord.<br><br>It is equipped with functions such as time slip, monaural long recording, katakana / alphabet / number name input, move, undo, erase and combine.<br><br>It is equipped with a name clip function so that names (disc names and song names) that have already been entered can be memorized and copied to other songs as many times as you want. To protect copyright, names contained in a play-only MD cannot be copied.<br><br>It has a medley playback function.<br>This function fades out the end of a song and plays all songs continuously like a medley of one song while connecting the songs smoothly.<br><br>Equipped with a timer fade-in function, you can start a performance by gradually increasing the volume from a small sound when playing a timer using a commercially available timer.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
