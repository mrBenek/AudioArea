				<p class="detail">A tape deck equipped with excellent mechanisms such as dbx, closed loop dual capstan, and EE tape support.<br><br>Dbx is installed as a noise reduction system.<br>When recording sound that exceeds the dynamic range of the tape, the dbx system compresses the sound level in the form of the original sound to 1 / 2 in decibels. When playing back the sound, the level of the sound is doubled and returned to the original level. This reduces noise by 30 to 40 dB in all audio frequency bands. In addition, the dynamic range of the transmission system is expanded, the saturation point of the recording level is raised by 7 to 10 dB as the effective value, level matching and pilot tone are unnecessary because linear logarithmic compression and expansion are carried out, and transient error does not occur even in the case of sudden attack sound.<br>In addition, the RMS level sensor ensures that the system operates correctly even if the audio signal is out of phase during transmission.<br><br>The X-1000R is equipped with a new system of bias oscillation circuit and equalizer circuit EE tapes using magnetic materials for high-density recording, and a new type of high-hardness permalloy head is used for recording and playback, providing excellent sound quality with little change over time.<br>In addition, the erasing head adopts a double gap with high erasing effect to cope with the large residual magnetic flux density of the EE tape.<br><br>In order to make the most of the performance of EE tape, it is equipped with a selector position for EE tape with bias and equalizer set.<br><br>The mechanism uses a dual capstan system in which two pairs of capstan and pinch rollers sandwich the tape and drive it. The erasing head is located outside each capstan shaft so that the tension in the loop is always constant and the tape span is shortened.<br>As a result, both forward and reverse tape travel is stabilized, and modulation noise and flutter components are greatly reduced.<br><br>A full-tension servo system is installed to stabilize the running system. As a result, the photointerrupter linked to the tension arm functions to operate the tension servo correctly even when any tape is running, and a constant tape tension is always obtained. This ensures extremely stable running.<br>Since this mechanism is installed on the left and right tension arms respectively, it operates at the beginning and end of tape winding, forward rotation, reverse rotation, fast forward and rewind operations, and automatically servocontrol the tension. It also detects the rotation speed of the フーテージローラー, controls the tension servo, and saves the early winding speed. This stabilizes the tape running and protects the tape.<br><br>Equipped with an editing mechanism by microcomputer control.<br><br>A 5-digit LED linear electronic counter is used for the counter, which displays in hours, minutes, and seconds.<br>The counter addition / reduction system is a unique mechanism of TEAC in which the microcomputer judges the rotation direction of forward / reverse rotation at the moment the フーテージローラー rotates. This linear electronic counter realizes the total recording time, accurate time measurement of songs, accurate second setting of auto-spacer, location search, and timing when recording starts.<br>It also functions as a program counter. When the PROGRAM button is pressed, the time of the song is optionally measured and displayed with the tape running regardless of forward or reverse rotation. At this time, the display before pressing the PROGRAM button is memorized by the microcomputer and displayed again when the PROGRAM is released.<br><br>Equipped with STZ (Search to Zero) function, pressing the STZ button returns the tape from anywhere on the tape to the counter 0 display.<br>The microcomputer determines whether to fast forward or rewind the tape and selects the shorter one in terms of distance. When the display approaches 0, the electromagnetic brake is automatically applied and the tape stops while slowing down.<br><br>The STC (Search to Cue) function allows the microcomputer to memorize the position where the CUE button is pressed and to forward or rewind the tape to that position. The STC button operates directly regardless of the mode of operation of the deck.<br>You can also use the Tape Lifter to perform STC. If you raise the lifter to queue the tape, and then lower the lifter at the point where you want to stop, the microcomputer can store the data and use the STC to search for it.<br><br>Auto Spacer allows you to create up to 8 seconds of silent recording space, or press Rec Mute twice to make this space infinite.<br><br>By connecting the teac cassette deck (C-2X, C-3X, C-4X, C-3RX, V-7, V-8) with an optional cord (WR-100), it is possible to record into a cassette in synchronization.<br>When you play the X-1000R, the cassette deck changes from Rec Pause to Rec/Play.<br><br>A full-scale 6-head configuration has been adopted in which each head for recording, playback and erasing is independent for both back and forth operations.<br><br>Equipped with a motion sensing mechanism for smooth transition from quick winding to play operation.<br><br>Equipped with 1-3, 4-2 track selection queue mechanism.<br><br>It is equipped with a real-time pose in which the rise from the recorded pose is smooth.<br><br>Equipped with a pitch control mechanism that works for both recording and playback.<br><br>It uses an electromagnetic brake to protect the tape.<br><br>Equipped with an independent timer switch capable of reverse timer recording.<br><br>Equipped with a Oatley berth counter repeat mechanism capable of endless regeneration.<br><br>Equipped with a Rec Mute mechanism.<br><br>It is equipped with a block repeat mechanism that repeatedly reproduces an arbitrary section.<br><br>There are 2 color variations, X-1000R and X-1000RBL.<br>X-1000R is sold separately with a wood case, and X-1000RBL is equipped with a wood case as standard.</p>
