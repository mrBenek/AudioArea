				<p class="detail">A stereo cassette deck equipped with Dolby S.<br><br>The Dolby S type has a noise reduction effect of less than 40% compared to the conventional Dolby C noise reduction of 20 dB.<br>In the high-frequency range, the noise can be reduced by 24 dB. In addition, low-frequency noise, which was not addressed by conventional NR systems, can be reduced by 10 dB.<br>In addition, the noise reduction effect, which is shown in the number, and the unnatural feeling of hearing due to breathing, which tends to occur when a sound rises suddenly, has been improved.<br><br>Closed loop dual capstan drive system is adopted for the mechanical part.<br>By installing two capstan at the front and back of the head and applying a constant tension, reliable head touch is obtained, and the wow flutter characteristics are improved and noise generation due to tape swinging is prevented.<br><br>A hard permalloy head with excellent wear characteristics is used for the read / write head.<br>In addition, PC-OCC (single-crystal high-purity oxygen-free copper), which is effective in reducing transmission loss, is used in the winding to prevent degradation of high-frequency characteristics and to minimize transmission loss of the original signal to improve distortion characteristics.<br><br>The erasing head is equipped with a SENDUST alloy chip erasing head with a ceramic guard. There is no contact demagnetization in the high frequency range. The synergistic effect of the ceramic guard and multilayer structure realizes high bias erasing for the first time as an erasing head using SENDUST.<br><br>The bias and wrap coil used in the playback equalizer have been removed, and a bias band noise suppressor (discrete circuit) has been incorporated in the playback equalizer circuit.<br>As a result, we have succeeded in improving the S / N ratio by 3 db when the filter is flat compared with the conventional reproduction equalizer.<br><br>The head base is made of 1.2 mm thick stainless steel and brass boss, which is hard to be deformed due to high rigidity, and prevents azimuth slippage.<br><br>It is equipped with A. T. C. S. and bias preset which makes fine adjustment of difficult bias level automatically by microcomputer.<br>Using signals of 400 Hz and 12.5 kHz, the bias level is changed by 16 steps and recorded. At the same time, the proper bias value is detected according to each output level. Recording at the optimum bias value is possible.<br>In addition, the tape sensitivity is automatically adjusted at 400 Hz to compensate for different recording sensitivities for each tape.<br><br>Tape path stabilizer is adopted.<br><br>Equipped with a CD peak search function.</p>
