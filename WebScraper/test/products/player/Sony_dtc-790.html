				<p class="detail">DAT deck with SBM recording function and 44.1 kHz analog input recording.<br><br>A 2D. D. + reel motor mechanism is adopted, and independent direct drive motors are used for the capstan and the head drum rotation, which are key points of the tape drive mechanism, respectively, and a special motor is used for the reel.<br><br>The A/D converter is equipped with a pulse A/D converter with a built-in 1-bit modulator, and achieves a theoretical S / N ratio of 119 dB by performing high-speed, high-precision operations with 64 x oversampling and 5th order noise shaping.<br>In addition, by separating it from the decimation filter that performs the digital operation to return the sampling rate and making it independent, the influence of noise on the modulator that handles analog signals can be reduced.<br><br>Equipped with SBM (Super Bit Mapping) digital filter.<br>SBM achieves significant noise reduction by shifting quantization noise that is uniformly distributed within the audible band to higher frequencies that are difficult to hear due to human audibility characteristics, and by recoding low-order 4-bit information that is normally truncated to high-order 16-bit information using the principle of noise shaping.<br>The SBM digital filter uses the built-in decimation filter to reduce aliasing noise and uses the SBM to convert the 24-bit data output from the decimation filter into 16-bit data almost as it is, enabling high-quality recording.<br><br>The D/A converter employs an advanced pulse D/A converter that uses Sony&#39;s proprietary high-precision calculation method to achieve higher pulse output density.<br>By using single-chip ICs with single-channel 4D/A outputs and double-channel 8D/A outputs, and performing complimentary service PLM operation (differential-synthesis of two pulse wave outputs that are complementary to each other), the generation of harmonic distortion is reduced.<br><br>Equipped with subcode function, start ID can be recorded and deleted.<br>The Start ID is a subcode that indicates the beginning of a song. It is equipped with two modes : Auto, which is automatically written at the start of a song, and Manual, which can be written at any position you like (excluding immediately after the Start ID, 9 seconds in SP mode, and 18 seconds in LP mode).<br><br>It is equipped with a rehearse function for writing the start ID manually during playback.<br>During the rehearsal, you can move the point back and forth in 0.3 second increments while listening to and confirming the sound. The movement time is displayed on the display and can be set while confirming.<br>In addition, the start ID that has already been written can be corrected while rehearsing.<br><br>You can assign a program number to the Start ID, and you can directly select a song by simply specifying the number when playing it. The program number is automatically assigned when recording and can be changed by renumbering.<br><br>To correct program numbers that have become uneven by adding or deleting the start ID, it is possible to renumber the numbers from the beginning of the tape with one touch.<br><br>It is compatible with SCMS (serial copy management system) and allows digital to digital recording for only one generation using CD software as master. When only analog input / output terminal is used, repeated recording is possible without restriction of SCMS.<br><br>In addition to the conventional 48 kHz mode (standard) and 32 kHz ・ LP mode, the analog input mode is equipped with a new 44.1 kHz mode, making it possible to record in the same way as the CD format.<br><br>Equipped with Digital Fade In / Out. Each fade in / out time can be finely set in the range of 1 to 15 seconds. In addition, since it is linked with the pause function, it can be used when editing and recording a compact cassette from a DAT tape as a master.<br><br>The digital peak margin display shows how much more room is left in the recording level in dB. The level can be adjusted to take advantage of the wide dynamic range.<br><br>Equipped with a CD Q-code decoding function, when recording a CD with digital input, it is possible to decode the Q-code, which is information between songs on the digital interface, and automatically write an accurate start ID.<br><br>A dot-matrix display is used for the display.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
