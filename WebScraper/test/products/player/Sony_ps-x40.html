				<p class="detail">A full auto player developed by inheriting the technology of the high-grade machine.<br><br>In order to eliminate uneven torque, it is equipped with a simple linear BSL (slotless) motor that does not require a brush or slot. Since slots that cause cogging are eliminated, uneven torque is minimized and smooth and quiet rotation is realized.<br>In addition, high torque is obtained due to high efficiency, and reliability and durability are also improved.<br><br>The velocity detection section of the servo system adopts a Magne-disk velocity detection method developed by introducing precision measurement technology of Sony Magne-scale.<br>In this method, a magnetic material is coated on the inner wall of the outer periphery of the turntable, which has a wide rotating area, and 512 wave detection signals are magnetized. The average value of these signals is detected by a multi-gap head, and control commands are sent to the servo system.<br>In addition, since the generated signal has a high frequency of approximately 284 Hz at 33 1/3rpm, servo compensation can be performed up to relatively high frequencies of flutter components.<br><br>Magnedisk A crystal lock is adopted by adding a phase control circuit of crystal oscillation to the detected speed servo circuit. By phase locking the detected signal, not only initial drift due to self-heat generation of the body, but also rotational speed deviation due to voltage fluctuation due to self-heat generation and rotational speed decrease due to needle pressure load are reduced, and excellent rotational characteristics are obtained.<br><br>The arm pipe section is made of a special aluminum alloy with greatly increased rigidity. By adopting a J-shape with high bending strength, rigidity approximately 8 times that of conventional aluminum pipes is obtained.<br>In addition, by adopting an integrated structure from the neck cylinder section to the bearing section, unnecessary joints are eliminated and resonance factors caused by joint looseness are eliminated.<br><br>The bearings use a Longs pan bearing shaft supported by a single straight shaft to prevent play caused by ball bearings. This minimizes movement at the operating point.<br>In addition, a tapered mirror finish of hardened cemented carbide with a diameter of 5 mm is used for the pivot shaft to improve contact with precision radial bearings and provide high rigidity support.<br><br>The SBMC is used for the cabinet because internal loss is larger than metal and the structure with high precision and strength can be easily obtained.<br><br>It uses a large insulator filled with gel-like high-viscoelastic material in a rubber cup.<br>The material filled in this insulator is very flexible, has high internal losses, and has moderate spring elasticity, which enables effective vibration absorption.<br>In addition, the height of this insulator can be adjusted to keep the cabinet horizontal, and the center of gravity is lowered to further improve stability.<br><br>Equipped with a full auto mechanism to improve safety, even if the tone arm is forced to stop by hand during lead-in or return, the auto mechanism will be disconnected instantly and no burden will be placed on the mechanism.<br>Other features include an electronic memory circuit that responds faithfully to continuous operation instructions, quick lead-in and auto-cut operations, and a front control that can be operated even when the dust cover is closed.<br><br>MM type cartridge XL-15 is attached to the cartridge.</p>
