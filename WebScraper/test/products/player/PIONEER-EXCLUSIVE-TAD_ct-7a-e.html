				<p class="detail">A front-operated stereo cassette deck equipped with a timer recording standby mechanism.<br><br>By connecting a timer and setting the control lever to recording or playback standby (with the pause button pressed), the tape can be started at the desired time.<br>Since the pinch roller is separated from the capstan during standby, there is no need to worry about damaging the mechanism or tape.<br>A commercially available timer can be used.<br><br>In order to make it easier to see the tape running, the mechanism is tilted by 30 degrees.<br>In this condition, in order to under this condition, we have adopted an electronically controlled DC motor with large torque that is not affected by voltage fluctuations, and a high-precision capstan with roundness of 0.1 μ or less.<br><br>It is equipped with a peak indicator that combines a light-emitting diode and electronic circuit that quickly responds to + 5 dB level in several mmsec.<br>This quickly reacts to the instantaneous peak level of the recording source and turns on to warn that the recording level is over.<br><br>It has a built-in Dolby System that greatly reduces tape hissing without compromising the sound quality of the recording source. When the Dolby System is ON, the indicator lamp lights.<br><br>In order to bring out the characteristics of each tape such as chrome tape, low-noise tape and standard tape, it is equipped with an independent switchable tape selector with two levels of bias and two levels of equalizer.<br>A new equalizer circuit with a time constant of 70 μ s that improves S/N by 4.5 dB in the high-frequency range is also used for chrome tapes. When using general low-noise tapes, both the bias and equalizer are set to STD. When using chrome tapes, both the bias and equalizer are set to CrO.<sub>2</sub>For more information.<br>You can enjoy recording and playback that demonstrate the characteristics of each tape in terms of frequency characteristics and distortion factor.<br><br>It is equipped with a recording amplifier with a large dynamic margin, and is designed to use a professional standard microphone with a compatible microphone impedance, so it is very useful for live recording.<br><br>The head uses a ferrite solid head with less wear and long life.<br>Since the contact surface with the tape is made of a hard material unique to ferrite and carefully mirror-finished, sound skipping due to dust adhesion is less and stable sound quality can be obtained.<br><br>In order to facilitate cleaning of the cassette compartment set at 30 degrees, we have installed a maintenance skylight at the top of the bonnet where a large head eraser can be used.<br>This makes maintenance of the head and travel system easy.<br><br>It is equipped with a memory rewind switch. When this switch is turned ON, the start point [000] of the tape counter is memorized, played and recorded, and rewound after that, the tape stops at the [999] position.<br>This mechanism is convenient when you want to repeatedly listen to the same music recorded in the middle of the tape.<br><br>Equipped with a skip button that allows you to fast-forward at twice the speed while listening to monkey talk.<br><br>The tape counter has a light lamp.</p>
