				<p class="detail">Stereo cassette deck with independent 3-head configuration.<br><br>Closed-loop dual capstan system is adopted for the mechanism part.<br>In this system, capstan and pinch rollers are arranged on both sides of the independent head to keep the tension until the end of winding of the tape constant and to realize stable head touch.<br>The TD-V631 is equipped with high-precision DC motors for the capstan, reel, and mechanism drive, respectively. The large capstan uses a twin belt drive system with two belts to obtain a stable and strong driving force. In addition, by using aluminum die-cast for the mechanical base, positioning accuracy and parallelism of main parts related to mechanical running are greatly improved. At the same time, tape running is stabilized, disturbance vibration is less transmitted to the head, and modulation noise is reduced.<br><br>The head section is equipped with independent structure 3 heads that use fine amorphous heads for recording and playback respectively.<br>The Fine Amorphous Head combines the characteristics of the SA head, which has excellent magnetic characteristics and abrasion resistance, with the amorphous head, which has excellent high-frequency characteristics, and realizes well-balanced head characteristics.<br>In addition, PC-OCC (single-crystal high-purity oxygen-free copper material) with greatly reduced signal loss is used for the head winding and lead wire, realizing pure transmission.<br><br>In order to eliminate internal interference that adversely affects sound quality, we have adopted a structure in which the three blocks of power supply, amplifier, and control are separated independently. In this structure, the microcomputer and display are concentrated in one place, and the delicate amplifier is separated from each circuit board by the inner chassis. In addition, the power supply is separated by the center chassis to eliminate magnetic retention from the power transformer.<br><br>Thorough measures are taken to eliminate unnecessary vibration and resonance.<br>First of all, the inner chassis is reinforced from the inside. In addition, the base of the front panel is made of a high-density, high-rigidity mold material that is strong against resonance and difficult to transmit vibration. This mold material is about 1.5 times heavier and 1.7 times more rigid than conventional materials. It is effective against vibration. In addition, the mechanical buttons are made of extruded aluminum material and the switch plate are made of aluminum material to minimize micro vibration.<br>We have also adopted a large insulator as a countermeasure against external vibration.<br><br>A newly developed half-shell stabilizer is used to reduce vibration of the cassette half itself.<br><br>Equipped with a direct input terminal, direct recording at the shortest distance eliminates external influences as much as possible.<br><br>The input selector and volume are designed to be controlled by the remote bar close to the rear panel input jacks so that the signal path is as short as possible to avoid noise.<br><br>Equipped with Dolby B/C NR as a noise reduction system.<br><br>Equipped with the Dolby HX-PRO, it realizes flat frequency characteristics by varying the bias amount according to the change of the music signal during recording, and greatly improves high-frequency characteristics by reducing the level change and distortion of the low-frequency signal.<br><br>The power supply section employs a low output impedance with ± tracking control using a large transformer and a large capacitor.<br>In this power supply circuit, the stability of the amplifier is maintained by operating the positive side and the negative side in cooperation so that the ground potential is always 0. In addition, the combination of a high-gain voltage comparison circuit and a constant-current control circuit with excellent high-frequency characteristics lowers the output impedance to less than 1m Ω in the audio frequency band and realizes a stabilized power supply that is resistant to complicated changes in music signals and disturbance noise.<br><br>The audio circuit uses a DC amplifier configuration that eliminates capacitors as much as possible from the circuit for both recording and playback.<br><br>Equipped with a large FL display.<br>This display features digital peaks that can be read numerically as peak levels, a memory stop mechanism that automatically stops when the memory button is pressed for fast forward or rewind, and an indication of the remaining time of the tape.<br><br>Equipped with an auto monitor function, the sound is automatically switched to the sound of the tape immediately after recording when recording, and to the sound of the source when waiting in a pause.<br><br>Gold-plated input / output terminal and power cord with polarity display are adopted.<br><br>Equipped with a bias adjustment function.<br><br>Equipped with a timer start mechanism, and by connecting an optional timer, it is possible to record absence and play an alarm clock.<br><br>Equipped with MPX filter.<br><br>Equipped with a headphone port with volume.<br><br>Equipped with synchronized recording terminal.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
