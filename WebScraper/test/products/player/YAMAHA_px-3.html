				<p class="detail">This linear tracking player has further improved stability and operability by utilizing the know-how gained through the development of the PX-1 and PX-2.<br><br>The tone arm is equipped with a linear tracking servo system.<br>There is a non-contact optical tracking error sensor inside the arm base. When even a small amount of shutter rotation (arm rotation) occurs, an unbalanced voltage is generated in CDs. This voltage is sent to a DC coreless servo motor, which is compared and amplified, and drives the arm base, returning the tracking error to 0.<br>This servo circuit has a dead zone of ± 0.5 mm. If the eccentricity of the record is 0.5 mm or less, only forward movement is performed, and useless arm base movement is suppressed.<br>In addition, the PX-3 uses the same design as the PX-2, such as a servo motor that operates only when the arm is down, a servo motor that can handle the rough pitch of the lead-out groove of the disk with a margin of three times, and an anti-vibration design that suppresses noise and vibration of the arm base drive part.<br><br>The tone arm uses Yamaha&#39;s original ARS (anti-resonance straight) arm.<br>In order to thoroughly suppress resonance in this arm, know-how such as using materials with high rigidity and improving the precision of processing and assembly of parts has been invested.<br>In addition, in order to realize a structure that is less susceptible to vibration, a fully symmetrical design with no offset angle or finger hook is adopted. In addition, the span between the pivots is widened to suppress backlash and reduce the cause of part resonance. The balance weight is made into a large rectangular shape close to the fulcrum to increase the moment of inertia around the rotation axis to suppress vibration. In addition, the rigidity is increased by making the pipe holder part, which is subject to maximum stress, a double structure up to 30 mm in front.<br><br>For needle pressure application of the tone arm, sliding weight system of PX-2 and P series and copper type is adopted.<br>Compared with the general Lee Ka-eun Tarring method, this method is superior in ease of needle pressure adjustment, fineness and accuracy, and has the advantage that the effective mass increases or decreases with the increase or decrease of the needle pressure.<br><br>The height of the tone arm part can be adjusted by ± 4 mm.<br><br>Pure aluminum forged head shell is adopted.<br>The cable uses a low-impedance PU code NEGLEX #2496 with 23 - and 26-core lead wires in a double-cylinder structure, and the pin plugs are gold-plated.<br><br>A DC4-phase 8-pole coreless motor is used for the rotating system motor.<br>It is a coreless type without cogging in principle, and uses a non-contact Hall element for polarity detection, reducing mechanical and electrical noise.<br><br>The FG (frequency generator) that detects rotating systems is an all-round integration type in which both the magnet pattern and the detection coil are placed over the entire circumference of the motor. Therefore, it can offset the eccentricity of the magnetization pattern and coil, and pitch error, and can obtain highly accurate detection signals.<br>The signal detected by the FG is compared with the reference voltage and compared in phase with a crystal oscillator with a pitch accuracy of 20 ppm or less (quartz lock), and is fed back to the motor drive to maintain a constant speed.<br><br>Moment of inertia 210 kg ・ cm for turntable<sup>2</sup>Aluminum die-cast heavy duty turntable is adopted.<br><br>The operation system is equipped with a full auto function composed mainly of YAMAHA LOGIC LSI (YM-294) which is the same as that used for PX-2.<br>It is equipped with a one touch, 2-size, electronically controlled full auto system. It integrates two buttons, the Play button and the record size selector. When you press either the 17 cm or 30 cm button, it automatically reads in to the beginning of the first track. This is a system common to the PX series. The read-in position is read out by a 3-bit photosensor consisting of three photo interrupters fixed on the rear base and a logic shack fixed on the tone arm base.<br><br>In the down operation of the arm, a signal is sent from the LSI to the plunger which drives the oil dump type arm lifter. In addition, the mini plunger restricts the tone arm only during the down operation to prevent the flow from right and left.<br>If you want to stop playing in the middle of a song, press the cut button and the arm will move up by the signal from the LSI.<br><br>The auto return function takes advantage of the wide pitch of the lead-out groove. When the 3-bit photo sensor senses that the arm moves faster, the auto return function is automatically activated.<br>Repeat operation is a repetition of auto return and auto lead-in.<br><br>Cabinet is made of high density BMC (Bulk Molding Compound) which is strong against howling.<br>In addition, the dust cover is 4 mm thick and 1.1 kg acrylic.<br><br>We have adopted a spring / rubber composite insulator that combines a spring with a high anti-vibration effect in the low frequency range and a rubber effective in the high frequency range.</p>
