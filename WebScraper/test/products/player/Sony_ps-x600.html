				<p class="detail">A full auto player system equipped with a biotracer and straight arm.<br>There were 2 types of variations, PS-X600 with no cartridge and PS-X600C with MM type cartridge XL-20.<br><br>The tone arm employs a microcomputer that makes hundreds of logical decisions in less than 1/1000 second, and a biotracer that electronically controls its motion with speed and position detection sensors and linear motors.<br>With this biotracer, the low-frequency resonance peak can be suppressed to less than 3 dB regardless of the type of cartridge used. At the same time, crosstalk is also improved. In addition, since it is a velocity sensor, the detection output becomes smaller at lower frequencies, and the feedback amount can be reduced. Furthermore, since velocity feedback is applied, vibration hardly occurs, and the structure is strong against howling and impact.<br><br>Equipped with an electronic needle pressure adjustment and an auto-inside four scan cellar, the needle pressure can be finely adjusted during record performance.<br><br>A contactless photoelectric auto record size selector is used to automatically select and queue the record size. This function also functions as a safety mechanism when a start instruction is issued without setting a record.<br><br>Two tone arm move buttons allow queuing to any position in the record.<br>In addition, fine adjustment of about 1 mm is also possible.<br><br>Since an electronic non-contact mechanism is adopted, silent operation without mechanical sound is realized.<br>In addition, it has a built-in muting mechanism linked to the arm lifter, eliminating the shock noise when the needle tip touches the record.<br><br>It uses a simple linear BSL (slotless) motor that does not require a brush or slot. By eliminating the slot that causes cogging, torque unevenness is reduced and quiet and smooth rotation is realized.<br>In addition, high torque is obtained due to high efficiency, and reliability and durability are improved.<br><br>The magnetic disk speed detection method is adopted for the speed detection of the servo circuit. The multi-gap head detects the average value of the detection signal, which is densely magnetized on the turntable, and captures minute changes in the rotational speed.<br>33 Since the generated signal has a high frequency of approximately 284 Hz at 1/3rpm, servo compensation can be performed up to relatively high frequencies among flutter components.<br><br>The speed signal obtained by the magnet-disk speed detection is compared with the reference signal and controlled to maintain the correct rotational speed. However, the temperature characteristics of the element used in this case may affect accurate servo control. In order to improve this, we have adopted a quartz lock that controls the phase of the detected signal.<br>By taking advantage of the high oscillation precision of quartz crystal, stable rotational characteristics that are resistant to changes in ambient temperature, power supply voltage and frequency are obtained.<br><br>In the tone arm part, the joint part of each connection part is strengthened, and the vibration of the operating point of the bearing part is reduced to completely eliminate resonance.<br>A Longs pan bearing shaft supported by a single straight shaft with a long distance between fulcrums has been adopted in order to reduce play caused by the small clearance for rotating the ball bearing in the bearing section and to reduce movement of the operating point of the arm. This minimizes movement of the operating point even in the case of slight play in the bearing section.<br>The arm pipe is made of a special aluminum alloy with increased rigidity for increased strength. In addition, the arm pipe is tapered.<br><br>The SBMC cabinet has been adopted for the cabinet, which is less likely to resonate than metal, has high precision, and has high strength. In addition, the partial resonance is suppressed by reinforcing important parts in consideration of thickness and structure.<br>In addition, vibration is reduced by using a thick and strong dust cover.<br><br>We have adopted an insulator filled with gel-like dump material.<br><br>The separately sold synchronized remote control unit allows synchronized play with the cassette deck.</p>
