				<p class="detail">An MD recorder equipped with a 24 bit D. R. I. V. E. system with the aim of becoming a new standard as a digital sound recorder.<br><br>Equipped with 24 bit D. R. I. V. E., a further evolution of D. R. I. V. E., which is Kenwood&#39;s original digital technology.<br>Compared to the conventional 20-bit system, this system performs more detailed digital processing with 24-bit information. In addition, it combines two fixed filters and a continuously variable low-pass filter to monitor and control the input data as a whole, thereby achieving the minimum removal of quantization distortion.<br>This data is processed and recorded by ATRAC Ver4.5, which is a 24-bit audio compression technology placed immediately after the data, thereby improving the reproducibility of small signals.<br>On the output side, a D/A converter with 24-bit arithmetic processing is used to enable more accurate reproduction.<br><br>74 ac (Advanced C) to prevent jitter (fluctuation of time axis accuracy) from affecting sound quality.<sup>2</sup>MOS) type logic IC is used for oscillation and frequency division circuit, and high-speed operation with allowance is made to increase the purity of the clock and generate the clock with less jitter component.<br><br>Equipped with a digital REC volume that can be varied from + 12 dB to - ∞, even when you want to record your favorite songs from various CDs at random, you can create an easy-to-listen MD disc that matches the recording level of all songs.<br>You can also use the fade-in and fade-out functions for digital recording to create an original MD with your own recording effects. The fade time can vary from 1 second to 10 seconds.<br><br>It is equipped with a sampling rate converter that automatically converts 32 kHz or 48 kHz sources to 44.1 kHz. It can be converted to 44.1 kHz, which is the sampling frequency of MD, and recorded digitally using SCM.<br><br>The A/D converter is equipped with an A/D converter with 1-bit fourth order noise shaping and 20-bit resolution.<br><br>In addition to the adoption of a highly rigid aluminum mechanical base and frame, an air shield structure of 1.2 mm + 2.0 mm thick steel plate is adopted. This eliminates disk resonance caused by vibration and sound pressure, enabling higher-quality recording and reproduction.<br>In addition, the natural vibration of each structure is suppressed by the combination of different metals.<br><br>Equipped with CDTEXT display function, it is also possible to dub character information (TEXT information).<br>CDTEXT recording is limited to Kenwood Sync terminal SL-16 specification.<br><br>It is equipped with a Sound Synchro-Rec function, and recording starts automatically when an input sound is detected, making it possible to record without cutting off the head.<br>It is also equipped with functions such as auto-cut, which automatically adjusts the unrecorded portion between songs to 3 seconds, rec auto-pause, which detects the end of a song on a CD (during digital recording) and enters a pause state, memory rec, which can record a song about 6 seconds back, and auto-space, which keeps the interval between songs on a CD constant.<br><br>Equipped with a quick erase function, you can erase any number of songs at once or erase all songs at once.<br><br>Equipped with a track-erase function to erase the music being played.<br>If you accidentally delete a song, you can restore the deleted song by operating Edit Cancel.<br><br>It is equipped with functions such as Quick Move which can change the order of songs together and Track Move which can change one song.<br><br>It is equipped with a track combine capable of linking songs and a track divide capable of dividing a single song.<br><br>It is equipped with a title input function that allows you to enter up to 80 characters per song, up to a maximum of 1792 characters for the entire disc (fewer characters for English and numeric symbols when entering Katakana).<br>You can select groups of English capital letters / English small letters / numbers / various symbols / Katakana by using the character key.<br><br>It is equipped with a title search function to search by song name.<br><br>Supports monaural long-time recording.<br><br>A remote controller for title direct input is included.<br><br>Title input and label printing are possible by using the separately sold Cyber Tight CT-H90.</p>
