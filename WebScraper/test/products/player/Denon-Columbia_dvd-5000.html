				<p class="detail">A DVD player equipped with AL24 Processing and compatible with the THX ultra standard.<br><br>It is equipped with AL24 Processing, an original analog waveform reproduction technology.<br>AL24 Processing is an analog waveform reproduction technology that is a further evolution of Adaptive Line Pattern Harmonized Algorithm Processing. It further reduces quantization distortion and supports high-bit and high-sampling.<br>This circuit generates low-order 8-bit data through internal arithmetic processing by installing twice as many low-order data generation circuits as conventional ones. The high-order 16-bit data is added to the low-order 8-bit data to obtain 24-bit quality output. This complements signals lost when digital data is recorded on CDs and other media, and reproduces the sound with a smooth analog waveform that is as close as possible to the sound that should have existed before recording.<br>AL24 Processing supports 18 -, 20 -, and 24-bit digital input as well as 16-bit input, and 96 kHz sampling frequency.<br>In addition, we inherited an adaptive digital filter that automatically changes the cutoff band. When music data is generated, it is played flat to the ultra-high frequency just below fs/2 (fs : sampling frequency), and when pulse data is played back, it is possible to reproduce impulse response with little ringing by expanding the pass band.<br><br>The D/A converter is equipped with a 24-bit / 96 kHz sampling D/A converter and realizes high specifications by ultra-high precision conversion with 4 dac configuration.<br><br>Equipped with an HDCD decoder, it can play HDCD from HDCD-encoded CDs.<br>HDCD has two major characteristics, peak extension and low-level extension. Peak extension prevents sound distortion level extension, which boosts low-level signals for recording and improves S/N as a kind of noise reduction.<br><br>It complies with the THX ultra standard and meets the Lucasfilm DVD player requirements for video and audio quality and operability for connection.<br>For video, there are requirements for quality in terms of 60 factors that determine the video S/N, as well as the accuracy of reproduction of luminance and color-difference signals. For audio, there are requirements for quality in terms of 30 factors such as S/N, frequency characteristics, and distortion factor. In terms of operation, there are requirements for quality in terms of 20 items. DVD 5000 satisfies all of these requirements.<br><br>Equipped with digital input terminals (one optical and one coaxial system), it can also be used as a DAC unit with AL24 Processor and D/A converter.<br>Since the digital output signal can be linked with the Source switch, it can also be used as a digital selector.<br><br>It supports DTS bit stream output, and you can enjoy DTS5.1 ch surround by connecting a commercially available DTS decoder and AV amplifier.<br><br>The video circuit is equipped with a high-speed, high-precision 10-bit / 27-MHz video DAC and high-precision video decoder.<br><br>Equipped with color difference (component) video output, Y signal, Cb (Pb) signal and Cr (Pr) signal recorded on DVD can be directly D/A converted and output.<br><br>A self-oscillating red laser pickup with a wavelength of 650 nm is used in the pickup section.<br>In addition, the pickup lens has a hologram that is integrally molded so that one pickup can handle DVDs and music CDs with different focal lengths, and reliability is enhanced by its simple structure.<br>The servo system employs a digital servo system to ensure optimal servo control for various variable factors caused by disk and digital processing.<br><br>The internal structure adopts a center mechanical layout system with a low center of gravity. The drive part, which is a source of vibration, is located in the lower center and is firmly fixed to the high-rigidity copper-plated chassis with a FIX mechanical bracket.<br>In addition, a copper plate is installed in the rear of the tray to ensure stability of the rotating system and to suppress unnecessary vibration. In addition, the mechanical part and digital, video and audio parts are separated by copper plated steel plates to eliminate interference and vibration between circuits.<br><br>High rigidity is ensured by 15 mm thick aluminum front panel, double top cover and four bottom cover.<br>In addition, a sintered alloy insulator with vibration absorbing material is used to eliminate the effect of external and internal vibrations on sound and image quality.<br><br>The power supply uses a 3-transformer system that separates audio, digital, and control power.<br>We also use special transformers filled with anti-vibration material for both audio and digital transformers.<br><br>In addition to the detachable OFC extra-thick AC cord, high-sound electrolytic capacitor, high-sound film capacitor, high-sound carbon resistance, and selective operational amplifier for sound quality, we use parts that have been selected in the development of the S series.<br><br>All audio and video jacks and S terminal are gold-plated.<br>The voice FIX terminal uses a large separate type.<br><br>It is equipped with a GUI function for various settings, and you can set the operation status, various settings and disc information during playback on the monitor screen.<br><br>Self-illuminated remote controller is included.</p>
