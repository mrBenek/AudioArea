				<p class="detail">This MD deck is a prestige model of the ES series, which employs a newly developed TYPE-R DSP for ATRAC and a new DAC system.<br><br>In addition to the ATRAC DSP, we have newly developed and adopted the TYPE-R DSP for ATRAC, which has twice the signal processing capability of the conventional DSP. In addition, by adopting the newly developed Intelligent Bit Relocation Algorithm, we maximize the increased processing capability and reanalyze the spectrum converted data. This enables us to search for minute levels of redundant bit allocation that have been difficult to detect until now the frequency bands that are important for listening. This further refines the bit allocation and brings it closer to the waveform of the original music source.<br>Discs recorded with TYPE-R DSPs for ATRAC can be played on MD decks that do not use TYPE-R DSPs.<br><br>Wide bit stream technology using TYPE-R DSP for ATRAC has been introduced.<br>With 24-bit input / output and extended operation word length, recording and playback with a wide dynamic range of 20-bit accuracy exceeding the 16-bit MD format is possible.<br><br>The DAC section uses a new DAC system that uses S-TACT IC.<br>S-TACT reads input digital data and generates high-precision pulse signals. In addition, by completely separating the pulse generator from digital arithmetic units such as digital filters and noise shapers, S-TACT has the advantage of eliminating the influence of digital noise on the time axis of pulses.<br>The MDS-JA555ES uses a newly developed S-TACT IC that improves the clock accuracy of the S-TACT to 128 fs. It can draw out the capability of the 24-bit (V. C.) digital filter used in the digital calculation part of the previous stage, and it expands the dynamic range and improves the S/N ratio.<br><br>The D/A converter of the DAC system uses a current pulse D/A converter that is used in Sony&#39;s Super Audio CD players and ES series CD players. The current pulse output as voltage is replaced with a current that is less affected by voltage-induced noise and transmitted. It has a stable current source and is not affected by voltage fluctuations, making it possible to achieve excellent low-frequency playback.<br><br>It is equipped with a sampling rate converter that automatically converts 32 kHz and 48 kHz sampling frequency to 44.1 kHz.<br><br>The power supply section uses an R-core transformer with no gaps in the core of the transformer and a circular doughnut type in cross section to greatly reduce magnetic flux leakage and vibration.<br>In addition, the MDS-JA555ES is equipped with one R-core transformer for audio and one R-core transformer for digital signal, thereby realizing a power supply with less interference and fluctuation.<br><br>The chassis structure is made of a metal material with sufficient strength. The FB chassis is firmly fixed as a single box with a frame surrounding the outer circumference and beams passed in front and back. By combining members of different shapes and sizes, natural vibration is mutually cancelled, and vibration of the chassis as a whole is greatly reduced.<br>In addition, the chassis is further reinforced by passing oblique beams to the front and side surfaces of the frame, and vibration resistant members such as two 2-mm bottom plates are used to greatly reduce vibration of the chassis as a whole.<br><br>A low center of gravity center and a ray loading system are used to load the disk.<br>The tray loading section and base unit section are floating with insulators and compression coil blades. The mold holding the base unit section is made of a material with excellent vibration damping characteristics called PBT. This reduces vibration to the disk and improves signal reading accuracy.<br><br>It uses an eccentric insulator whose mounting hole to the chassis is offset from the center. As a result, vibrations transmitted from the outside cancel each other, making it difficult for them to be transmitted to the chassis. In particular, it is effective in damping vibration components in the middle and high frequency range, which affect audibility.<br><br>Equipped with digital REC level control, the gain can be controlled from - ∞ dB to + 18 dB at the center of gain 0 dB.<br>It also has a built-in memory function that can store the set recording level for each input channel.<br><br>It is equipped with a variable (V. C. = Variable Coefficient) digital filter which can obtain a subtle change of sound by changing the cut-off characteristic of the digital filter when playing back the MD. The MDS-JA40ES has increased the calculation speed as well as the calculation word length to 24 bits. In addition, the processing performance has been greatly improved by the adoption of S-TACT IC for 128 fs. 555<br>There are four preset positions for the variable digital filter, and you can adjust the sound quality according to your preference.<br><br>It is equipped with Route 3 digital input corresponding to 24 bit and two digital outputs.<br><br>Equipped with 2-line display FL display.<br><br>It is equipped with a smart space function that automatically adjusts the non-recording portion of digital recording to approximately 3 seconds.<br><br>Equipped with a timer standby function.<br><br>Equipped with a Control A1II connector that can be used with Sony CD players.<br><br>Equipped with a pitch control function, the playback speed can be changed from -98.5% to + 12.5%.<br><br>It is equipped with a music sync function. Simply by pressing the music sync button on the remote control and then starting performance on the connected device, it senses the input of a music signal and automatically starts recording.<br><br>It is equipped with a time machine recording function, and if you press the multi-jog dial in the recording pause state, you can record up to 6 seconds before the sound on the disc.<br><br>It is equipped with a monaural recording and playback function that allows you to use the MD twice as long as the display.<br><br>You can DIVIDE, COMBINE, and MOVE songs, and it also has an UNDO function to cancel the last edit operation if you make a mistake.<br><br>It is equipped with a rehearse function that allows you to check edit points in COORDINATE or DIVIDE.<br>To move edit points, you can fine-tune the DIVIDE edit point in minutes, seconds, or frames (approximately 0.01 seconds).<br><br>Equipped with an A-B ERASE function that allows you to erase between two specified points in a song.<br><br>It is equipped with a title function that can record up to 1,700 characters of disc names and song titles on the disc.<br>In addition to alphabets, numbers and symbols, katakana characters are also supported. You can input characters from the FOMA phone or remote controller during recording or playback.<br><br>It is compatible with MD-PC Link and can be connected to a PC by MD-PC Link Kit (sold separately).<br>This allows you to perform various disc editing operations from your PC, including basic operations on the MD deck, on the PC screen. You can also feel and enter hiragana characters from your PC keyboard (only on display-compatible models).<br>In addition, you can enjoy creating MD labels and recording from PCCD to MD.<br><br>The SCMS (Serial Copy Management System) allows digital recording only for one generation and does not allow digital recording for the second or later generations. However, some programs from CS broadcasting cannot be recorded.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
