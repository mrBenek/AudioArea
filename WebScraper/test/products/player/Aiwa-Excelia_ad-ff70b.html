				<p class="detail">Stereo cassette deck equipped with computer brain function and Dolby HX Pro.<br><br>Equipped with the Dolby HX Pro, which controls the recording bias current according to the movement of the music signal during recording.<br>In the Dolby HX Pro, the effective bias value, which corresponds to the total of the music signal and bias current applied to the recording head, is always controlled to an appropriate value to prevent the high-frequency MOL degradation caused by the high-frequency component of the music signal acting in the same way as the bias current.<br>This circuit operates only during recording, so it is compatible with any deck.<br><br>It is equipped with a Computer Brain that automatically selects the optimum bias value, recording sensitivity and equalizer value for the tape. If this circuit is activated before recording starts, it automatically searches for the optimum value for the tape from 30000 combinations in about 16 seconds.<br>In addition, it is equipped with a 3-position data memory mechanism that can store set values by tape type.<br><br>DX Combination 3 head has been adopted for the head.<br>By adopting the 3-head method, it is possible to set the gap width and characteristics suitable for each head, and simultaneous monitoring during recording is possible. In addition, the DX Combination Head adopts a special structure that uses Sendust for the guard part and a hard composite material for the core spacer to improve abrasion resistance.<br><br>The mechanism part uses a super-stabilized torsion dual capstan system.<br>In this system, a capstan with a special surface treatment using Aiwa&#39;s unique micrograin processing is used on the take-up side. This reduces slippage between the capstan and the tape, and insulates from torque fluctuations and vibration of the take-up reel shaft, as well as effects from other drive systems. This ensures stable running with constant tension and head touch.<br><br>Equipped with multi-functional electronic counter with tape time display.<br>This counter provides a real-time digital display of the remaining tape time in minutes / seconds by indicating the number of minutes of tape when the tape is attached.<br>When used as a digital counter, the memory repeat mechanism allows repeated playback between any two points.<br><br>It is equipped with an intro play mechanism that automatically plays the beginning of a song for about 8 seconds and fast-forwards it one after another.<br><br>Equipped with an auto tape selector that automatically determines the tape type just by setting it.<br><br>Equipped with automatic demagnetization system ADMS (Automatic Demagnetization System).<br>In ADMS, each time the power switch is turned ON, a degaussing oscillator in the deck passes a high-frequency current to the head, completing the degaussing in 1.5 seconds. This prevents the head from being magnetized, solving problems such as high and low band noise levels, high band losses during playback, and high band erasure of tapes.<br><br>Equipped with 12-point LED meter with peak hold.<br><br>Equipped with Double Dolby B/C.<br><br>It has a playback volume.<br><br>Auto Rec Mute is installed.<br><br>Equipped with MPX filter.<br><br>Equipped with a microphone terminal and remote control terminal.</p>
