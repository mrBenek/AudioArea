				<p class="detail">A cassette deck with thorough attention paid to the three points of head, amplifier and driving system.<br><br>A 3-head configuration is adopted in which PCOCC (single-crystal-like high-purity oxygen-free copper), which is basically made of a single oxygen-free copper crystal, is used for the head winding for one cable.<br>This improves signal transmission efficiency and achieves excellent recording / re-quality from small signals to large signals. Recording from digital sources is also supported.<br>The head block is mounted on a highly rigid zinc die-cast base to maintain the optimum position for tape running, and the recording / reproducing head is subjected to a strict characteristic check to ensure high accuracy.<br><br>The power supply section is equipped with a super-linear power supply that achieves a low impedance of 1/10 that of the conventional power supply. To eliminate interference between each block, a 3-block independent power supply system is used that supplies power to the amplifier system, FL display system, and drive system via dedicated lines. In addition, a SBD (ultra-fast rectifier diode) is used for the rectifier circuit of the read / write amplifier system power supply to reduce pulse-like noise. In addition, the generation of ripple component is suppressed to less than 1/10 by ± 2 power supply configuration with a 3-terminal regulator.<br>As a result, high-speed and low-impedance power supply are achieved, and characteristics such as dynamic range and detail reproducibility are improved.<br><br>A special buffer amplifier has been developed for the recording amplifier section to further reduce the impedance of the entire recording system and improve the separation. At the same time, the noise from the motor and display system is cut off to realize clear recording.<br><br>An isolated base with insulation effect is adopted for the mounting part of the power transformer.<br>Interference of leakage flux between the power transformer and chassis is suppressed, and slight distortion in the middle and high range caused by electromagnetic effects is eliminated.<br><br>A silent mechanism with dedicated motors for the capstan drive, reel drive, and mechanical drive. A low-ripple, high-torque motor, a large-diameter flywheel for total balance control, and a capstan shaft with smooth surface treatment are adopted.<br><br>The Dolby HX-PRO is installed to further improve the high-frequency recording characteristics.<br>In the case of a source with many high-frequency components, the bias current was excessive and the high-frequency level decreased. However, this phenomenon is automatically controlled in response to changes in the music signal.<br>As a result, flat frequency characteristics up to the high end and large dynamic range are obtained.<br><br>Equipped with a real-time counter that digitally displays minutes and seconds of elapsed time and remaining time of the tape, whether from the middle of the tape or during fast forward / rewind.<br>It is an original type that detects from the rotational speed of both supply and take reels, and accuracy is improved by the recalque function that recalculates at the remaining 6 minutes.<br>Tape sizes are available in six sizes : C-46/54/60/80/90/120 C-46 and C-46L are automatically determined by computer.<br><br>In order to bring out the characteristics of each tape slightly different, it is equipped with an accubias control that can perform severe bias adjustment.<br><br>Equipped with Dolby Type B and Type C noise reduction system to reduce tape hissing.<br><br>Uses a large insulator equipped with a cork plate that effectively absorbs external vibration.<br><br>Uses a power cord with polarity display.<br><br>Equipped with an auto monitor system that automatically switches between tape monitor and source monitor, 2-mode repeat function of full repeat / block repeat, 16-segment level indicator with peak hold, timer standby function, MPX filter switch, automatic tape slack removal function, etc.</p>
