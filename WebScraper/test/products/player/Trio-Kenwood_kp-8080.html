				<p class="detail">Electronic full auto turntable with inertial lock system and computer control mechanism.<br><br>The low frequency rotating load is locked with quartz, and at the same time, it is locked with inertia by rotating the super heavy turntable, and transient uneven rotation is suppressed.<br><br>A non-contact optical detection mechanism combining LED and phototransistor is used for arm motion detection. Even when the Oatley turn position is detected, the auto mechanism does not contact the tone arm, preventing harmful vibrations generated by the auto mechanism from being transmitted to the needle tip.<br>The operation mechanism is equipped with a dedicated DC microphone low motor for driving the tone arm and a dedicated plunger for arm elevation.<br>By providing a dedicated drive source for each operation, reliable and smooth automatic operation is possible.<br><br>Equipped with an automatic disc size selector, when a played disc is placed on a turntable, the optical detection mechanism automatically reads the disc size as 30 cm, 25 cm and 17 cm, and guides the needle tip to the first sound groove of the disc.<br>If the disc is a 33 rpm disc, it will be set with priority at the same time as Power On and play will start just by pressing the Play switch.<br>Even if the Play switch is pressed by mistake without putting the disk on, the needle tip does not go down to the turntable and returns to the arm rest with the needle up.<br><br>Equipped with a tone arm free selection function that allows the needle tip to be lowered to any position on the disc.<br>The needle tip can be moved up and down without touching the tone arm at all, so that even people who are not used to handling the player do not damage the needle tip by mistake.<br>Even when the disc is playing or the arm is in the rest position, if you press the free selection switch in the direction of the arrow, the tone arm will automatically move up and start moving in the specified direction. You can also press the FAST switch to move the arm 3.5 times faster.<br>When you have reached the desired position on the disc, use the Up / Down switch to lower the needle point and play the desired song.<br><br>Equipped with the height adjustment mechanism of the tone arm. When the lock lever fixed to the wedge chuck is pulled, the tone arm is raised automatically by the up spring.<br>In addition, a long tone arm with an effective length of 245 mm is adopted, and cartridges from all over the world can be used.<br>We prevent transmission loss by using a silk-wrapped Pentlitz wire as an extension wire (for which PAT application was pending at the time) and a 2-core shielded wire as an output cord (for which PAT application was pending at the time).<br><br>It can also be used as a normal manual player.<br>When the tone arm is removed from the rest, the turntable automatically starts rotating, the needle point is set, and the arm returns to the rest by the auto return operation when the performance is finished.<br>In addition, because it is an electronic full-auto system, unlike conventional mechanical full-auto systems, even when playing a disc in full-auto play or when the tone arm is moving in lead-in, all automatic operations are canceled by returning the arm to the rest by hand, and the next manual operation can be immediately started.<br><br>Uses Trio&#39;s original PLL reversible DC servo motor.<br>The servo detection section uses a 180 slot mechanical integration method, and the detection signal is S-V (Speed-Volt) converted as it is. In addition, the reversible DC servo that controls the rotation in both positive and negative directions increases the response to transient load fluctuations.<br>The Center shaft is made of hard stainless steel with a diameter of 10 φ. 550 kg ・ cm for the turntable while suppressing the eccentricity of the turntable.<sup>2</sup>Moment of inertia, and the transient load variation is locked by moment of inertia.<br><br>The cabinet uses a composite structure cabinet made of hard homogen and ARCB (resin concrete as the main material with natural stone added for excellent anti-vibration effect).<br>In addition, the complex cabinet is sandwiched and fixed by 90 mm diameter 6 mm thick aluminum die cast arm base and mechanism chassis, and the operation of the tone arm and cartridge is protected from disturbance with all frequency components and moment.<br><br>The cartridge was not included.</p>
