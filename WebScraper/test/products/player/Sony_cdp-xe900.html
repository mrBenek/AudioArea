				<p class="detail">CD player with fixed optical system mechanism.<br><br>An optical system fixing mechanism has been adopted for the mechanism, and the optical pickup is fixed to the strong base part and the disk side is moved. This greatly reduces vibration of the pickup, and the current required for servo is limited to relatively slow movement to compensate for distortion and eccentricity of the disk, and the fluctuation of servo current is reduced.<br>The disc is designed to be attached to the turntable using a built-in chucking mechanism.<br><br>The digital filter is a full feed-forward type digital filter.<br>This digital filter uses a 3-stage connection method with a double-type digital filter. First, complementary data is generated at the midpoint between the data obtained from the disk and the data, and the resulting data is used to create the next complementary data. In the conventional digital filter, only the high-order bits are used by rounding the low-order bits of the calculation result obtained here. However, this rounding error causes requantization noise.<br>The full-feed-forward digital filter realizes an oversampling operation that also reflects low-bit data by performing a full-feed forward (FF) operation that combines the low-bit data with the result of the next stage operation. This eliminates almost all requantization noise in the audible band, greatly improving the quality of low-level signals.<br><br>A current pulse D/A converter is used for the D/A converter.<br>In this method, a stable and clean current source is prepared, and the current pulse is generated by switching using the output of the pulse generator. This eliminates the influence of voltage fluctuations and the influence of voltage noise in the arithmetic circuit, which are problems with conventional pulse D/A converters that use voltage.<br>It also employs a complimentary service PLM that differentially synthesizes the output of the pulse D/A converter to reduce harmonic distortion.<br><br>By placing the master clock section close to the D/A converter, more accurate processing is possible. In addition, by supplying a pure clock to the peripheral digital calculation section via a direct digital sink, the total capacity of the D/A conversion section is enhanced.<br><br>The servo circuit uses a high-precision digital servo, and by adjusting the servo amount of the optical pickup for each disc being played, servocontrol that more accurately reflects the disc condition is possible.<br><br>A center mechanical mounting system has been adopted for the internal layout, and the mechanical deck, which is the only mechanical operation section, is placed in the center of the chassis to minimize the rotational moment applied to the chassis and improve the stability against vibration.<br><br>An eccentric insulator is used for the legs.<br>This insulator is designed with the mounting hole offset from the center, and vibration propagation to the chassis is reduced by mutually canceling external vibration. The position and diameter of the hole are determined through repeated trial production and trial listening. This is particularly effective in attenuating mid - and high-frequency vibration components that affect audibility.<br><br>The AMS is a rotary music selection method using a jog dial to pick up a few songs before or after, enabling speedy music selection utilizing the sense of the fingertips.<br><br>It has a custom edit function and features such as peak search, time edit, just edit, program edit, time fade, manual fader and variable fade.<br><br>It is equipped with functions such as 99 Delete Play, 99 Shuffle Play, Music Scan, Auto Space and 7 mode repeat.<br><br>A plated pin jack is used for the output terminal.<br><br>Equipped with an optical digital output.<br><br>Equipped with a headphone output terminal with volume.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
