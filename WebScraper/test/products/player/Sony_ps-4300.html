				<p class="detail">A full-automatic player with the same configuration as the PS 3750 and a full-automatic mechanism.<br><br>Equipped with a full-automatic mechanism, the tone arm automatically leads in and starts tracing by simply setting it to the size of the record you want to listen to and pressing the electronic touch switch. After playing the record, when the needle tip is led out into the silent groove, a return mechanism based on the Luminous sensor activates and returns to the armrest.<br>In addition, auto-cut and repeat operation are also possible.<br><br>In the Luminous sensor (contactless photoelectric element detection) system return mechanism, when the needle tip moves from the final sound groove of the record board to the lead-out groove, the shutter moves in conjunction with the rotating shaft of the arm. With this photocoupler system, the photoelectric element detects the amount of light and generates a signal. The signal activates the linear motion plunger and generates power from the center gear inserted in the brush and slotless motor to return the tone arm.<br>By adopting this Luminous sensor system full automatic mechanism, the side pressure applied to the needle tip at the time of return detection, which could not be removed with the mechanical system, can be reduced to 0, so that light needle pressure and racing are also possible.<br><br>The fully automatic mechanism is designed for ease of use and safety.<br>When the tone arm is stopped by hand during auto lead-in or Oatley turn operation or when the size selector is switched, excessive force is applied to the mechanism or the tone arm and it is likely to cause failure. However, the safe auto mechanism is realized by the adoption of the arm limiter mechanism.<br>In addition, the response operation of the tone arm is improved by a quick action mechanism in which an electronic circuit is activated by an electronic touch Icchy, a linear motion plunger is immediately activated, a trigger lever is activated and an auto operation is started.<br>In addition, operation instructions from the touch switch are stored in an FF (flip-flop) memory circuit, and along with signals to inform the operation status of the auto mechanism, the logic judgment circuit judges it to control auto climate.<br>In manual operation, auto queuing is available.<br><br>An LED display is used to indicate the operation status of the tone arm and repeat performance, and the start / stop / repeat operation is a front control system that can be operated even with the dust cover closed.<br><br>In order to reduce torque unevenness caused by cogging (changes in magnetic attraction force and mechanical torque) that occurs in DC motors, we have adopted a brush-and-slotless motor with a structure that does not have slots in principle.<br>This motor consists of a concentric circular solid core, a trapezoidal wave magnetized magnet ring, and a saturable inductor. Since the rotational force generated by the motor is proportional to the amount of magnetic flux passing through the coil and the amount of current flowing, if the amount of current is constant, the rotational force is proportional to the amount of magnetic flux. Therefore, the amount of magnetic flux must be uniform in order to suppress torque unevenness during rotation.<br>The slotless motor uses a trapezoidal wave magnetizing method for the magnet ring to obtain uniform magnetic flux density.<br>In addition, in order to detect the relative positional relationship between the stator coil and rotor magnetic pole, a magnetic window is provided in the magnet ring, and an electronic control system that senses magnetism with a saturable inductor is adopted. Stable rotational force is obtained by effectively using a constant magnetic flux.<br><br>In order to obtain more accurate rotational speed, a unique magne-disk servo system is adopted for the servo circuit.<br>This system is a high-precision speed control function that introduced Sony Magne-scale precision measuring equipment technology that measures things in the micron unit or less. The outer circumference of the turntable that can be taken in a wide range is coated with barium ferrite with high coercive force. Around this circumference, 512 speed detection signal is magnetized with high density. The signal is detected at an average value with an 8-tooth double-gap head, and high-precision and stable servo detection is realized.<br>In addition, since the generated signal frequency is as high as approximately 284 Hz at 33 1/3rpm, the servo compensation frequency band can be widened, and the slight delay and advance during rotation can be accurately captured, and quick response characteristics can be obtained.<br><br>The cabinet uses SBMC, an acoustic material with high internal loss and low resonance.<br>In order to take full advantage of the features of SBMC, thickness and structure were comprehensively examined, and resonance parts were eliminated by integral molding with reinforcement at important points to realize a frame structure resistant to resonance.<br>In addition, a large, height-adjustable insulator is integrated with the cabinet and attached to lower the center of gravity to increase the stability of the cabinet.<br><br>Uses XL-15, which is a MM type cartridge.<br>The XL-15 is composed of a conical damper that suppresses unnecessary vibration caused by friction between the sound groove of the record board and the needle tip, a resin containing carbon fiber in the pole piece block, and a magnetic circuit with excellent left and right balance.<br><br>The tone arm uses a high-sensitivity static balance type, and the bearing uses a precision pivot bearing to increase the sensitivity. In addition, each joint including the pivot is supported by a damper to provide anti-vibration design.<br>The head shell is made of aluminum light alloy and is lightweight, highly rigid and non-resonant.<br>And, it is equipped with inside for scan seller and lateral balancer.<br><br>A stroboscopic illumination prism is mounted on the peripheral strobe, making it easy to see the stroboscopic pattern.<br><br>33 equipped with independent pitch control for 2 speeds of 33 1/3 and 45 rpm.<br><br>An oil dump type arm lifter is adopted.<br><br>Uses a rotatable arm rest for easy needle pressure adjustment.<br><br>Uses a low-capacity phono cord.<br><br>Equipped with 2 replacement shell stands.<br><br>Comes with a removable acrylic dust cover.</p>
