				<p class="detail">Turntable equipped with vacuum disk stabilizer.<br><br></p>
            <hr>
			<p class="detail"><strong>Vacuum disk stabilizer</strong><br><br>It employs a vacuum disk stabilizer that adsorbs and integrates the phonograph record onto the turntable, and completely eliminates harmful resonance caused by the material and warpage of the phonograph record.<br>In order to realize an adsorption system, PD300 uses a vacuum pump. This vacuum pump is simple, applying the principle of bellows, and is the driving force for reliable adsorption operation. In addition, two grooves and an inlet are provided on the turntable surface as an air suction path, and an air passage is provided inside the turntable, which is connected to the pump by a tube.<br>When the pressure applied to the sound groove portion by this absorption system is converted into gravity, it is equivalent to mounting a stabilizer of approximately 50 kg, and an excellent stabilizer effect can be obtained.<br><br>Suction and release operations are performed by operating the suction lever installed on the front of the cabinet. The suction operation is performed when the normal position is horizontal and vertical. At this time, when the specified suction condition is achieved, the indicator beside the suction lever changes from light to blue. This indicator detects the vacuum between the record and the turntable and operates.<br><br>The vacuum disk stabilizer was originally inspired by the suction system of the cutting machine.<br>Since the cutting machine system is designed to maintain the suction state by continuously sucking air, it is accompanied by noise and vibration, and there is a problem when it is introduced directly into the player. Therefore, in order to maintain the sealing degree of the suction state, the PD300 is equipped with a sealing pad on the turntable surface. This pad is installed on the outer and inner sides of the sound groove of the LP record. When the sound groove portion adheres to the turntable, it flexibly adheres to the record and creates a sealed state. This allows the specified suction state to be maintained for a long time even if the suction operation is stopped once the suction is applied.<br>This sealing pad has been selected to be stable over time and is designed to be compatible as a service part.<br><br></p>

			<p class="detail"><strong>Turntable part</strong><br><br>A belt drive system is adopted for the turntable drive part, and the effect of vibration and flux is eliminated by moving the motor away from the trajectory of the cartridge.<br>The motor uses a brush and slot-less DC servo motor that reduces vibration by operating at a low speed of 10 x rotation speed. In addition, an aluminum die-cast turntable with a weight of 3.5 kg is mounted to obtain a strong inertial mass. This realizes quiet and smooth record rotation using inertial energy, which is essentially different from servo systems such as direct drives.<br><br>The bearing part that supports the turntable is made of solid material and structure. The shaft is made of stainless steel and has a diameter of 10 mm. It is received by a bearing ball made of cemented carbide. Moreover, it is firmly supported by a large bearing made of brass and fixed to the chassis with a large nut of 36 mm φ.<br><br></p>
            <hr>
			<p class="detail"><strong>Cabinet part</strong><br><br>In the PD300, the bearing and the arm base mounting part are integrated as the main chassis and are rigidly molded with aluminum die-cast. The heavy weight arm base is also firmly integrated with 6 bolts.<br>This integrated structure eliminates the source of unnecessary vibration from the room of the reproduction system of the phonograph record, turntable and tone arm together with the effect of the absorption system.<br><br>As a countermeasure against external vibration, we have adopted a cabinet with sufficient durability and weight. In addition, three main insulators are installed between the cabinet and the main chassis, and a large sub insulator is installed in the legs of the cabinet for double insulation system.<br>This double insulator eliminates the influence of external vibration.<br><br>The main insulator is installed in the main chassis, and the integrated regenerative system is suspended from the cabinet and dumped at the same time.<br>This insulator adopts LUX&#39;s unique 2-stage braking system to block external vibration regardless of amplitude. In this system, the shaft is first supported by special rubber to cut small vibration by internal loss, and in addition, large amplitude vibration is blocked by a combination of viscous braking of silicon grease and spring.<br>The horizontal balance of the turntable can be adjusted with this insulator.<br><br>Sub-insulators are installed on the legs of the four corners of the cabinet.<br>This insulator is used to support the player as a whole and to dump it from the stage. It is made of large natural high quality rubber.<br>Sub-insulators allow you to adjust the horizontal balance of the entire player.<br><br></p>
            <hr>
			<p class="detail"><strong>Other</strong><br><br>Equipped with a turntable rotation fine adjustment mechanism, it can adjust both 33 rpm and 45 rpm independently with a strobe installed in front of the turntable. This strobe displays the pattern engraved on the back of the turntable with flashing light from the built-in quartz oscillator, making extremely accurate adjustment possible.<br>The adjustment knob is provided at the bottom of the cabinet.<br><br>Equipped with an overhang adjustment mechanism.<br>The PD300 is designed to allow easy adjustment of the overhang when the arm base is mounted. When the arm base is mounted, the main chassis is held between the arm base and the mounting bracket and fixed with bolts. However, since the arm mounting hole of the arm base is located at an off-center position, the overhang can be adjusted by rotating the arm base. In addition, since the hole of the main chassis through which the bolt is passed has a shape with allowance, the appropriate overhang can be obtained by fine adjustment.<br><br>The arm base is detachable so that the tone arm can be easily replaced. This arm base is 8 mm thick aluminum machined heavy weight, and it is fixed firmly with 6 bolts.<br>Four types of arm bases were prepared depending on the shape of the arm mounting hole.<br><br>Equipped with line phase sensor, polarity of PD300 can be checked.</p>
