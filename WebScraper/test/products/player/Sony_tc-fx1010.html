				<p class="detail">The cassette deck is the top-of-the-line model of the digital deck that integrates microcomputer technology.<br><br>It is equipped with ASP (Audio Signal Processor) which is a newly developed IC by Sony.<br>In place of the mechanical parts such as variable resistors and switches used in the signal control system of the tape deck, this IC includes signal control functions such as purely electronic digital volume and electronic switches, and achieves high performance by realizing low distortion rate and high SN ratio.<br>By combining this IC with a microcomputer, all switches can be feather-touch and remotely controlled, and various functions can be automatically adjusted according to the tape characteristics.<br>Moreover, by adding an external non-volatile memory, it is possible to combine and store multiple pieces of information.<br><br>It uses a closed-loop dual capstan system that uses two sets of capstan and pinch rollers to firmly osae komi the tape and prevents vibration of the tape near the head. This realizes uniform head touch and stable tape travel.<br>We have also improved the rotational characteristics by adopting a two motor system in which a BSL green motor for driving the capstan and a DC motor for driving the reel are independent.<br><br>By connecting the playhead directly to the playback amplifier, the coupling capacitor prevents sound quality degradation.<br>It also employs a DC amplifier configuration to improve low-frequency phase characteristics and a ± 2 power supply system.<br><br>Sony&#39;s independently suspended S &amp; F head combines the advantages of an independent head that allows precise azimuth adjustment with the advantages of a combination head that provides uniform head touch.<br>In addition, a magne-focus 4-Gap F &amp; F erasing head is used for the erasing head.<br><br>When the self-monitoring function is installed and the difference between the source signal and the playback signal is large during recording, an error message is displayed on the fluorescent indicator to detect extreme changes in sound quality or level down caused by excessive input.<br><br>If you touch any of the keys in the center, such as the normally used eject key, memo Leaky key, or tape drive key, the power is automatically turned on, and after about 4 seconds of standby, the operation moves directly to operation.<br>In addition, it is equipped with a function that automatically turns off the power when stopped for about 60 minutes.<br><br>Equipped with a linear electronic counter that digitally displays the running time of the tape in minutes and seconds.<br>In TC-FX1010, a subtraction function is newly installed, and negative counting is possible.<br><br>It is equipped with a status memory function which can preset four kinds of recording and re-recording states.<br>A total of 10 items can be set for the memory contents : the optimum recording bias and recording sensitivity set in auto calibration, on/off of AUTO ATT, tape type, recording level, recording level L/R balance, line / headphone output level, Dolby NR position, on/off of MPX filter, MOL balance, on/off of BEEP sound during operation.<br><br>Equipped with multi-display fluorescent tube display multi-function peak program meter.<br>It can multi-display the optimum recording level for each tape type, and uses a double indication system that simultaneously displays peak hold and real-time peak values.<br><br>As a noise reduction system, Dolby C type is installed in addition to Dolby B type.<br><br>Equipped with an auto tape selector that automatically selects the tape position.<br>When a tape is loaded, the position of the tape is automatically selected, and the appropriate bias and equalizer are selected. The type of tape selected is indicated by the Tape indicator.<br><br>It is equipped with a BEEP switch which can confirm operation by electronic sound.<br><br>Equipped with a MOL balance control function, you can set the bias amount at 3 points during recording, and choose SOFT/NORM/SHARP according to the music source. For sources with a large amount of low-frequency energy, you can use the SOFT position, which allows a large amount of low-frequency MOL. For sources with a large amount of high-frequency components such as jazz cymbals, you can use the SHARP position, which extends the high-frequency characteristics, so you can adjust the flavor according to your preference.<br>In addition, the frequency variation is compensated by the equalizer, so that a flat frequency response can be obtained at any position.<br><br>Equipped with an auto-calibration function that automatically adjusts recording bias and recording sensitivity in approximately 8 seconds.<br><br>Equipped with an auto-attenuator function that automatically adjusts the recording level if there is an unexpected over-input during recording.<br>When AUTO ATT is ON, a self-monitor 3-head system is used to compare the mid-low and high-frequency MOL values set for the type of tape being used with the mid-low and high-frequency levels of the recorded signal. If the set attenuator value is too high, the attenuator is automatically adjusted to the optimum value.<br><br>There were wireless remote control, wired remote control and foot remote control sold separately.<br>In addition, by using RM-65 (sold separately), it is possible to play in sync with Sony&#39;s player with remote control terminal and TC-PB5 play-only deck.</p>
