				<p class="detail">ES series CD player equipped with newly developed pulse 8D/A converter and designed for high sound quality.<br><br>The D/A converter consists of a high-density linear converter system, a 45-bit noise-shaping digital filter and a pulse D/A converter.<br><br>The Pulse D/A converter consists of a current source and an electronic switch. It expresses music waveform by switching two values of 0 and 1 at high speed. By this, the amplitude level is always constant and changes only in the time axis direction. The PLM (Pulse Length Modulation) wave is output. By passing it through a low-pass filter, unwanted high-frequency noise outside the audio band is removed and music waveform is obtained.<br>To reduce quantization noise in the audible band up to 20 kHz, the pulse D/A converter is equipped with a multi-stage noise shaping operation that employs 64 times oversampling and the Sony Extended Noise Shaping method. Oversampling reduces quantization noise in the audible band by increasing the sampling frequency. Noise shaping reduces quantization noise in the audible band by feeding back the requantization error to the input side when the number of bits is reduced. These technologies ensure a high dynamic range.<br>The pulse D/A converter operates at 45 mega pulses per second, and it completely eliminates differential non-linear distortion, glitch, and 0 cross distortion, which were difficult with conventional methods.<br><br>The newly developed pulse D/A converter has a 4D/A output that outputs positive-phase, negative-phase, and each LR signal.<br>The ES Series is equipped with two pulse D/A converters in the complimentary service mode, in which two pulse D/A converters are used to produce 8D/A outputs. In the complimentary service mode, two pulse D/A converters are modulated and differentially synthesized so that they are complementary to each other. This mode has the effect of canceling harmonic distortion and improves the distortion factor. In addition, the SN ratio is improved by doubling the output current value.<br><br>To take advantage of the pulse D/A converter, the high-density linear converter system is equipped with a 45-bit noise-shaping digital filter in the front stage.<br>This circuit achieves a high dynamic range by performing a highly accurate oversampling operation and a first order noise-shaping operation on the operation result.<br><br>A direct digital sink is included to eliminate jittering issues.<br>In this system, the master clock is formed on the same chip as the pulse D/A converter, and jitter is eliminated in principle by eliminating jitter immediately before the electronic switch, which is the final stage of the pulse D/A converter.<br><br>The analog low-pass filter employs a GIC-type low-pass filter in which passive elements such as capacitors and coils do not enter in series.<br><br>Low noise and high stability are achieved by incorporating an RF amplifier in the pickup section.<br><br>The digital signal processing LSI uses the fourth generation LSI for the Sony CD player. Previously external RAM has been upgraded to a capacity of 32 kbit and built into the digital signal processing LSI. The precision of the signal processing capability is further enhanced by adopting the strict 6-fold error correction method.<br><br>The drive circuit of the optical pickup uses a newly designed fine drive.<br>This circuit uses a balanced push-pull drive circuit with ± 2 power supply system instead of a single-drive circuit with one side ground in the past. This circuit is separated from the earth by using a balanced push-pull drive circuit with ± 2 power supply system. This eliminates noise current from entering the power supply line and realizes a cleaner optical pickup drive.<br><br>The servo circuit is equipped with the S Servo III, which works on out-of-band noise, and the Advanced TS Servo, which works within the servo band.<br>In the S Servo III, the high-frequency noise component of the servo current is removed with a low-pass filter to supply a smooth servo current, which stabilizes the power supply from the power supply and prevents adverse effects on sound quality.<br>The Advanced TS Servo reduces the current that is unnecessary for servo operation by nearly 10 dB. In addition, the actuator of the optical pickup is equipped with a newly developed optical pickup to further improve the quietness of the optical system.<br><br>A digital CLV servo is installed in the drive system servo circuit that controls disk rotation.<br>The digital CLV servo detects the rotation of the spindle motor and controls it with 10-bit resolution to maintain an accurate linear velocity regardless of the disk&#39;s inner or outer circumference. It also detects the difference in inertial mass between the 12 cm CD and 8 cm CD disks to drive more appropriately.<br><br>In order to prevent loss of trace accuracy due to vibration and resonance, a G-base unit is adopted as the base of the optical system mechanism.<br>The G-base unit is made by adding calcium carbonate, which has the same composition as marbles, to a special resin and strengthening it with glass fiber. By reducing the Kyoshin sharpness, the effect of external vibration is reduced and high rigidity is obtained.<br><br>An acoustic shield is mounted on the opening of the front panel where the tray is stored, and a damper made of special rubber material is installed to improve airtightness and reduce the effect of air vibration entering the chassis.<br>The tray itself uses a high-rigidity G tray made of the same material as the G base unit to prevent unwanted vibrations from being transmitted to the disk.<br><br>The FB chassis is used for the chassis structure, and the whole chassis is firmly joined by a frame surrounding the outer circumference and beams passing through the front and rear front and rear to realize a structure resistant to vibration. In addition, the CDP-X555ES uses copper plating inside the chassis to make it nonmagnetic.<br>Uses fine ceramic insulators for the legs.<br><br>The power supply section has a 2-transformer configuration and supplies power independently to the digital servo section and audio section. In addition, a power supply circuit is provided for the D/A converter section to eliminate interference from the power supply.<br>In addition, rubber dampers are used at four locations to prevent transmission of vibration from the transformer.<br><br>Consideration is also been given to the circuit board structure, and interference from the digital part to the analog part is suppressed by the separate sheet structure which separates the digital circuit board and the audio circuit board.<br>A high-strength glass-epoxy ES board is used for the audio circuit board to prevent degradation of sound quality due to vibration in the board and electrostatic floating capacity.<br><br>Aluminum panel is used for the front panel, and side wood is equipped on the side.<br><br></p>
