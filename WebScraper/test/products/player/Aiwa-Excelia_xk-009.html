				<p class="detail">This is a reference model cassette deck that pursues the ultimate analog deck and aims at the master&#39;s numerical value.<br><br>Equipped with an AMTS (Amti Modulation Tape Stabilizer) to reduce vibration of the cassette half.<br>In the AMTS, the cassette box is made of a two layer structure consisting of a non-magnetic aluminum plate and a non-resilient special rubber that has been thoroughly examined in terms of sound quality. The half body of the cassette box is accurately and securely clamped at a pressure of approximately 1 kg, greatly reducing modulation noise and tape running noise.<br><br>The mechanism part is equipped with a super stabilized tension dual capstan mechanism.<br>In this mechanism, two capstan units maintain a constant tape tension from the beginning to the end of winding. In addition, the capstan on the take-up side uses Aiwa&#39;s unique micro-grain processing technology to process the surface of the capstan into fine grains to prevent tape slippage and reduce deterioration of the tape and capstan itself.<br>Moreover, by adopting the frequency separation type dual capstan which changes the shaft diameter of two capstans, the overlap of the frequency is eliminated and the resonance is prevented.<br><br>A 3-motor configuration has been adopted, with one dedicated motor for FF/REW, one dedicated motor for capstan, and one dedicated motor for take-up during recording and rerecording. In addition, the dedicated motor for take-up is driven by a belt drive to improve sound quality. This eliminates cogging, which occurs by the method of training FF/REW.<br>In addition, high-precision processing has been applied to a heavy-weight flywheel made of zinc die-cast, and excellent characteristics have been realized by mounting one by one with dynamic balance.<br><br>The head block uses a 30g heavy weight zinc die cast head block that reduces modulation noise by suppressing fine head vibration. In addition, a bias shield is set on the head block to suppress bias leakage from the recording head wire to the reproducing head wire and signal leakage.<br><br>The recording and reproducing heads use an amorphous head with excellent saturation magnetic flux density, magnetic permeability, and abrasion resistance, and the head winding uses PC-OCC with purity of 99.997% and oxygen content of 5 ppm or less.<br>In addition, Aiwa&#39;s original design has been adopted for the head shape with sufficient consideration for contour effect, and the bumpiness in the low range is suppressed.<br><br>In the dual capstan mechanism, a higher constant tape tension is applied than in the single capstan mechanism, which increases the adhesion between the tape and the head. Therefore, when a normal ferrite material is used for the erase head, the high frequency degradation of the tape signal is caused by the spontaneous magnetization effect due to the coercive force = Hc (0.1 to 0.15) of the ferrite material. Therefore, a Sendust head with a low Hc of 0.007 to 0.02 is used for the erase head.<br><br>As a noise reduction system, Dolby B/C type is installed in dual and dbx is also installed.<br><br>Equipped with Dolby HX Pro, which improves the dynamic range and frequency characteristics of the high-frequency range.<br>In the Dolby HX Pro, the characteristics are improved by recording with the bias amount adjusted to the optimum state in units of 1/1000 second according to the high-frequency signal.<br>In addition, by making the circuit of Dolby HX Pro a discrete configuration, the optimum circuit constant is selected one by one according to the head to be used, and further high sound quality is achieved.<br><br>The PC-OCC wire is used to directly connect the PC-OCC wire between the PC-OCC winding and the PC-OCC wire between the PC-OCC winding and the PC-OCC wire between the PC-OCC winding and the PC-OCC wire between the PC-OCC winding and the PC-OCC wire between the PC-OCC winding and the PC-OCC wire between the PC-OCC winding and the PC-OCC wire between the PC-OCC winding<br>In addition, a specially developed low-noise, low-distortion, high-withstand voltage, and high-slew rate DC configuration amplifier is used as the amplifier element. Together with a high-precision equalizer element, it realizes an expanded dynamic range and higher sound quality.<br><br>A large-capacity power transformer is used in the power supply for the logic and signal systems. The digital signal of the logic system and the analog signal of the signal system are completely separated, and signal leakage from the digital system to the analog system and adverse effects are suppressed.<br>In addition, the transformer itself is designed to be vibration-proof with epoxy filler. Moreover, by setting the transformer outside the main body, adverse effects of flux and micro vibration generated by the power transformer on the tape head and signal system are eliminated.<br><br>The printed circuit boards for the mechanical logic system, display system and signal system are separated from each other, and an independent separation structure is adopted in which they are installed with sufficient space.<br>The mechanical logic system and the display system are isolated from each other by an internal chassis to eliminate interference with the signal system. In addition, the recording system and the reproduction system are completely separated from each other to prevent the effects on the reproduction system from the recording system signal and high-frequency bias during recording.<br><br>By eliminating as much as possible the routing of electronic switches, switching circuits, connectors, and print patterns that cause poor sound quality, we aim to achieve simple and straight signal transmission.<br>In addition, transmission mechanisms such as MPX circuit with through position and open-type muting circuit during performance that do not cause sound quality degradation when OFF are installed.<br><br>The bottom of the body is equipped with an insulator of unique structure, and the side is equipped with side wood to prevent resonance.<br>Vibration-proof materials are used for the top and bottom plates, and the recycled substrate is firmly fixed with two special holders and six special screws with flanges.<br><br>It is equipped with manual calibration. In addition, the built-in oscillator is set to 400 Hz and 10 kHz so that a wider range of frequency characteristics can be adjusted.<br>In addition, since the level meter is expanded to 0.5 dB steps during calibration, highly accurate calibration can be performed.<br><br>You can set up three levels of recording equalization depending on the recording source type and tape.<br>High emphasizes the low MOL (Maximum Output Level), Norm emphasizes the standard setting, and Low emphasizes the high MOL.<br><br>Equipped with a linear counter, the pulse from the left and right reel stands can be calculated at high speed, and both tape running positions can be digitally displayed in units of minutes and seconds. Display can be done in all running modes.<br>It is equipped with a pre-end winker that blinks three minutes before the tape end (when using C-60) to let you know when recording.<br><br>MPX filter and bias trap filter using PC-OCC winding and low-distortion core are adopted.<br><br>It is equipped with 24 segments x2ch peak hold peak meter.<br>This meter can be reset automatically or manually.<br><br>It uses a detent catalogue sound volume with excellent separation and crosstalk characteristics, and little left / right interlocking errors and sound quality degradation.<br><br>Uses 70 micron copper foil printed circuit board.<br><br>AC cord with polarity display using OFC material is adopted.<br><br>Gold-plated terminals are used for input / output terminals and headphone terminals.<br><br>It uses a metallized polyester film capacitor with a special three layer structure to reduce acoustic distortion.<br><br>OFC radiator plate is adopted.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
