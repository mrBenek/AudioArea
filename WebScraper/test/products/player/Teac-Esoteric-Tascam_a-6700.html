				<p class="detail">This is a separate type master recorder that embodies the idea of a teac for a high-grade two track deck.<br><br>Equipped with tension servo mechanism and impedance roller.<br>With the tension servo mechanism, the left tension arm detects changes in back tension caused by changes in the winding diameter of the feed reel, and feeds these changes back to the reel motor to keep the tension value within the optimum range at all times. This allows the tape to be protected by providing optimum tension even during constant speed running or rapid winding, and provides stable head touch. The speed change from the beginning to the end of winding is also minimal.<br>In addition, excellent wow and flutter characteristics have been obtained by the synergistic effect of the impedance roller with the large flywheel effect.<br><br>It uses a direct function logic circuit, so that it can be switched directly from any mode without going through the stop button.<br><br>Equipped with a motion sensing mechanism, when the PLAY button is pressed from the quick winding, the tape stops and the vehicle quickly moves to constant speed running.<br>This mechanism is equipped with a motion sensor that consists of a magnet and a magnetic diode incorporated in the guide roller. It sensitively catches the movement of the tape and operates to issue a command to immediately move to the next mode.<br><br>Equipped with NAB/BTS equalizer switching mechanism.<br>At 38 cm speeds, BTS equalization can improve the overall signal-to-noise ratio by approximately 2 dB compared to NAB by adding more high-frequency compensation during recording and reducing compensation during playback.<br><br>The erase head uses a full-track erase head that completely covers the width of the tape, and even 4-track recorded tapes can be erased cleanly.<br>In addition, the recording mode switch is of the same type for L and R to eliminate erroneous operation.<br><br>Equipped with 6-step switching of bias and continuously variable equalizer function, it is compatible with commercially available tapes and tapes expected to be commercially available in the future.<br><br>The tape monitor switch has a CAL position in addition to the conventional Source and Tape positions.<br>When the CAL button is pressed, the meter is calibrated to 0 VU = JIS standard level regardless of the position of the output volume. This can be used to check the recording level of tape or to use amplifiers or headphones with widely different input sensitivities.<br>In the OUT position, the meter indication is linked to the output volume.<br><br>A separate structure has been adopted to allow more freedom of installation.<br><br>The head housing is an opening and closing type.<br>In addition, the shield case of the read head is installed on the opening / closing lid, making it easy to use Derma and graph and easy to maintain.<br><br>It has a queueing mechanism.<br>High-speed monitoring is possible by pushing up the cue lever in the state of quick winding.<br><br>It uses a 4-track playhead.<br>High hardness permalloy head is used for the head.<br><br>Equipped with a recording mode standby lamp.<br>When the recording mode switch is turned ON, the red REC lamp flashes. When recording starts, the lamp lights up to indicate that recording is being performed.<br><br>Equipped with an independent volume fine adjustment mechanism for left and right channels.<br>In addition, it is equipped with a left-right interlocking master volume for easy operation such as fade in / fade out.<br><br>For playback, there is also an independent fine-tuning volume for left and right channels and a master volume linked to left and right channels.<br>The regeneration reference level of the master volume is the point indicated as 0 VU.<br><br>Equipped with peak indicator.<br>The lighting level is + 12 dB at 38 cm speed and + 10 dB at 19 cm speed. Since the lighting level is fixed for at least 70 ms depending on the memory circuit, there is no detection error.<br><br>Equipped with a microphone attenuator.<br>A timer recording and re-mechanism can be added by installing a timer control adapter sold separately.<br>Equipped with a separately sold remote control unit, it can be operated from a remote location.</p>
