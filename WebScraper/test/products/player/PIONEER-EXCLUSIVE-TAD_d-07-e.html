				<p class="detail">A DAT deck with 96 kHz high sampling and legato link conversion.<br><br>In order to record and play back high-frequency components exceeding 20 kHz, we have developed a wide-mode for high sampling by increasing the sampling frequency from 48 kHz to 96 kHz, which is twice the conventional frequency. As a result, the recording and playback frequency has reached 44 kHz, which is twice the conventional frequency. To achieve this technology, we have doubled the tape speed, increased the drum rotation speed from 2,000 rpm to 4,000 rpm in wide-mode, and doubled the head amplifier bandwidth from 4.7 MHz to 9.6 MHz.<br>* The ones recorded in the wide mode cannot be played back in the conventional standard SP mode or long-time LP mode, and the playback time in the wide mode is half of that in the SP mode.<br><br>With Legato Link Conversion for natural over-20kHz music playback even in standard mode.<br>Legato Link Conversion is a technology that brings the frequency components of natural sounds and music closer to the original signal waveform. It performs digital signal processing based on the signal recorded on the tape and connects the data with a smooth function curve, making it possible to reproduce sounds closer to the original before recording on the tape.<br>In addition, by estimating the original signal before recording and reproducing the sound at 20 kHz or higher according to the 1/f attenuation characteristics, more natural sound reproduction is achieved.<br><br>The A/D converter is equipped with an 18-bit multi-bit converter and a dither circuit to reduce non-linear and 0 cross distortion.<br>The D/A converter is equipped with an originally developed high-speed pulse-flow D/A converter, which operates at an extremely high oversampling of 256 fs for smoother and more natural sound reproduction.<br>The system clock employs a clean clock circuit that supplies audio and digital signals separately. By driving the oscillation itself of the clock that controls the system independently, the SN ratio and distortion factor are improved.<br><br>The head is equipped with an AT (All Track) head.<br>In order to respond to the high speed head rotation in the wide mode, precision technology has been put into it. It has an AT structure with 20 μ m uniform track processing in the track trace direction. In addition, glass is welded on both sides of the head to improve abrasion resistance, and special polishing processing is applied to the gap to improve tape touch stability.<br><br>We have reduced the impact of vibration by using panel stabilizers with rubber vibration isolators to reduce vibration around the front panel, cassette stabilizers to securely hold tapes and prevent sound quality degradation due to vibration, honeycomb chassis to support mechanisms and circuits, large insulators, and hood vibration control structures.<br><br>It is equipped with a character recording function (character pack) that allows you to record your favorite information such as song title and title. At the beginning of each song (start ID part), you can record up to 60 characters of your favorite information such as song title, performer&#39;s name and source title. Data can be recorded either on the remote control or on the main body.<br>The recorded information is scrolled on the display at the start of each song and can be displayed again by pressing the button while the song is playing.<br><br>It is equipped with a CD-Q code sync start ID recording function. When recording digital input from a CD, the start ID is automatically recorded based on the track number and index in the CD-Q code data transmitted to the D-07 through the digital interface. In addition to the conventional detection of the replacement of each song with two second silence, the start ID can be recorded without any silence between songs.<br>This eliminates the recording error of the start ID due to the fade-in and fade-out portions.<br><br>It is equipped with a Table of Contents (TOC) function that records information such as the total number of songs and the total time of the tape, the playing time of each song, the starting time of each song, and the remaining amount of recording space at the beginning of the tape.<br><br>Equipped with digital faders, fade in and fade out functions for digital input recording, playback, analog input recording, and playback.<br>In addition, the operation functions at the time of playback include random play, in which a microcomputer randomly selects and plays music based on TOC information, time skip, in which a desired time is skipped forward or backward from the current position, one point memory, in which the microcomputer memorizes the point on the tape when a button is pressed and plays that point with one touch, and fine cue / review, which is convenient for recording the start ID and tracking.<br><br>In addition to the standard SP mode, it is equipped with three modes : a wide mode capable of recording and playback in a wide band up to 44 kHz, and a long-time LP mode with a maximum of 4 hours (when using 120 minutes of tape), which is advantageous for air check of satellite broadcasting and FM broadcasting.<br><br>We use carefully selected parts to respond to the demand for broadband.</p>
