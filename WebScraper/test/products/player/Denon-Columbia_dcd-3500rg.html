				<p class="detail">A CD player with Real 20-bit Λ -S. L. C.<br><br>Real 20-bit Λ (LAMBDA) -S. L. C is used for the D/A conversion part.<br>LAMBDA stands for Ladder-form Multiple Bias D/A. Using a newly developed LSI, digital data is divided into two systems, each of which is shifted by applying digital bias in plus and minus directions near the 0 cross point, thereby eliminating 0 cross distortion in principle.<br>With this method, when the reproduced digital data is smaller than the shift amount, there is no value crossing the original 0 cross point, so no 0 cross distortion occurs. When the two shifted data are added after D/A conversion, the DC component is removed and the two shifted data are combined. Thus, an analog output with no 0 cross distortion can be obtained. The two data have no MSB inversion, and no 0 cross distortion occurs in the combined waveform. Even if any bit is distorted, the average of the two signals reduces the distortion to 1/2.<br>In addition, when the reproduced digital data is at a level larger than the shift amount, it crosses the original 0 cross point, which may cause distortion. However, in this case, the distortion is removed by the MSB correction of the super linear converter. In addition, when there is a momentary peak level (more than about 99.6% of the maximum level) that is completely absent or only a few times in a piece of music, LAMBDA stops the shift operation and uses the converter&#39;s dynamic range to ensure a wide dynamic range.<br>The DDCD 3500 rg uses a 4D/A system instead of the conventional 2D/A converter system, which brings out the performance of the lambda system and greatly improves the SN ratio.<br><br>The digital filter uses a 20-bit 8 x oversampling digital filter.<br><br>In the analog circuit, interference between channels is eliminated by making the L/R configuration completely independent of the signal flow.<br><br>The power supply is equipped with a digital transformer and an analog transformer independently to reduce interference between the digital and analog sections.<br>We also use carefully selected parts such as large electrolytic capacitors for power supply circuits.<br><br>In order to prevent digital noise from entering the analog circuit, the circuit board is completely isolated.<br>In addition, bus bar lines, which are used only for commercial machines, are used for analog circuits to reduce ground impedance and prevent high frequencies from jumping in.<br><br>The pickup part is floating by coil spring and low repulsion viscoelastic rubber to eliminate the effect of vibration.<br>In addition, the vibration absorption effect is enhanced by using BMC (bulk molding compound) with large internal loss as a double BMC mechanical base that is used for both the pickup mechanical base and the mechanical chassis.<br><br>The chassis eliminates the effect of internal vibration by dividing the mechanical part and power supply part, which may cause vibration, and the circuit system, in which the effect of vibration affects sound quality, into two parts by the center partition wall. In addition, the chassis adopts a double structure and the insulator uses sintered alloy to achieve complete vibration isolation.<br>The chassis is fully copper-plated to guard against radio waves and porcelain noise.<br><br>Uses gold hairline finish front panel and glossy wood cabinet.<br><br>Equipped with a display dimmer function, you can adjust four levels of brightness : standard, approximately 2/3, approximately 1/3, and all lights off.<br><br>Equipped with a variable output volume linked to a headphone.<br>It also comes with headphones and a variable output ON/OFF switch.<br><br>It is equipped with two coaxial and one optical digital outputs.<br><br>It is equipped with time search, and it is possible to start the music by time designation and repeat performance between 2 points.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
