				<p class="detail">Cassette deck with cassette upright loading system.<br><br>It uses a mechanism developed exclusively for the vertical type, and it can be loaded upright like a modern general cassette deck.<br>This eliminates the performance degradation that occurs when the conventional horizontal mechanism is used vertically.<br><br>The drive motor is an electronically controlled DC-motor, and the capstan is a high-precision capstan with a roundness of 0.1 μ or less, which reduces wow and flutter to less than 0.06%.<br>In addition, the use of large zinc-die-cast flywheels improves the flywheel effect and reduces wow flutter and ensures stable tape travel.<br><br>0.4 mm thick flat belt is exclusively used for the capstan drive belt. By using flat belt, expansion and contraction changes caused by conventional thickness are prevented as much as possible, and wow flutter characteristics are pursued.<br>In the past, a single belt was used to drive both the fly-wheel (capstan) and the take-up reel at the same time. However, in the SC-3, a dedicated flat belt for the fly-wheel and a dedicated belt for the take-up reel are used to drive each of them independently. This prevents the capstan from being affected by load fluctuations and vibrations that occur during the take-up process, making it possible to record and play more beautiful sound.<br><br>It uses cassette reverse insertion prevention weather to protect tapes and mechanism from malfunction.<br>In addition, the cassette door has a large transparent window and is equipped with an illumination lamp so that it is possible to see the tape running, the remaining amount of the tape, and the number of songs.<br>In addition, the cassette door can be removed for easy degaussing and cleaning of the tape head, capstan, pinch roller, etc.<br><br>A quick change system is adopted in the operation part, and switching from play, rewind, fast forward, pause, etc. mode is possible without going through the stop button.<br><br>It adopts an original full auto-stop mechanism using a pure electronic system.<br>The tape stops running at the end of each mode such as play, rewind and fast forward, and the operation buttons return to their original state.<br>This mechanism generates pulses while the tape is running, and when the tape stops running, the generation of pulses also stops and the operation button is automatically returned to its original state.<br><br>A ポースボタン with a lock mechanism is adopted.<br>During locking, the pinch roller is separated from the capstan to prevent deformation due to crimping of the pinch roller.<br>Rewind and fast forward operation can be performed even when locked.<br><br>Equipped with timer start mechanism, by combining with timer sold separately, it is possible to record absence and play alarm clock.<br><br>The Dolby System is installed as a noise reduction system.<br>The Dolby circuit employs a dedicated IC jointly developed by Dolby Research Laboratories and Signetics, Inc. of the United States. This eliminates the need for conventional adjustment and prevents changes in Dolby characteristics caused by misalignment and aging.<br><br>Ultra-hard permalloy head with 1.6 μ narrow-gap finish is used for the read / write head.<br><br>Two low-noise transistors are used in the microphone circuit to achieve a high S/N ratio and a wide range of impedance, which guarantees linearity of 40 dB for the specified input level.<br>In line recording, the input does not go through a microphone circuit, but is a circuit dedicated to line recording. Therefore, deterioration of the S/N ratio and distortion rate is suppressed.<br><br>Equipped with a VU meter.<br>The SC-3 emphasizes the circuit of the VU meter and adopts two dedicated circuits per one channel. Along with the improvement of the scale accuracy, the dan-pin of the pointer is also good and accurate indication is possible.<br><br>The equalizer uses a 2-stage NF type circuit with a large S/N ratio and dynamic range. It is equipped with a normal tape (LH) and a tape selector with a new time constant of 3180 μ S + 70 μ S.<br>By this, in addition to normal tape and chrome tape, ferrichrome tape is also supported.<br><br>Equipped with output level control.<br>It also has independent left and right recording level controls.<br><br>Equipped with 3-digit index counter.<br><br>Equipped with REC / Dolby indicator using LED.<br><br>Equipped with DIN recording / playback outlet.<br><br>Equipped with an L/R independent microphone input terminal.<br><br>It has a headphone port.</p>
