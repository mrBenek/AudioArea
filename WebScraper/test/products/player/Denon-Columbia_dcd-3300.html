				<p class="detail">A CD player that brings together technology as a reference machine for DENON CD player.<br><br>The DCD-3300 and DCD-3300gold are identical except for the appearance.<br><br>The pickup section is equipped with a laser pickup using a tracking error detection method with three beams, which was originally developed by utilizing the know-how of commercial and broadcast CD players.<br>In addition, a linear motor system is adopted for the drive part of the pickup mechanism to ensure high-speed access and reliable tracing by quick response and high-precision speed detection.<br><br>As for the pickup mechanism, a thick slide shaft designed to prevent resonance is mounted on a newly developed BMC base composed of ceramics, and the whole mechanism is fully floating with a new structure.<br><br>The spindle motor for rotating the disk employs a high-torque large Hall motor capable of quick start-up and smooth rotation, and realizes a structure capable of high-speed access and resistant to external vibration.<br>In addition, in order to eliminate tracking errors caused by slight errors in the center hole of the CD disk, an automatic alignment turntable mechanism is installed.<br><br>The D/A converter uses an independent W super linear converter for the left and right sides.<br>The W super linear converter combines a super linear converter that completely eliminates 0 cross distortion and a double D/A converter that eliminates the time difference between the left and right channels.<br>The Super Linear Converter is a technology used in all digital (PCM) sound recorders in our studio. Conversion errors are corrected by adjusting the external weighting current. By thoroughly eliminating 0 cross distortion, noise pollution at the time of small signals is eliminated, enabling high-precision D/A conversion.<br>In addition, by adopting a double D/A converter system in which the left and right channels are completely independent of the digital filter, we have achieved excellent separation while eliminating the left and right time difference.<br><br>The digital filter uses a 4 x oversampling digital filter.<br>The 4-times oversampling digital filter is a linear-phase FIR type filter that provides an output of 176.4 kHz, which is four times the standard sampling frequency of 44.1 kHz. This filter shifts unwanted high-frequency noise to a higher frequency range of 156.4 kHz or higher, separating the audio signal from high-frequency noise.<br><br>The analog filter is equipped with Denon&#39;s proprietary C. A. L. P. (Computer Analyzed Linear Phase) seventh order analog low-pass filter, which removes only high-frequency noise and improves group delay characteristics and in-band ripple.<br>This filter uses high-quality parts such as LC-OFC coils and copper-polypropylene capacitors to improve transmission performance.<br><br>The internal structure is a digital-analog independent design to eliminate the influence of digital noise.<br>The digital circuit and analog circuit are separated on the circuit board, and the output of the digital circuit is converted into light by optical coupling through a photo isolator and transmitted to the analog circuit to eliminate interference between the circuits.<br>In addition, a twin power transformer is installed in the power supply section, and five dedicated stabilizing circuits supply each section separately to realize a high-purity circuit that eliminates all noise components.<br><br>To eliminate the influence of radio noise emitted by digital circuits in space, we have adopted a copper-plated main chassis and double-sided copper foil glass epoxy board. Circuit noise through 100 v lines is prevented by line filters and a very thick AC cord with polarity display.<br><br>The cabinet structure uses a bi-brace bottom chassis and a fully copper-plated main chassis. It is surrounded by an aluminum decorative chassis and a bi-brace bottom plate to create a solid double structure.<br>The bi-breath bottom plate has a three layer laminate structure with two steel plates sandwiched by polymer sheets (damping material), and has excellent vibration damping characteristics.<br>In addition, an insulator with a diameter of approximately 6 cm made of brass and a total weight of approximately 1.2 kg is used for the leg part. The center of gravity is distributed downward, the weight of the CD player is increased, and the structure is strong against shaking and vibration.<br><br>Digital outputs include one optical system and two coaxial systems. The digital output can be turned off on the DCD 3300.<br>In addition, one fixed analog output and two variable analog output including 600 Ω balanced output are mounted.<br><br>With a built-in time search key, you can start playing by selecting minutes and seconds. You can also return to that time every time you press the Play key. In addition, if you press the Time Search key in the middle of a song, the location is memorized, and quick replay is performed every time you press the Play key.<br><br>It is equipped with a program function of up to 20 songs that can be played by timer.<br><br>15-item intelligent display capability.<br>When the CD is stopped, the total number of songs and the total time can be displayed regardless of the disc or program. While playing, the track, index and the elapsed time of the song can be displayed. The Time Mode key enables you to display the remaining time of the song and the total remaining time of the disc. While playing a program, the total remaining time of the program can be displayed.<br>In addition, it is equipped with the next song number display, and you can see the number of remaining songs with the music calendar and the program order with the Call key.<br><br>Equipped with an auto-space function, the silence between songs is adjusted to approximately 4 seconds.<br><br>Repeat in track order or program order is possible.<br><br>It is equipped with search functions such as index search, auto search and manual search.<br><br>It has a headphone port with volume linked to output line out.<br><br>Equipped with timer connection function, time search and memory playback are possible.<br><br>In order to cope with pre-emphasized CDs, a de-emphasis circuit using high-precision parts is adopted.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
