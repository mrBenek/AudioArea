				<p class="detail">This is a cassette deck based on ZX-7 with improvements mainly on the mechanism and amplifier.<br><br>The mechanism uses a direct drive system using Nakamichi&#39;s unique super linear torque DD motor.<br>This motor has been developed focusing on flutter components that do not appear in figures on specifications, and is designed to eliminate uneven torque of the motor, which causes flutter.<br>A general motor rotates by the repulsive force of S and N of the magnetic field, and when the coil moves from the S pole to the N pole, the pole is switched and the torque becomes 0 instantaneously. In order to eliminate this 0 torque state, a general motor increases the number of driving coils to use two or three phases. However, when each phase turns on or off alternately, torque unevenness occurs.<br>To solve this problem, Nakamichi has come up with a method that creates three torques that vary sinusoidally with time and ensures that the resultant torque is always 1 in order to maintain constant torque at any moment. This method is used in the Super Linear Torque DD Motor.<br>In the Super Linear Torque DD motor, the current supplied to the coil is a 2-phase sinusoidal wave and the magnet is also a ring-shaped one with star-shaped magnetization to form a sinusoidal wave with the strength of the S pole and the N pole, thereby eliminating torque unevenness.<br>By adopting this motor, we have achieved excellent characteristics in the double-capstan system in which lowering the wow flutter is difficult.<br><br>As a noise reduction system, Dolby B type and C type are mounted.<br><br>Equipped with 3 types of tape selectors.<br>In addition, in order to maximize the performance of each tape, it is equipped with a bias adjustment mechanism independent of the left and right, a recording and playback level adjustment mechanism independent of the left and right, and an azimuth adjustment mechanism.<br><br>The mechanism uses a closed-loop dual capstan system to reduce modulation noise, and in the ZX-9, by changing the diameters of the two capstan, the inherent resonance frequencies of the capstan can be changed to avoid overlapping of flutter periods.<br>In addition, two types of materials, aluminum and plastic, are used for the entire structure to absorb vibrations before they are transmitted to the head and tape.<br><br>N-MOS4-bit microprocessor is used for the mechanism drive part.<br>In the ZX-9, the tape control mechanism is driven by a motor and a cam, and the operating position is transmitted to the microcomputer by attaching a potentiometer to the control cam of the mechanism. This method enables quieter and smoother operation than the method of driving the mechanism with a plunger.<br>In addition, because it can move quickly, it is possible to find the head accurately like a open-reel.<br><br>The head has a 3-head configuration with completely independent recording, playback, and erasing heads.<br><br>The recording equalizer circuit and the playback equalizer circuit are connected directly to the head without using a condenser, thereby eliminating sound quality degradation.<br>In addition, the recording equalizer circuit and monitor amplifier are double-NF circuits that apply NFB to an electrolytic capacitor, and the playback equalizer circuit is DC-operated to reduce distortion.<br><br>Equipped with an auto-playback function, you can stop at the position of the tape counter 0000 after fast forward or rewind and start playback automatically.<br><br>With the Easy Queuing function, you can listen to your recording at a reduced speed in fast-forward or rewind mode. You can select a queuing speed of 1/3 or 1/6. You can also stop in queuing mode and start playback from a pause state.<br><br>It is equipped with -up recording function, you can switch to recording mode while driving during playback.<br><br>The master fader control function allows you to fade in and fade out.<br>The switch has 2 stages, and you can choose 2 speeds of 6 seconds when you press it once and release it, and 2 seconds when you keep it pressed.<br><br>Equipped with a Rec Mute function, you can record without a signal as long as you press the switch.<br><br>Equipped with a 50 db full-scale wide-range LED peak level meter that digitally displays -40dB to + 10 db with 16 segments for L/R respectively.<br>This meter can also be used as an adjustment meter for level / bias calibration. Especially for bias calibration, the indicated value is increased by 20 dB to make it easier to adjust.<br><br>Equipped with a tape counter with a digital LED display that allows for positive counting up to 9999 and negative counting up to -999.<br><br>Equipped with a timer recording and playback mechanism. By using a separately sold timer together, you can record your absence or play an alarm clock.<br><br>It can be operated from a remote location by using the optional remote control unit.</p>
