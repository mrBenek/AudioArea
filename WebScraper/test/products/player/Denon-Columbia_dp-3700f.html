				<p class="detail">A record player corresponding to the upgraded model of DP 3700.<br><br>The DP 3700 f has improved its vibration isolation performance by improving the cabinet and arm base.<br><br>DP-3000 is adopted for the turntable part.<br>The DP-3000 uses a direct drive system for its drive system, and DENON&#39;s unique high-precision magnetic recording and playback system for rotational speed detection.<br>In the magnetic recording / reproducing system, the voltage applied to the motor is controlled by comparing the voltage obtained from the actual rotation of the turntable with a reference voltage. The voltage from the turntable is obtained by detecting pulses magnetically recorded with high precision on the inner circumference of the turntable with a magnetic head and converting them into voltages corresponding to their frequencies. There are 1000 pulses, and the pulse interval is recorded with an accuracy of 1/10000. This pulse enables extremely accurate speed detection and extremely fast and sufficient servocontrol. Wow flutter is suppressed to 0.03% or less. In addition, stable rotation is maintained even when load conditions such as needle pressure change.<br><br>The servo circuit is fully temperature compensated and has a built-in DC stabilizing power supply to prevent the rotational speed from being affected by fluctuations in the power supply frequency, voltage, and temperature.<br><br>Solid rotor type AC servo motor is used as the drive motor.<br>Compared to other synchronous motors and DC motors, this motor has smooth rotation characteristics with less vibration. However, it is driven by AC with a beautifully shaped waveform, so there is almost no rumble.<br><br>By adopting an accurate and quick response speed detection system and a stable servo system, the weight of the turntable has been reduced. As a result, the starting characteristic is less than 1/2 revolution, and the bearing load of the motor is light, so that stable performance can be maintained over a long period of time.<br><br>Speed switching by electric switch is adopted.<br><br>Fine adjustment of speed is possible, and adjustment of ± 3% of the specified speed is possible.<br><br>The tone arm uses DA 305, a model conforming to the broadcast station specifications.<br>Designed for safe use with light needle pressure cartridges, the DA 305 is a laterally balanced S-shape. The needle pressure adjustment is a micrometer type direct reading type with 0 to 1g per rotation, and the cartridge can be used over a wide range of weight from 4g to 15g.<br><br>In order to maintain high sensitivity and high reliability, the rotary bearing section has the same consideration as the arm for broadcasting station.<br>The horizontal rotation axis consists of two high-grade miniature bearings protected by a double housing. The vertical rotation part consists of an angular contact bearing protected by a special elastic material with little friction change combined with a quenched and precision polished pivot, making it stable against external vibration and impact while minimizing resonance of the arm itself.<br><br>It uses a special low-capacity output cord and is compatible with MM type cartridges with high output impedance and 4-channel record playback.<br>In addition, the connector is gold-plated to eliminate troubles caused by poor contact.<br><br>The cabinet is made of laminated plywood with a thickness of 70 mm to increase the mass and suppress resonance of the cabinet itself.<br>In addition, a mechanical filter of viscoelastic material is used between the arm base and the cabinet to absorb the vibration of the cabinet transmitted to the tone arm.<br><br>A height adjustable insulator is used for the leg part to absorb vibration from the floor.</p>
