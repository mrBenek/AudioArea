				<p class="detail">Stereo cassette deck equipped with DBX and Dolby B / C.<br><br>The dbx system and DolbyB C are installed as noise reduction systems.<br>In the dbx system, the signal level is linearly compressed to 1/2 before recording and then expanded twice during playback. The recording saturation level is improved by more than 10 dB without losing the quality of the original sound. Moreover, noise can be reduced by more than 30 dB over the entire audio band. In addition, dbx records can be played by operating the NR selector.<br>The Dolby C NR is a higher quality version of the Dolby B NR. It provides an NR drop from the mid-range range. In addition, new anti-distortion circuits have been introduced to suppress high-frequency clipping and high-range range and reduce noise by 20 dB at 10 kHz. This is achieved by reducing saturation at 10 kHz.<br><br>A D. D. 3-motor mechanism is used for the mechanism part.<br>In this mechanism, the capstan faced D. D. motor is used for the capstan. The motor itself becomes a capstan. By directly driving the capstan, highly accurate transport performance is achieved. In addition, this motor is designed so that the rotor (magnet) section rotates while being connected to the stator (coil) section. Not only the accuracy of the capstan rotation but also the stability is improved. In addition, by detecting the output from the FG (frequency oscillator) built into the flat-faced D. D. capstan around the entire circumference of the rotor, the rotation is accurately controlled and the accuracy of the drop of the dbx system is achieved.<br>In addition, two DC motors that boast stable rotation are installed for the reel and ff/rew. The ff/rew motor is designed to operate the head block and eliminates the large plunger from the head block, making the head touch smoother and more reliable.<br><br>By adopting computer logic control, advanced mechanism is controlled precisely, and moreover, direct change from ff and rew to play is possible.<br><br>The recording / reproducing head uses an AX amorphous head that incorporates an amorphous alloy into the head material.<br>The AX head has excellent characteristics, such as low high-frequency loss and magnetostriction, high saturation magnetic flux density and high hardness. It is ideal as a head material. The AX head has been precisely processed on a laminate of amorphous alloy.<br>A double-gap ferrite head with high demagnetization capability is used for the erasing head.<br><br>A newly developed IC is used in the amplifier circuit, and flat characteristics and high SN ratio are obtained by eliminating parts and lead wires as much as possible.<br>In addition, a high-gain amplifier is installed for exclusive use for headphones.<br><br>Equipped with an auto tape selector that automatically sets the optimum tape position.<br>With this tape selector, the wire detects the detection hole provided on the backside of the cassette half and sets it to the normal / CrO2 / metal positions.<br>The set tape position is confirmed by the front panel LEDs.<br><br>Equipped with a bias adjustment volume that can manually adjust the optimum bias current value according to the type of tape.<br>The bias current value can be controlled by ± 25% and by ± 5 db in the high frequency range of 10 khz.<br><br>Equipped with an intro search function that plays only the intro part for about 10 seconds.<br>This introsearch is designed to start playback from the beginning of the song and play it for about 10 seconds. At the beginning of the song, the system detects the unrecorded portion, passes it once, and rewinds it in an instant to play it from the beginning of the song.<br>The indicator also lights up when the intro search is activated, and blinks at high pitch during fast forward and at slow pitch during partial play of the intro.<br><br>It is equipped with a function to select 20 songs by jumping.<br>The music number is set while looking at the display of the digital counter, and the computer finds the indicated music by pressing the music select button and then pressing the ff key or rew key.<br><br>You can repeat three types of music from the beginning to the end of the tape, from the beginning to any 000 position, or from any 000 position to the end.<br><br>Equipped with a 4-way digital counter, it is possible to display real-time remaining tape quantity, display of 20-track jump instruction, display of rec-mute elapsed time, and display of 3-digit tape count.<br><br>It is equipped with a wide range 3-color FL display compatible with dbx. The range from -40dB to + 18 dB is divided into 3 colors. When the NR selector is set to the dbx position, + 8 dB or more turns red.<br>It also has an auto-reset peak-hold function that catches the peak signal of music and holds it for a few seconds.<br><br>Equipped with an auto input selector that automatically switches to microphone input when the microphone plug is turned on.<br><br>Equipped with a timer mechanism capable of recording and rerecording at the specified time by connecting a timer.<br><br>Equipped with Rec Pause, Rec Mute, Pause, Output Volume and Soft Eject.<br><br>There are 2 variations, silver and black.</p>
