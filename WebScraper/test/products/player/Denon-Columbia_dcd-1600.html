				<p class="detail">A CD player that inherits the DCD 3300 technology.<br><br>A W super linear converter is used for the D/A converter.<br>The DCD-1600 W super-linear converter consists of a super-linear converter and a double D/A converter.<br>In general, a D/A converter consists of 16 pairs of precise resistors. Slight errors in the resistance value can cause a variable 換歪 and sound quality degradation. Therefore, in the Super Linear Converter, conversion errors are compensated by external weighting current adjustment, and 0 cross distortion is completely eliminated. In the D/A converter, an IC made by Barr Brown of the United States is used.<br>In addition, the double-D/A converter eliminates the time difference between the left and right channels caused by the CD recording method by processing the sound of the left and right tracks independently.<br><br>Digital Filter A four times over-sampling digital filter is used. A linear-phase FIR circuit produces an output of 176.4 kHz, four times the standard sampling frequency. This allows unwanted high-frequency noise to be shifted to the higher frequency range and cut off with a low-order analog filter. This improves the quality of the product.<br><br>The pickup section is equipped with a laser pickup that uses a 3-beam tracking error detection system.<br>In addition, a newly developed linear motor mechanism has been adopted for the pickup drive to improve reliability, stability and durability.<br><br>BMC with high vibration absorption effect is adopted for the base part of the mechanism.<br>In addition, low-repulsion rubber and springs are used for full floating to ensure complete vibration isolation.<br><br>The power supply section uses four independent power supply circuits that supply power separately to the digital signal processing, pickup servo, display and audio sections, thereby preventing sound quality degradation due to mutual noise and voltage fluctuations.<br><br>The top plate of the cabinet has a double structure. The bottom plate has a vibration resistant structure consisting of a bi-brace plate used for the DCD 3300 and a double 1.6 mm thick steel plate. The insulator is a heavy type with a sintered alloy covered with an aluminum cover to thoroughly reduce vibration.<br>In addition, the DCD 1600 uses a bi-breath plate for the base of the power transformer and a high-density, high-rigidity material for the main part of the disc holder to enhance vibration isolation.<br><br>Equipped with a digital output.<br>This terminal can be turned ON/OFF by switching the switch on the front panel.<br><br>Equipped with a 20-track program function that can be used during timer play.<br><br>Equipped with an auto space function, the silence between songs can be adjusted to approximately 4 seconds.<br><br>You can repeat all tracks in track order, all tracks in program order, one track, or between A and B.<br><br>Equipped with a headphone port with volume.<br><br>Equipped with an auto-edit function that demonstrates the power of recording to a tape.<br>If you press the Auto Edit key while the disc is in the stop state, you can display the total playing time and number of songs in the first half of the total playing time of the CD divided by almost half for approximately two seconds, display the remaining second half, and pause at the head of the song in Track 1.<br>In addition, the sound is automatically paused at approximately 1/2 of the total playing time.<br><br>It is equipped with a de-emphasis circuit and can also play pre-emphasized CDs.<br>The DCD 1600 uses optical coupling for switching this circuit to prevent digital noise from entering the audio circuit.<br><br>Timer connection is possible.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
