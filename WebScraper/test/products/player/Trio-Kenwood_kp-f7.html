				<p class="detail">A player system that pursues basic performance and performs full-automatic operation under computer control.<br><br>The tone arm employs a straight-tone arm that achieves both high rigidity due to the composite structure and reduced effective mass of the pickup system. In addition, the inside for scan seller prevents unnecessary vibration from being transmitted to the needle tip by only making contact with the tone arm body with the thread only. Carbon fiber is used for the head shell and connect holder to achieve high rigidity and weight reduction.<br><br>The cabinet is a composite molded cabinet made of FRP, which is made of polyester base resin, glass fiber, synthetic stone made of calcium carbonate, or synthetic fiber.<br>The material itself is a composite structure, and at the same time, the tone arm supporting point and the turntable supporting point are integrated with ribs to form a mechanical showering structure, and the distance between both supporting points is clarified to obtain excellent vibration damping characteristics.<br><br>We have adopted a coreless slotless DC servo motor for the turntable drive motor to eliminate cogging, which is said to be inevitable in direct drive motors.<br>We have also adopted a quartz PLL for the servo system and an all-round integration method for motor speed detection to improve rotational stability.<br>In addition, the bearing part of the motor is composed of BSBM material, and the hard stainless steel shaft is held all over, and by clarifying the rotation support point, it is 330 kg ・ cm.<sup>2</sup>Turns the large inertia turntable smoothly.<br><br>The cartridge is a VM type manufactured by Orthophone.<br><br>A static type anti-skating mechanism is adopted in the inside four scan cellar that cancels out harmful inside forces.<br>The needle is moved faithfully to the sound groove without applying unnecessary force to the needle tip so that a faithful trace can be obtained.<br><br>Using a microprocessor developed independently by Trio, it centrally controls all operations such as auto operation of the arm, rotation speed control of the quartz motor, and power ON / OFF during memory tracing.<br>Manual operation has priority and manual operation is possible even during auto operation.<br><br>Equipped with a unique direct repeat mechanism, the arm repeats as soon as it returns to the edge of the record board. Since there is no time to return to the arm rest, it is possible to continuously play all songs on one side.<br><br>Equipped with a needle tip protection mechanism, the arm does not wrap even if the Play switch is pressed unless the record size is specified.<br><br>Equipped with queuing automatic release mechanism, queuing is automatically released when the arm is returned to the rest.<br><br>All operations can be remotely controlled by using the separately sold remote controller RC-500.<br>It is also equipped with a convenient memory trace mechanism that allows you to turn off the power of the entire system after the recording is finished if you instruct to turn off the power during the recording.</p>
