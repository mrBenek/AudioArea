				<p class="detail">A cassette deck employing the closed-loop dual capstan system.<br><br>Closed loop dual capstan system is adopted for the mechanism part.<br>In this system, the tape travel system is composed of two sets of capstan and pinch rollers centered on the head. This system maintains a constant tape tension, greatly reduces modulation noise, and realizes stable tape travel.<br><br>A digital servo quartz DD motor is used for the capstan motor.<br>By directly comparing the reference clock generated by the quartz oscillation with the FG pulse generated by the motor circuit, extremely stable rotational accuracy is ensured.<br>In addition, by increasing the torque by about three times that of conventional products, accurate tape speed can be achieved with margin.<br><br>Zinc die-cast is used for the flywheel of the DD motor, and torque ripple is suppressed by high-precision processing with dynamic balance of 0.1g/cm or less. In addition, by high-precision multipole magnetized FG magnet with magnetization center offset of 10 μ m or less, FG pulse itself generated from magnetic material and coil is kept with extremely high accuracy, and stability of speed and phase is improved.<br><br>Two different materials, zinc die-cast and aluminum die-cast, are used in the frame for mounting the driving mechanism, and TNRC base is used for the chassis to achieve high vibration resistance.<br><br>It employs a power assist cassette loading system, and by driving a cam with a special motor, a high-rigidity cassette holder containing glass fibers is firmly held in place in the mechanism. In addition, the cassette half stabilizer holds the half from above to minimize vibration of the half itself caused by tape running.<br><br>To handle tapes with different sensitivities and characteristics depending on the manufacturer and type, it is equipped with Level &amp; Bias Calibration, which can compensate for recording sensitivity differences independent of left and right and for sound quality differences in the high-frequency range.<br><br>Linear Magnefield Class AA is used for the recording amplifier section. The recording amplifier consists of a voltage-controlled amplifier and a current supply amplifier. As a result, both gain and phase of the signal magnetic field generated by the head remain the output signal of the voltage-controlled amplifier, greatly improving the waveform response of the magnetic field.<br><br>It is equipped with APRS which can easily set recording level.<br>When a signal is input in the recording pause state and the APRS button is turned ON, the maximum level of the input signal can be held and displayed on the meter. In this state, simply moving the knob will move the hold level on the meter according to the input signal, making it easy to set the recording level.<br><br>Equipped with range switching type level meter, level display can be switched between 2 dB step and 1 dB step.<br><br>Equipped with Dolby HX-PRO, the high-frequency recording characteristics can be greatly improved.<br><br>A Dolby B/C is installed as a noise reduction system.<br><br>Equipped with linear electronic counter, memory stop and memory repeat can be performed.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
