				<p class="detail">The optical transmission system is a CD player adopting D/A separation two block structure.<br><br>In order to eliminate digital noise such as servo current noise of digital circuits and clock pulses of microcomputers, an optica link (optical transmission method) using a photocoupler is adopted.<br>In addition, by using separate boards for the digital &amp; servo circuit and the analog circuit, the analog circuit is mechanically and electrically separated, eliminating the sound quality degradation caused by noise interference.<br><br>It is equipped with two digital outputs which are coaxial with the optical system.<br><br>The digital filter uses a newly developed 4-times oversampling digital filter, which realizes 266 order operation, 100 dB out-of-band attenuation characteristics, and ± 0.0001 dB in-band ripple.<br>As a result, the analog filter at the latter stage can be made loose and simple, reducing phase shift and distortion.<br><br>The D/A converter employs a newly developed high-speed fine D/A converter using an independent high-speed I-V amplifier.<br>The SN ratio and dynamic range have been expanded by greatly increasing the conversion speed to voltage compared to the conventional one.<br><br>A lightweight, high-precision 3-beam pickup is used for the pickup part.<br>In this pickup, the response speed is improved by shortening the distance between the main beam for reading signals and the two sub-beams. In addition, the weight of the moving part is reduced to 1/2 of the conventional weight, and the tracing performance is improved. This reduces excess servo current and greatly reduces servo noise.<br><br>The chassis structure uses a newly developed silent base in addition to a large insulated foot.<br>The SILENT BASE has a 3-layer structure with a special synthetic resin as a core. It has extremely high internal loss and low resonance. Moreover, it has a low center of gravity due to its weight, which reduces vibration structurally.<br><br>Non-resonance and non-vibration are achieved by adopting IS mechanism k.<br>The IS mechanism has a structure in which the disk drive system and the pickup system are set on one base and floating mounted by an insulation system using special rubber. This double anti-vibration structure eliminates disturbance vibration and sound pressure from speakers.<br><br>It has an editing function that automatically programs according to the tape time.<br><br>Program playback of 32 songs is possible.<br>Program operations can be performed in the tray eject state, and additional memory is available during performance.<br><br>It has a random play function.<br><br>It is equipped with an intro-scan function that plays back the head of a song for about 15 seconds each.<br><br>Equipped with 5 types of repeat functions.<br><br>It is equipped with FL display.<br><br>Equipped with a remote control electric volume that can be used as a headphone volume.<br>The volume is motorized for sound quality, and the LED flashes during operation, making it easy to see from a distance.<br><br>Equipped with a timer standby mechanism.<br><br>Equipped with a synchro terminal, it can be linked with VICTOR/JVC&#39;s synchro compatible deck.<br><br>Equipped with auto-space function.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
