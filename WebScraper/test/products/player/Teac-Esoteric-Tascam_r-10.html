				<p class="detail">This SCMS compatible DAT deck inherits the functions and mechanism from the TASCAM brand professional DAT and the sound quality from the ESOTERIC brand DAT/R-1.<br><br>A 1-bit A/D converter is used.<br>This method converts an analog signal into a pulse wave and directly converts the width of the pulse wave into a digital signal. Furthermore, by using a fourth order noise shaving circuit, the noise in the audio signal pass band is shifted to a much higher frequency band. As a result, both low-level signals and small signals contained in high-level signals can be digitized with high linearity and fidelity to the original sound.<br>In principle, no 0 cross distortion occurs and no phase shift occurs.<br><br>The D/A converter uses an 8-times oversampling 18-bit digital filter.<br><br>In order to create a DAT system based on the recording and playback of the original sound, thick steel plates and side woods are used for the casing, and vibration control sheets are also attached to the top panel to eliminate resonance.<br>In addition, the mechanical part is housed in a U-shaped dedicated chassis and integrated with the base chassis to suppress the generation and propagation of vibration.<br>In addition, to avoid mutual interference, each block such as power supply, mechanical, display and signal converter is completely separated and laid out, and the internal chassis is shielded to eliminate mutual electrical and physical interference between each section and further increase the rigidity of the case.<br>In addition, a large insulator made of a high-density material combined with special ceramics, which has high internal loss and excellent vibration absorption, is used to construct a thorough vibration-free and interference-free construction.<br><br>The Sendust Patter Head is used for recording and reproducing digital signals on tape. It has high reliability, high output, and excellent durability.<br>To improve the overall sound quality, the circuit board is a double-sided board that realizes the shortest wiring distance. Audio parts such as a completely independent wound power transformer, an independent rectifier circuit, and a large-capacity capacitor are used to provide a high sound quality design.<br><br>The front part uses a gold panel of aluminum drawing material and has a simple layout of keys for basic functions and subcodes. The large keys provide reliable and reliable operation.<br>In addition, the large FL display panel and LED indicators on the control keys make it easy to check whether the product is operating or not even when operated from a remote location by remote control.<br><br>It is equipped with tape operation function using subcode.<br>Equipped with direct search, skip search, intro check, end search, blank search, 3 x queue, review function, 9 x search function (remote control), etc.<br><br>The input volume is a differential left-right interlocking type in which the other moves precisely in accordance with the rotation of the other.<br>You can adjust both LRs first and then turn one knob to control both LRs volume while maintaining the balance.<br>In addition to usability, the channel separation has been improved by more than 10 dB compared to the conventional volume.<br><br>The start ID that indicates the beginning of a song can be automatically recorded by detecting the level of the song to be recorded.<br>If you want to add a Start ID or change the position of a tape edit, you can use the Rehearse function to record a Start ID or Skip ID while listening to a recorded song.<br>Since the recording position is ± 0.15 seconds (in five frame units), the operation of playing after searching does not cause the head of the song to be chipped.<br>After editing, you can use the renumbering function to repeat the song number from the beginning of the tape.<br><br>Equipped with a large 17-segment digital peak meter with high visibility.<br>In addition, it is equipped with a dimmer function that can control the brightness of the display in 4 stages (it can be done by remote control).<br><br>Multi-functional wireless remote control included.</p>
