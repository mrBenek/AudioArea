				<p class="detail">A CD player developed by inheriting the technology of DCD-3300.<br><br>The pick-up section is equipped with a laser pick-up that employs a tracking error detection method using three beams originally launched Shinkai.<br>In this mechanism, a high-torque large Hall motor is adopted for the spindle motor, which realizes high-speed access of the optical head and structure resistant to external vibration.<br>In addition, a linear motor is used to move the pickup to enable high-speed access and improve track-following resolution. In addition, speed detection by a highly responsive and highly accurate potentiometer enables speedy music selection.<br>In addition, a self-aligning turntable mechanism is installed to eliminate tracking errors caused by slight errors in the center hole of the CD disk.<br><br>The D/A converter uses an independent W super linear converter for the left and right sides.<br>The W super linear converter combines a super linear converter that completely eliminates 0 cross distortion and a double D/A converter that eliminates the time difference between the left and right channels.<br>The Super Linear Converter is a technology used in all digital (PCM) sound recorders in our studio. Conversion errors are corrected by adjusting the external weighting current. By thoroughly eliminating 0 cross distortion, noise pollution at the time of small signals is eliminated, enabling high-precision D/A conversion.<br>In addition, by adopting a double D/A converter system in which the left and right channels are completely independent of the digital filter, we have achieved excellent separation while eliminating the left and right time difference.<br><br>The digital filter uses a 4 x oversampling digital filter.<br>The 4-times oversampling digital filter is a linear-phase FIR type filter that provides an output of 176.4 kHz, which is four times the standard sampling frequency of 44.1 kHz. This filter shifts unwanted high-frequency noise to a higher frequency range of 156.4 kHz or higher, separating the audio signal from high-frequency noise.<br><br>The power supply section is composed of five independent power supplies. They are supplied separately to digital signal processing, pick-up servo, display, D/A conversion, and audio circuits to eliminate interference between each circuit.<br>A high-quality audio-only capacitor is used as the power supply for the audio circuit.<br><br>Interference between circuits is reduced by separating the circuit board independently between the digital filter and the D/A converter.<br><br>The weight of the disc holder is approximately 1.5 times that of conventional ones, and the structure is strong against shaking and vibration.<br>The mechanical base is made of a new BMC (engineering polymer material) that combines ceramic with glass fiber, eliminating resonance that occurs in metal bases.<br>In addition, the length of the two shafts supporting the optical head is also changed, and two types of full floating springs are used. This is a non-resonance and vibration-proof design.<br><br>Uses a double-structured cabinet that covers the metal chassis with metal plates.<br><br>One coaxial type digital output is installed, and this output terminal can be turned ON/OFF.<br><br>Equipped with a time search function, you can enjoy playback from your favorite place by selecting minutes and seconds. With this function, you can return to that time every time you press the Play key. In addition, if you press the time search key in the middle of a song, the point in time is memorized, and each time you press the Play key, you can quickly replay from the memorized position.<br><br>It is equipped with a function to select 20 songs program for timer play.<br><br>15-item intelligent display has been adopted for the display part.<br>With this method, you can display the total number of songs and the total time regardless of the disc or program when the CD stops, display the track, index, and the elapsed time of the song while playing, display the remaining time of the song with the time mode key, display the total remaining time of the disc, and display the total remaining time of the program while playing the program.<br>Other than that, there is a next song number display, and you can check the number of remaining songs with the music calendar and the program order with the Call key.<br><br>Equipped with an auto space function that adjusts the silence between songs to approximately 4 seconds.<br><br>Repeat in track order or program order is possible.<br><br>It is equipped with index search, auto search and manual search.<br><br>It has a headphone port.<br>The volume of this terminal is also used as the lineout variable output.<br><br>Timer connection enables timer search and memory playback.<br><br>In order to cope with pre-emphasized CDs, a de-emphasis circuit using high-precision parts is adopted.<br><br>A wire rack remote controller is included.</p>
