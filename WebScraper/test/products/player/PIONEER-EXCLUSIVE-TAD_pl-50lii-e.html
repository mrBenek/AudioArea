				<p class="detail">A record player whose sound quality has been improved by reflecting the sound quality improvement technology obtained with a high-grade machine.<br><br>The tone arm employs a double-structure head-shell integrated straight arm composed of carbon graphite and high-rigidity aluminum base, which are lightweight, highly rigid and have excellent damping characteristics. While examining the material itself, the complex split-resonance phenomenon is eliminated by computer vibration analysis.<br>The strength of the head shell part and the connector part at the root is also sufficiently high to eliminate the adverse effect of resonance.<br><br>To eliminate low-frequency resonance and achieve high sensitivity at the same time, a variable level silicon oil braking system is adopted.<br>This is designed to apply damping by sinking a damping fin (ring shape) into the silicon oil injected into the oil cup at the upper part of the arm shaft. By appropriately matching the equivalent mass of various cartridges and the arm, the applicable range of the arm is expanded.<br>In addition, by cutting the tip of the fin at 45 degrees, the structure reduces the Q (resonance sharpness) of low-frequency resonance by applying appropriate braking simultaneously in both horizontal and vertical directions. In addition, cross-modulation distortion is greatly improved by the synergistic effect of mass concentration concentration system that brings the main weight of the arm closer to the rotating shaft.<br><br>The arm base uses a heavy weight die cast arm base with a stabilizing effect. By fixing the arm firmly and suppressing partial resonance, it realizes low-frequency reproduction with higher resolution.<br><br>In order to improve rotational accuracy, we have adopted a coreless structure that does not cause cogging in principle. In addition, we have achieved excellent rotational characteristics by adopting the SH rotor system in which the rotor fulcrum (bearing) located at the bottom of the motor is moved just below the turntable. The SH rotor system fundamentally eliminates the reverse conical motion of the motor shaft caused by the slight clearance between the motor shaft and the bearing, which could not be prevented by the conventional structure.<br>A coreless quartz PLL DC servo hole motor with a starting torque of 1.6kg-cm is used to eliminate the load fluctuation caused by the resistance which the needle tip receives from the recording sound groove, and a 330kg-cm ring motor is used to eliminate the load fluctuation.<sup>2</sup>By adopting a 31 cm diameter turntable with an inertial mass of 1 g, the stability that does not cause rotational speed fluctuation even under the load of 200g needle pressure is realized.<br>In addition, three Hall elements developed by Pioneer are used in the magnetic pole switching mechanism of the motor, and fine noise is eliminated by seeking processing accuracy in the order of microns even to other fine parts.<br><br>Equipped with a silent lift-up mechanism that does not produce mechanical sounds. This is a moving coil system that applies the operation principle of a speaker to the elevation mechanism that moves the arm up and down. It is designed to operate without contact with DC voltage.<br>In addition, the end position of the sound groove of the record is detected by non-contact detection using the Hall element inside the arm shaft and magnet, so that no side pressure is generated and the sensitivity of the arm is not impaired.<br>In addition, a pure electronic quick stop mechanism is adopted.<br><br>The cabinet uses a high-density cabinet (marble ebony finish) with laminated solid boards to effectively prevent the cabinet from shaking due to the reaction of the rotational moment of the high torque motor.<br>In addition, a unique low center of gravity insulator is used as the supporting insulator to ensure stability against external vibrations such as howling.<br><br>Oxygen-free copper wires with low transmission loss are used for the tone arm lead wires and PU cord.<br><br>Equipped with an S-shaped universal arm pipe (with large weight) that allows easy replacement of the head shell, any cartridge can be enjoyed by the twin pipe replacement system.<br>In addition, carbon graphite shell integrated straight arm pipe is also sold separately. Straight arms are arranged as many as the number of cartridges, and you can enjoy easily changing cartridges.</p>
