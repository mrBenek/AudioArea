				<p class="detail">Quick reverse deck equipped with dbx as noise reduction system.<br><br>As a noise reduction system, it is equipped with dbx NR in addition to conventional Dolby B/C NR.<br>With dbx, the level of the input signal is compressed to 1/2 for recording, and the level is expanded twice during playback. This method reduces the hissing inherent to tape by 30 to 40 dB and realizes a wide dynamic range.<br><br>BSP (Bi-directional Symmetrical Precision) mechanism is adopted for the mechanism part.<br>This mechanism is symmetrical in order to equalize the travel characteristics in both directions. Moreover, to stabilize the tape travel, the tape guide is made independent, and by installing a dual wide guide system with a wide tape contact surface, the disturbance of tape travel is reduced.<br><br>In order to prevent the azimuth deviation due to the rotation of the head, a rotary system is adopted. The same head gap and read / write amplifier are used for both directions. On top of this, an accurate reverse head system with high accuracy and high reliability has been completed.<br>High hardness zinc die-cast is used for the head housing part, solid lubricant with excellent abrasion resistance is used for the rotating part, and high hardness fine ceramics is used for the stopper part.<br><br>Twin Field Super GX head is adopted for the head part.<br>This head uses a single head housing with a recording head gap of 4 μ that can withstand deep bias current and a reproducing head gap of 1 μ that has good high-frequency characteristics. This achieves high performance equivalent to that of a 3-head.<br>In addition, 99.99% pure oxygen-free copper wire (OFC) is newly used for coil wire to improve sound quality.<br><br>The read / write amplifier is equipped with a ± 2 power source DC amplifier, and the Dolby block is independent of the amplifier block to avoid mutual influence.<br>The amplifier section uses a high-slew rate low-noise OP amplifier and newly developed Fold Back Electrode Transistor (FBET) to increase the speed of the line amplifier and reduce distortion. It also uses a high-speed tracking regulator to support the wide dynamic range of dbx.<br></p><br><hr>
            <p class="detail">It is equipped with RPPS which can perform operations such as random music selection and intro play.<br><br>The random selection mechanism allows you to program the songs you want to listen to in the order you want to listen to them.<br>If you program up to 30 programs out of 29 songs on the A side and B side of the tape, the computer automatically controls and starts playing in the ordered sequence.<br>Repeat playback is also available with this function.<br><br>The Sequential Intro Play function plays the intro part of a song for 10 seconds and fast-forwards it to the beginning of the next song. Since this operation is repeated one after another, the contents of the tape can be checked efficiently in a short period of time.<br><br>Program Intro Play allows you to combine random songs and play them in the programmed order.<br><br>You can freely set the intro time from 1 second to 29 seconds for each intro-play function.<br><br><br>Equipped with a computer search mechanism, it can perform blank skip play, REC cancel, IPLS, etc.<br>With Blank Skip Play, you can quickly find and play the next song when there is a long interval between songs, and with Rec Cancel, you can return to the recording start position with one touch and enter the recording standby mode.<br>IPLS is used to start the next song.<br></p><br><hr>
            <p class="detail">Equipped with an auto mute mechanism, you can automatically make a 4 second silent recording part.<br><br>Equipped with functions such as auto-play mechanism, auto-tape selector, timer start mechanism and MPX filter.<br><br>The volume is an electronic volume that is not affected by aging.<br><br>Equipped with a reverse selector that allows you to select the travel range of the tape.<br><br>Equipped with an output volume.<br><br>There are 2 color variations of black and silver.<br><br>Operation from a remote location is possible by using the separately sold remote control unit.</p>
