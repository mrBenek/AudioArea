				<p class="detail">CD player with Custom Edit.<br><br>The digital filter is a 4 x oversampling digital filter, and the D/A converter is equipped with a dual D/A converter.<br><br>The servo circuit is equipped with S Servo III.<br>In the S Servo III, the high-frequency noise component of the servo current is removed with a low-pass filter to supply a smooth servo current, which stabilizes the power supply from the power supply and prevents adverse effects on sound quality.<br><br>A digital CLV servo is installed in the drive system servo circuit that controls disk rotation.<br>The digital CLV servo detects the rotation of the spindle motor and controls it with 10-bit resolution to maintain an accurate linear velocity regardless of the disk&#39;s inner or outer circumference. It also detects the difference in inertial mass between the 12 cm CD and 8 cm CD disks to drive more appropriately.<br><br>Low noise and high stability are achieved by incorporating an RF amplifier in the pickup section.<br><br>The digital signal processing LSI uses the fourth generation LSI for the Sony CD player. Previously external RAM has been upgraded to a capacity of 32 kbit and built into the digital signal processing LSI. The precision of the signal processing capability is further enhanced by adopting the strict 6-fold error correction method.<br><br></p>

            <p class="detail">Equipped with a custom edit function, it has six functions : peak search, time edit, program edit, time fade, variable fade and manual fader.<br><br>In peak search, all songs are searched at high speed, and they are repeatedly played for about 4 seconds before and after the point where the volume level is highest.<br><br>Time Edit enables efficient editing of the A-side and B-side when recording tapes.<br>If you want to edit to fit the length of your tape, use the TIME SET button or AMS button to set the length of the tape (you can also use the direct key to set the length in seconds). Press the Edit button. First, program from the first song for side A. When you encounter a time-over song, select the longest song that fits within the time. Then press the Edit button to edit side B.<br>Also, if you select and edit a half disk with the AMS button, tracks are distributed so that the A side and B side of the tape are about the same length without changing the order of the songs.<br><br>Program Edit allows you to manually edit your favorite songs in any order.<br>With the AMS key or direct key, you can program your favorite songs in any order while checking the accumulated time. If you turn on Auto Space at this time, you can edit each song by adding a 3-second blank to the playing time. When you press the pause button, you can program the A side and then the B side together.<br><br>Time Fade allows you to fade out at a specified time, which can be set with the TIME SET button or the AMS button.<br><br>The manual fader allows you to fade in and fade out at the desired location, and the variable fade time can be set in increments of one second from 2 to 10 seconds.<br></p>
