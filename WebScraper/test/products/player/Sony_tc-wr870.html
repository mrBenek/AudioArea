				<p class="detail">Double quick reverse cassette deck in which Dolby NR B-C type is independently mounted on A/B deck.<br><br>Both A and B decks are equipped with a newly developed silent and quick action reverse mechanism that realizes quiet and smooth tape running performance.<br><br>It is equipped with a sound auto-focus function that automates the setting of recording level.<br>This function is different from simply setting the level with the meter automatically sets the recording level that takes advantage of the capabilities of the tape by sensing the type of tape, the presence of Dolby NR, and the level of the source, and analyzing the optimal value by the computer.<br><br>It is equipped with a cassette stabilizer. When the tape is set, the stabilizer installed inside the cassette door firmly fixes the cassette half and suppresses the vibration of the tape.<br><br>Based on Sony&#39;s original amorphous laser head using an amorphous magnetic alloy, we have adopted a PC-OCC wound laser amorphous head in which the head winding has been changed to a PC-OCC winding.<br><br>Equipped with Dolby HX Pro, the effective bias amount during recording is controlled to the optimum value in units of 1/1000 second to prevent over-bias in the high band and improve linearity in the high band.<br><br>By using a super-bias and greatly shifting up the bias frequency, the frequency difference with the music signal is expanded to improve the resolution and characteristics of the high-frequency range.<br><br>The B deck is equipped with bias fine tuning that can fine-tune the optimum bias values that vary slightly depending on the type of tape.<br><br>As a noise reduction system, it is equipped with Dolby NR B type and C type.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.<br>This remote control is also equipped with a wireless CD sync recording function that allows users to enjoy synchronized recording without connecting a sync cord to a Sony remote-controlled CD player.<br><br>It uses a linear electronic counter with FL tube that is equipped with a subtraction function of minute and second display.<br><br>It is equipped with a peak level meter with real time peak display and peak hold function.<br><br>Equipped with a display mode switch, you can switch between all lights and off from the remote control.<br><br>Equipped with an auto-fader function, you can fade in and fade out from the position where you press the auto-fade button.<br>In addition, you can also fade in by recording messages in conjunction with the timer.<br><br>Equipped with a quick reverse mechanism, it realizes quick operation with almost no sound cut when reversing the tape.<br><br>It uses a twin recording re-reverse mechanism that enables simultaneous recording of two tapes and continuous recording of 180 minutes.<br><br>Equipped with AMS (Automatic Music Sensor) function that can quickly cue the beginning of the previous or next music.<br><br>It is equipped with a blank skip function, and when there is a silent part of more than 10 seconds, it fast-forwards to the beginning of the next song and restarts the performance.<br><br>Equipped with auto pause function.<br>With this function, when dubbing at normal speed, the A deck is put into a pause state every time a song is played, and the B deck waits in a recording pause. This enables synchronized dubbing while selecting a song.<br><br>Equipped with an auto tape selector, it automatically detects type I (normal), II (high position), or IV (metal).<br><br>Equipped with an autoplay function that automatically starts playing after rewinding, and a memory play function that starts playing from the position reset to counter 0.<br><br>By combining the timer sold separately, it is possible to record your absence and play the alarm clock.<br><br>Equipped with an autospace Rec Mute function that automatically records muting for approximately 4 seconds by pressing a button and temporarily stops it.<br><br>It is equipped with a power loading function. When you put a tape in the cassette lid and press the operation button such as play or rewind without closing the door, the tape is automatically loaded and the operation mode is entered.<br>This series of operations also works when using the remote control.<br><br>It is equipped with a dubbing level control function to keep sound quality when editing tapes.<br>The signal level during dubbing can be adjusted to the optimum level of the recording side tape.<br><br>Equipped with a headphone port with volume.<br><br>Aluminum front panel is adopted.</p>
