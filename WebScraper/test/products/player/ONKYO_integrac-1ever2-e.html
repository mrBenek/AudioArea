				<p class="detail">Based on the C-1E of the Quest Integra series, this is a CD player the basic operation of the circuit and introduced high-sound quality parts.<br><br>The D/A converter has been developed and equipped with FPCS (Fine Pulse Conversion System) based on ONKYO custom digital filter SM5843AP.<br>This FPCS configuration uses SM5843AP and two Philips SAA7350 and TDA1547 independently on the left and right. It uses the upsampling function that generates the 8 fs signal of SAA7350 to 192 fs. It is input to the D/A converter TDA1547 independent on the left and right through the data interface circuit, and realizes high-quality D/A conversion.<br>In addition, in order to obtain a more accurate signal, it is equipped with a digital filter capable of smooth interpolation equal to twice the sampling frequency.<br><br>The master clock for high-precision D/A conversion uses the AccuPulseQuartz method, in which a rod-shaped crystal oscillator with strong vibration is mounted on a polysorb cushion with excellent vibration control.<br><br>In order to prevent adverse effects caused by noise in digital signal systems and mechanical systems, the power supply consisting of a LASER transformer with ultra-low leakage flux and a blue condenser is mounted independently on the analog and digital systems. In addition, the power supply is divided into seven systems : two analog systems, two D/A conversion systems, one digital system, one mechanical system, and one muting system. This eliminates noise and interference from the power supply.<br>In addition, a static lighting system using LED is adopted for the display section to prevent contamination of the music signal due to noise from the display section.<br>In addition, the muting and emphasis signals are separated by a photo-isolator to prevent interference from the digital signal processing section to the analog section.<br><br>The front panel part is 9 mm thick, highly rigid, non-magnetic all-aluminum monocoque chassis is used.<br>This chassis is finished to an accuracy of ± 0.5 mm by high-precision machining technology. By providing many ribs on the inside and outside, the rigidity of the chassis is improved and unnecessary resonance is reduced.<br>The insulator is made of DuPont Corian, which has rigidity and vibration damping properties, to ensure non-resonance and high rigidity.<br><br>As for the mechanical part, an open-top mechanism with less unnecessary vibration such as a tray is used in the center arrangement, and an insulator with multiple resonance frequencies is fixed to the chassis in order to suppress the effect of vibration.<br>In addition, the weight chucking method, which also serves as a disk stabilizer for brass shaving, realizes an appropriate weight balance and enables error-free reading.<br><br>Digital signal processing, D/A conversion section, and analog processing section are arranged around the center mechanism, and the construction emphasizes the flow of signals.<br><br>The power supply unit uses a blue capacitor No. 923, which was developed over a period of three years, and high-quality parts such as Radarstein film cones.<br><br>For the PIN terminal, a highly rigid brass machined gold plated terminal is used. When it is mounted on the rear panel, one pair of left and right is fixed rigidly with two points.<br>The left and right terminals are separated by 18 mm to enable the use of PIN plugs.<br><br>An optical digital out terminal with an ON/OFF switch is mounted. When not in use, digital noise can be reduced by turning it OFF.</p>
