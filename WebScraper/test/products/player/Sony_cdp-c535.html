				<p class="detail">A roulette type CD player equipped with a disk exchange mechanism.<br><br>The tray uses a roulette system that can hold 5 CDs.<br>It also includes a disk exchange feature that lets you view and replace non-playing disks and load CDs into empty trays.<br><br>The D/A converter is equipped with a newly developed hybrid pulse D/A converter that uses Sony&#39;s unique noise-shaping method.<br>This circuit improves the signal-to-noise ratio by incorporating a noise-shaping digital filter that performs high-precision oversampling operation in the D/A converter itself. At the same time, the signal path is simplified by using a single chip, and signal degradation due to jitter is minimized by improving the function of the direct digital sink formed on the same chip.<br><br>It is equipped with a direct digital sink and the master clock is formed on the same chip as the pulse D/A converter. This allows the electronic switch of the pulse D/A converter to be turned on and off more accurately, eliminating harmful jitter and reducing sound quality degradation.<br><br>The servo circuit uses a high-precision digital servo.<br>In this circuit, the signal from the optical pickup is A/D converted, filtered and controlled by digital processing, and then D/A converted again to operate the optical pickup, making it possible to adjust the servo amount according to each disc.<br>The high-precision servo uses a high-sampling rate, high-precision, high-resolution A/D converter and D/A converter to realize a more ideal servocontrol and low power consumption by digitizing.<br><br></p>

            <p class="detail">It has a custom edit function and eight functions : peak search, time edit, link edit, program edit, multi-disk program, time fade, variable fade, and manual fader.<br><br>In peak search, all songs are searched at high speed, and they are repeatedly played for about 4 seconds before and after the point where the volume level is highest.<br><br>Time Edit enables efficient editing of the A-side and B-side when recording tapes.<br>First, use the TIME SET or AMS button to set the length of the tape (you can also use the direct key to set the length in seconds) and press the Edit button. Then, program the A side starting with the first track. When you hit a time-over track, you select the longest track that fits in time. Then press the Edit button to edit the B side as well.<br>Also, if you select and edit a half disk with the AMS button, tracks are distributed so that the A side and B side of the tape are about the same length without changing the order of the songs.<br><br>Link Edit is used when a large number of tapes are left over during Time Edit or Just Edit. The track number of the song to be included in the remaining time and the LINK display blink, and you can add a song by selecting from the blinking track number again.<br>Link-edit also allows you to swap disks and continue the edit.<br><br>Program Edit allows you to manually edit your favorite songs in any order.<br>Use the AMS key or direct key to program your favorite songs in the desired order while checking the accumulated time. Press the pause button to program the A side and then the B side together.<br><br>Multi-disk programs allow editing across multiple disks. You can program songs up to 32 steps and only on disks in the changer.<br><br>Time Fade allows you to fade out at a specified time, which can be set with the TIME SET button or the AMS button.<br><br>You can set the fade-in / fade-out time for the variable fade from 2 seconds to 10 seconds in units of 1 second.<br><br>The manual fader allows you to fade in and fade out at the desired location.<br><br></p>

            <p class="detail">Equipped with DSP (Digital Signal Processing) function, it is possible to add reflected sound and reverberation sound which produce surround effect by digital signal processing to music signal and play it back. There are 5 types of sound field space set.<br>The DSP function does not work with optical digital output.<br><br>With the built-in Music Scan function, you can play only the beginning part of a song one after another. You can choose from three performances : 10 seconds, 20 seconds and 30 seconds. All of them come with a 2-second fade-out function. If you don&#39;t want to listen to a song while scanning, you can delete it with the clear button.<br><br>It is equipped with functions such as a program performance function that can set up to 32 songs across 5 disks, 7-mode repeat of 1 song, all songs on 1 disk, all songs on all disks, all disk programs, one disk shuffle, all disk shuffle, and select disk shuffle, AMS that can quickly start a song, and music search that enables fast forward / backward playback while listening to a song.<br><br>The display has a 5-disc + 20-track music calendar.<br><br>Equipped with an optical digital output.<br><br>Equipped with two line outputs, fixed and variable.<br>In addition, it is equipped with a headphone terminal with a lineout linked volume that flashes when the remote control is operated.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
