				<p class="detail">A CD player with a new disc stabilizer.<br><br>In order to prevent the slight vibration of the disc itself, which adversely affects the performance, the material and shape have been improved, and a new disc stabilizer with newly developed special resin has been adopted on the surface of the material.<br>In addition, by using a ball-aligning disk stabilizer composed of four ball bearings, the rotational axis of the disk stabilizer is automatically aligned with the rotational axis of the disk table. This eliminates the misalignment of the rotational axis while maintaining the necessary play of the disk stabilizer.<br><br>A linear servo system has been adopted to further improve the basic characteristics of the pickup, eliminate unnecessary resonance and crosstalk of the actuator, and prevent sound skipping by appropriate servo characteristics and gain control.<br><br>A newly developed small-size pickup is used for the pickup part.<br>It uses a new type actuator and has a structure in which the lens base, which is measured while ensuring sufficient secondary moment of section, is supported by a beryllium copper spring with a special hardened surface.<br>This spring has a waveform shape that takes into consideration the vibration dynamics. It efficiently drives the center of gravity of the movable part with a simple magnetic circuit and follows the pit together with the servo circuit.<br>In addition, the magnetic circuit is supported by a base with high internal loss, making it resistant to external vibration.<br>In order to achieve sufficient rigidity and compact shape, the body is box-shaped and thin-walled precision aluminum die-cast is used.<br><br>A pure transmission system has been adopted in pursuit of high-purity transmission.<br>The digital part reduces unnecessary vibration of the disk due to the disk stabilizer and eliminates the adverse effect of external noise on the digital signal.<br>In the audio section, a low-noise low-output impedance regulator is placed close to the audio circuit on the PCB to supply each block circuit with reduced impedance rise.<br>In addition, the use of IC common to L and R is eliminated, and L and R symmetrical straight pattern is adopted.<br><br>High rigidity is achieved by incorporating honeycomb ribs in the chassis.<br>In addition, in order to protect the optical system mechanism from external vibration, the center of gravity is designed to be lower than the support part of the mechanism.<br>As a result, unstable lateral vibration is reduced and more stable signal reading is possible.<br><br>It has a 6-digit display that shows the performance status, track number and elapsed time.<br><br>You can play 24 songs in a program. It also has a repeat function for all songs / programs / one song.<br><br>Equipped with track search and 3-speed manual search.<br><br>When the power is turned on, it automatically plays from the first track without pressing the play button.<br><br>Reinforcement ribs are used on the hood.<br><br>Equipped with a subcode output terminal and headphone terminal.</p>
