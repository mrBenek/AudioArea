				<p class="detail">A three head cassette deck with a dual capstan drive and a REC/PB combination head.<br><br>A dual capstan drive is used for the driving mechanism.<br>The dual capstan drive is designed to be driven by two sets of capstan on the supply side and take-up side and a pinch roller. This structure ensures stable rotational accuracy at all times. In addition, the rubber flat belt that transmits the rotation of the motor to the fly-wheel extends slightly, so that the take-up flywheel rotates slightly faster than the supply side, and appropriate tension is applied between the two capstan to improve head touch. In addition, since the tape span is as short as 48 mm, the vibration of the tape can be pushed out of audible frequency and modulation noise is reduced.<br><br>Uses a motor with FG (Frequency Generator).<br>In this motor, a signal proportional to the number of revolutions is detected at a frequency. This signal is compared with a reference signal, and the number of revolutions is controlled so that the difference of the number of revolutions error component becomes 0. As a result, various characteristics such as constant speed characteristics, temperature characteristics and drift are improved.<br><br>The head uses a combination ferrite head with a recording head and a reproducing head in one case. The gap between the recording head and the reproducing head is set to approximately 4 μ m for recording and approximately 1 μ m for reproducing, thus achieving excellent recording and reproducing characteristics.<br>This combination head is fully shielded against magnetic flux leakage, and is processed with precision to the micron level to prevent contour effects in the low frequency range during playback.<br><br>Equipped with a dedicated microphone amplifier of independent 2 power supply system.<br>In addition, mixing operation is possible by Mic/Line independent volume with L/R double friction volume.<br><br>Low distortion rate and high dynamic range ICs are used in circuits for playback, recording, and line meters to improve reliability and performance.<br><br>You can switch between the equalizer 2 position (LH/CrO2) and the bias 2 position (LH/CrO2) with the front panel push switch.<br><br>Equipped with a bias adjuster mechanism that is continuously variable to ± 15%.<br>In addition, it is equipped with a bias adjustment mechanism using a calibration signal and a combination head. The bias adjustment mechanism uses a calibration signal and the vicinity of 300 Hz, which is the main component of the calibration signal, to adjust the Rec Level ADJ volume so that the level meter indicates the same memory while the monitor switch is alternately switched with the tape-source. In addition, the BIAS ADJ volume is adjusted so that the sound quality of the high-frequency components of the source sound and the tape sound are the closest.<br><br>A built-in calibration signal generator is provided for calibration during recording.<br>This is a calibration signal that uses pink noise and contains a signal close to normal music, allowing you to calibrate various deck recording levels.<br><br>Using a real-time recording and playback system with a combination head, it is possible to obtain an echo effect by changing the level of the signal that has once been recorded and played back to the recording system and feeding it back.<br>This echo effect takes 70 ms for the 4.75/sec tape to pass through the 3.4 mm gap of the combination recorder re-head.<br>The amount of echo effect can be continuously varied depending on the volume of the panel surface.<br><br>Equipped with Dolby NR as noise reduction system.<br>The K-2 features a double-Dolby configuration. By using highly reliable ICs for both encoding and decoding, Dolby can be used for simultaneous recording and playback. In addition, the K-2 is equipped with an MPX filter that operates in conjunction with Dolby NR to prevent malfunction of the Dolby circuit when recording from the tuner.<br>Dolby When the circuit is OFF, the filter is also OFF, enabling further broadband recording and playback.<br><br>The power supply section uses a ± 2 stabilized power supply.<br><br>Equipped with an auto-stop mechanism that electronically detects the tape end and does not burden the mechanism.<br>The rotation detection part is a non-contact detection part using multi-pole ring magnet and Hall IC, and a 10-PIN IC is used for the shut-off circuit.<br><br>Equipped with timer recording mechanism, it is possible to record absence by using the timer sold separately.<br>Since the mechanism uses a solenoid, there is no burden on the drive system mechanism except when the tape is running, and there is no concern about tape elongation or pinch roller deformation.<br><br>Equipped with a large level meter.<br><br>It is equipped with a headphone terminal that can be used for low-efficiency high-impedance headphones.<br><br>The transparent part of the housing door is large so that you can see the type of tape and the running condition. In addition, it can be removed for ease of cleaning the head.<br><br>Uses a soft eject mechanism that employs a gear-type soft damper.</p>
