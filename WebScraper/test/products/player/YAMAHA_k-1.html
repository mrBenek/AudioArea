				<p class="detail">This stereo cassette deck pursues sound quality and functions.<br><br>The head uses Triple-P-Head (Pure &amp; Plasma Process Head) made of Sendust (alloy of iron, silicon and aluminum).<br>The name &quot;Pure&quot; is derived from the fact that the process has been simplified by the plasma spraying method and is highly accurate.<br>The magnetic properties of SENDUST are superior to those of permalloy and ferrite. Moreover, the hardness of SENDUST, which is one of the disadvantages of permalloy, is equivalent to that of ferrite, and SENDUST is superior in terms of noise characteristics, mechanical defects, and temperature characteristics, which are disadvantages of ferrite. However, the practical application of SENDUST has been delayed due to the difficulty in processing and cost.<br>To overcome this problem, Yamaha uses a technology called the high vacuum centrifugal casting method, in which a high purity material of 99.999999 to 99.9% is contained in 10%.<sup>-5</sup>High-purity Sendust is melted in a high vacuum of torr, and poured into a high-speed rotating ceramic mold set in the same capsule for casting. High-purity Sendust with excellent unidirectional crystals is used as a core material with the desired shape.<br>In addition, the plasma spraying method has been introduced, in which the Sendust core is assembled as a head and placed in a permalloy shield case. The front face of the head is covered with thick Sendust by radiating a plasma of Sendust, which is the same as the core material, on the front face of the head, and the mirror finishing is done after that.<br>The head completed by these methods is covered with Sendust on the whole surface to which the tape touches, and there is no one sided loss, and adhesion of dust and dirt is reduced.<br>Triple-P-Head has the following characteristics : high core permeability, good reproduction efficiency and high sensitivity, high saturation magnetic flux density, high signal current, good linearity even at large input, and little distortion. Low magnetic distortion, low sliding noise, good S / N ratio, high Curie point, stable temperature characteristics, and high hardness, excellent wear resistance.<br>In addition, the head has a shape with less contour effect.<br><br>A separate drive 2-motor mechanism is adopted for the mechanism part, and an FG servo motor is used for capstan drive and a DC high torque motor is used for reel drive.<br>Unlike the system in which the capstan motor also drives the take-up reel during PLAY, the capstan motor has a simple configuration in which only the capstan drive is performed, thereby eliminating the disturbance factor in the mechanism system that deteriorates the rotational accuracy of the capstan.<br><br>The FG servo motor used to drive the capstan is a high-torque DC motor that uses an FG servo circuit. The change in tape speed, which tends to fluctuate at the beginning and end of tape winding, is very small, and the modulation distortion caused by wow flutter is also sufficiently suppressed.<br><br>The reel motor for tape winding uses a DC motor that rotates in both directions with a starting torque of 60g ・ cm. The direction of rotation is reversed for fast forward and rewind. The rotation speed during FF and REW is approximately 2000 rpm, but during PLAY it is reduced to approximately 1000 rpm by voltage control to improve the wow by reducing the rotational sound and vibration of tape winding.<br><br>The capstan has a roundness error of 0.1 microns or less, and has a precision finish of micron order of clearance with the bearing. The flywheel is 77 mm φ and has a high precision of less than 6 μ m of eccentric center distance. Moreover, the inertia energy of 1700g ・ cm enables smooth rotation of the capstan.<br>The flat belt for power transmission has a very small expansion and contraction, a wide crimping area, and the crimping surface is polished by special technology to a state close to mirror surface.<br>The chassis to which the running system is mounted is precisely finished with 1.6 mm thick iron plate.<br><br>The equalizer amplifier has a 4-chip configuration using a low-noise FET at the first stage and is driven by 2 power supplies of ± 15 v.<br>By adopting a low-noise FET in the first stage, the input circuit capacitor can be omitted. Since the output of the head is directly connected to the gate of the FET, there is no adverse effect of the capacitor. Moreover, the dispersion of the low-frequency phase and the noise in the ultra-low-frequency range are sufficiently suppressed.<br>When recording, this equalizer amplifier operates as a microphone amplifier by switching the equalizer element of the NF circuit.<br><br>Equipped with a sound focus switch, you can choose between the SHARP position that emphasizes frequency characteristics and the SOFT position that emphasizes phase characteristics.<br>In normal cassette decks, a resonance capacitor for high-frequency peaking is inserted in parallel with the head in order to compensate for the loss of the head in the high-frequency range during playback. In the SHARP position, a resonance capacitor is inserted as in the past to emphasize the frequency characteristics. In the SOFT position, the frequency characteristics are reduced by 1-3dB in the high-frequency range, but the phase characteristics are stable during playback.<br>In the SOFT position, the frequency at which the phase is reversed in the high range becomes a considerably high frequency outside the audible band, so the localization is improved by vocal playback, etc.<br><br>The bias oscillator circuit has a small distortion of the oscillation waveform and a sufficiently large oscillation output, and the bias frequency is set high at 105 kHz.<br><br>The erasing head uses a double-gap ferrite head with high erasing efficiency of 60 dB or more (1 kHz).<br><br>It has a simple design in which frequently used operation buttons and knobs other than recording level volume and playback level volume are placed inside the sealing panel.<br>All deck operations are controlled by Yamaha IC logic control.<br><br>It uses highly integrated logic IC and IC logic control by solenoid plunger. The time from pressing the operation button to operation is very short, and moreover, direct change from mode to mode is possible.<br><br>Equipped with a REC ST BY button corresponding to the conventional recording pose, you can set the deck recording pose with one touch.<br><br>Equipped with auto-stop mechanism.<br>Since the K-1 uses a 12-pole ring magnet and a Hall element for the rotation detector, it takes less than one second from when the tape stops running to when it starts running.<br><br>Equipped with a REC MUTE switch. While the switch is pressed, the red LED lights up and you can record without any signal.<br><br>It has a soft eject mechanism. Regardless of the mode of the mechanism, if the EJECT button is pressed, it automatically stops and the cassette can be taken out. When the door is opened, the mechanism does not operate even if the operation button is pressed.<br><br>Equipped with a wide-range bar graph peak meter using a fluorescent display tube.<br>This meter is driven by a coda driver with a comparator of 24-pin IC, and displays -30dB to + 2 dB divided into 12. It is equipped with a recovery time selector switch, and the return time from 0 dB to -30dB can be switched between two stages of FAST (1.5 seconds) and SLOW (3.5 seconds).<br><br>Equipped with a 3-position tape selector that allows simultaneous switching of recording bias and playback equalizer.<br><br>It is equipped with a ± 8% variable bias adjuster that can adjust the bias amount set by the tape selector at a finer level to fit the characteristics of various tapes.<br>This adjuster comes with a center click for easy normal position.<br><br>Equipped with Dolby NR as a noise reduction system, it is possible to improve tape hiss and high-frequency noise.<br>Also, the green インンジケーター (LED) lights up during Dolby NR operation.<br><br>The built-in MPX filter prevents the Dolby circuit from malfunctioning due to a signal of 19 kHz or higher when recording from a tuner with a lot of carrier leakage.<br><br>Equipped with a subsonic filter.<br><br>Equipped with a timer recording mechanism, it is possible to record absence by combining with an optional timer.<br>Since the recording standby is performed electrically, there is no burden on the deck mechanism or tape.<br><br>The headphone amplifier uses an OTL circuit using a dedicated IC, and is compatible with headphones of 8 Ω to several k Ω.<br><br>It is equipped with a memory rewind function. When a tape is set and the tape counter is adjusted to 0 at the head where you want to listen, the tape stops automatically at counter 999.<br><br>It uses a slide-type recording level volume that can change both left and right channels simultaneously.<br>In addition, a REC BALANCE volume is provided when there is an imbalance between the left and right, such as when recording with a microphone.<br><br>There are 2 color variations, K-1 with silver finish and K-1B with black finish.</p>
