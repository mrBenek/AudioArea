				<p class="detail">A stereo cassette deck with no vibration and no resonance by making full use of advanced analysis technology, and with high sound quality by introducing Pioneer&#39;s original technology.<br><br>The NEW Z mechanism has been adopted to improve tape tension fluctuation, tape meander, and running speed fluctuation.<br>First of all, in order to obtain stable tape tension and head touch, we have adopted a resonance dispersion type closed loop dual capstan system in which left and right capstan and pinch roller are used as different diameter.<br>We have also succeeded in reducing head vibration and improving tape running by mounting a head block with a zinc die-cast double structure, in which tilt / height adjustment is precisely performed by an optical jig so that the head can be matched without opposing the natural flow of the tape.<br>In addition, it employs a capstan shaft with sub-micron order polishing accuracy and FS treatment (special processing technology that makes it difficult to slip without losing roundness of 0.1 μ m or less) on the tape running surface, and a balanced flywheel with a large moment of inertia. This reduces the slippage of the tape and shaft and enables stable tape running with less uneven speed.<br><br>The recording and reproducing heads employ a laser amorphous head that uses PC-OCC (single-crystal high-purity oxygen-free copper) for coil winding.<br>In addition, a double-gap ferrite head with a sendust guard is used for the erasing head.<br><br>Nastran (NASA Structure Analysis Program) developed by NASA is used to analyze vibration of the cassette half in order to eliminate vibration of the cassette half. Based on the results of the analysis, we are refining our vibration-free and resonance-free design.<br>In order to prevent resonance that occurs at specific parts of the half, it is equipped with special non-repulsion rubber and NEW cassette stabilizer that is effectively damped at high rigidity parts.<br>In addition, it is equipped with a Motor Vibration Insulator (M ・ V ・ I) mechanism to prevent vibration caused by the motor. Between the motor and the mechanical chassis, there is a special reinforced resin motor bracket with air bubbles inside. Between the motor bracket and the mechanical chassis, there is also a grounded insulator made of non-resilient rubber between the motor bracket and the mechanical chassis. Thus, vibration energy generated by the motor is effectively absorbed in terms of both structure and material.<br>In addition, in order to prevent vibration caused by sound pressure from speakers from being transmitted to the half, the door and cassette pocket are physically separated and equipped with an isorated door.<br><br>The deck itself is also completely vibration-free and resonance-free. Honeycomb structures with excellent vibration damping, such as copper-plated honeycomb chassis, large honeycomb insulator, and honeycomb shield case, are used in each part to diffuse vibration in various directions and attenuate it.<br><br>The bias oscillation frequency quality sound recording, the bias oscillation frequency has been increased to 210 kHz, which is twice the conventional frequency.<br>By setting the frequency difference with the music signal to a large value, the generation of beat and intermodulation noise due to interference between harmonics and bias current is suppressed, enabling recording with less distortion.<br><br>A direct construction design is provided so that the power supply, control, amplifier, mechanical and FL meter can be connected at the shortest distance. In addition, the volume is placed close to the input terminal and controlled by the shaft to minimize the wiring distance.<br>In the case of a source that does not require balance adjustment with the line-straighter function, the signal is routed to the recording amplifier at the shortest distance by bypassing the balance volume.<br><br>For each block of amplifier, control and FL indication, the transformer winding consists of four independent windings for exclusive power supply.<br>In particular, a bifilar winding made of oxygen-free copper wire is adopted for the transformer winding of the amplifier system, which improves the balance between + and - power supply and contributes to improved sound quality.<br><br>It is equipped with peak level calibration which microcomputer assists for accurate recording level setting.<br>Once you hold the peak level of the recording source, the held peak level moves on the meter according to the increase or decrease of the recording volume so that it can be adjusted to the appropriate level.<br><br>To get the most out of the characteristics of your tape, it is equipped with a bias level and recording level calibration function. It has a built-in oscillator for quick and accurate adjustment.<br><br>The CD-DECK is synchronized with a Pioneer CD player. You can enjoy editing and recording with auto-linked operation such as synchronized recording start with one touch or auto trackback recording.<br><br>Equipped with a meter range switching function, it is possible to switch between the wide range mode of -30dB to + 8 dB in normal operation and the expanded range mode of -3dB to + 12 dB which displays around 0 dB in 1 dB steps.<br><br>In order to suppress noise generation from the FL part, the FL display OFF function is installed. The display can be turned off when there is no FL display such as after setting the recording level or during playback.<br><br>Equipped with a normal tape counter, a time counter that displays the elapsed time of recording and playback, and a リメインカウンター 3-mode tape counter that displays the remaining time of the tape.<br><br>Equipped with a one touch Tape Return &amp; Return Play function that returns the tape to the counter 0000 with one touch and starts playback automatically after rewinding.<br><br>It is equipped with auto REC mute which can make 4 seconds silence part with one touch.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
