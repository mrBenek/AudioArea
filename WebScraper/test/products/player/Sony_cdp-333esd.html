				<p class="detail">A CD player developed by inheriting the design policy of CDP-555ESD.<br><br>The digital filter uses a 4 x oversampling digital filter.<br>Before the D/A conversion, this digital filter over-samples the digital signal to a sampling frequency of 176.4 kHz, which is four times the sampling frequency, to eliminate the frequency lower limit of unwanted components from 24.1 kHz to 156.4 kHz. This makes it possible to make the attenuation characteristics of the low-pass filter after the D/A conversion extremely smooth, significantly improve the group delay characteristics, and improve waveform reproducibility. In addition, the filter has a simple structure with fewer stages and fewer elements, so the deterioration of sound quality due to components can be minimized.<br><br>It is equipped with a unilinear converter system using 3rd generation LSI newly developed exclusively for CDs.<br>This is a digital signal processing system in which a D/A converter, digital filter, and EFM demodulator are completely synchronized with a single master clock. In principle, this system eliminates beat generation due to clock interference.<br>In addition, the third generation LSI, which reduces the number of peripheral parts by half by increasing the degree of integration, is used in the LSI group constituting this system, contributing to the improvement of accuracy and reliability of digital systems as well as the reduction of power consumption.<br><br>Equipped with a digital processing soft muting function.<br>With this function, clicking noise is prevented by muting instantaneously at the time of performance stop or pose operation. This processing is done by digital circuit to prevent sound quality degradation.<br><br>The D/A converter has an IC for the D/A converter with excellent linearity for the left and right channels independently. This eliminates the phase difference between the channels and ensures excellent sound localization.<br>The newly developed IC is a high-speed type that corresponds to the signal processing speed of the digital filter. It reduces the 0 cross distortion at the minute signal level and strictly eliminates the jitter component from the converter output. This eliminates not only the L/R switching circuit but also the sample-and-hold circuit, which was indispensable in the past, and makes the audio circuit extremely simple.<br><br>The low-pass filter uses a third active filter that reduces sound quality degradation, and the all-stage L/R twin-mono configuration eliminates channel interference.<br><br>The parts used have been carefully examined for sound quality.<br>In addition to high-sound operational amplifiers, copper-heat sinks, and screws, high-sound condensers, gold-plated terminals, and oxygen-free copper power cords with polarity display are used.<br><br>The power supply circuit uses 9 independent stabilized power supplies.<br>In addition to separating the digital and analog circuits, the power supply for the digital filter and the D/A converter has been dedicated, and the display and other devices have been separated Route 3 to eliminate voltage drops caused by disturbance of the servo power supply and interference with analog circuits such as harmonics of the digital signal.<br>In addition, the capacitors used in power transformers and rectifier circuits are large and have a large capacity that far exceeds the required capacity.<br><br>The base unit, which is the base of the optical system mechanism, uses a black cemented base unit.<br>This is a composite molding of metal and special resin containing ceramic powder with extremely high internal loss. The resonance sharpness is greatly reduced and the rigidity is also increased to completely suppress the generation of vibration. The entire base unit has a floating structure to block the transmission of vibration from the outside.<br>In addition, the chucking arm that secures the disk to the spindle has a double structure of resin and metal, and aerodynamic measures are also taken to prevent surface wobbling when the disk rotates.<br><br>The chassis consists of an external chassis and an internal chassis to ensure high strength and rigidity.<br>In addition, the mechanical block part, digital, analog part and control system are separately arranged to eliminate interference and resonance of each part as much as possible. In addition, a special large insulator made of non-resilient rubber and resin is used for the leg part to eliminate vibration transmission from the outside.<br><br>The servo circuit is equipped with S servo, a newly developed predictive control method.<br>The operating principle of S servo is that when a newly developed RFIC detects signal dropouts caused by scratches or dirt, a microcomputer calculates from the disk rotation cycle to predict when the next dropout will occur, and controls the servo amount of both tracking and focus servo circuits just before the dropout occurs to minimize the occurrence of errors.<br>The predicted time accuracy of the S servo is as high as 1/8,000 second. In addition, it is compatible with CLV (constant linear velocity) and maintains this accuracy at any position inside or around the disk. This improves the tracing capability compared to the conventional method in which the servo amount is controlled after the drop-out occurs. In addition, since the disturbance of the servo current is greatly reduced, the influence on the analog system generated through the power supply is also reduced.<br><br>High-speed linear motor tracking mechanism is adopted for the mechanism part.<br>In this mechanism, a linear motor is integrated into the optical block, enabling high-speed access with less than one second in the selection time from the first song to the start of the final song. In addition, reliability and durability are greatly improved because there is no transmission mechanism such as gears.<br><br>A latched digital output is used for the digital output section.<br>In addition to the use of an isolation pulse transformer, the analog output is cut during digital output and the digital output is cut during analog output to prevent mutual interference.<br>The output terminal of CDP 333 esd is designed to output subcode information as well.<br><br>Equipped with a centralized display, you can check the time and performance information in various ways.<br>In addition, it is equipped with Sony original music calendar, and the track number of the recorded music can be directly displayed up to 20 songs.<br><br>One touch direct music selection with 20 keys is possible.<br><br>It is equipped with an RMS function that can program up to 20 songs. This RMS function can add or change programs while playing.<br><br>Equipped with 5-mode repeat function of 1 track / ALL/A-B (between parts) / program / shuffle.<br>In 4 modes except A-B, the repeat count can be specified up to 9 times.<br><br>Features such as shuffle play, index search, AMS (, AMS (automatic music sensor) and music search.<br><br>Equipped with an auto-pause function that automatically enters a pause state at the end of each song.<br><br>Equipped with an auto space function that automatically sets the interval between songs to 3 seconds.<br>The auto space function is always activated when the program is played back.<br><br>Equipped with timer switch, alarm clock playback is also possible by using separately sold timer.<br><br>Equipped with a headphone port with volume.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
