				<p class="detail">A record player that thoroughly pursues the basic performance of the player.<br><br>A belt drive drive system has been adopted to obtain stable rotation.<br>Because it has a simple mechanism of direct drive by motor, friction is not generated compared to the one with complicated mechanism, and failure is minimized.<br><br>The turntable uses a double turntable system to increase inertial mass and reduce overall weight.<br>The outer side is made of 2.5 kg zinc die-cast, and the inner side is made of 0.5 kg aluminum die-cast. The weight is concentrated as much as possible on the peripheral part. The inner turntable is used as a belt drive to maximize the flywheel effect.<br><br>The double suspension system uses a capacitor-activated 4-pole synchronous type motor that maintains constant speed rotation without being affected by changes in voltage or load. This improves SN.<br><br>The belt uses a high-precision grinder finish polyurethane belt, and the thickness unevenness is made uniform to the value of the micron order. It is very stable and at the same time resistant to temperature change, and aging deterioration is minimized.<br><br>The part where the bearing fits to the center spindle is laminated with gunmetal and finished with complete wrapping.<br>As a result, the pressurization of the pivot part is minimized, so there is no worry of abrasion in spite of using a heavy turntable.<br>In addition, a special resin that is strong against metal is used for the joint part, and an oil reservoir of special design is provided.<br><br>About 110 mm stainless steel is used for the center spindle.<br><br>When the power switch is OFF, the speed switching mechanism is automatically interlocked to prevent deformation of the belt.<br>In addition, since it drives inside the double turntable, it is easy to change the belt.<br><br>It uses a special rubber sheet with a soft edge filled with anti-static agent to prevent the record from being charged and scratched.<br><br>The arm uses a non-resonant static balanced pipe arm with a high-precision miniature bearing. This arm is designed to minimize the weight of the movable part of the arm, wear resistance, and inertial efficiency as much as possible to obtain good sensitivity.<br>In addition, it comes with a 0.5g step needle pressure direct reading scale, so you can obtain the desired needle pressure just by moving the knob forward or backward.<br>In addition, a sub-balance weight is attached to the cartridge, especially when using a special cartridge with its own weight.<br><br>The cartridge uses MC type.<br><br>It comes with a lightweight spare shell that solves the strength and resonance point by using a special light alloy and bending the edge downward as a reinforcement rib.<br>The dead weight including the lead wire is only 7g, and the connector of European standard is adopted, so it can be used for other arms.<br><br>Feather touch start / lifter interlocking cam mechanism is adopted.<br>Since it is a unique delay operation type of Sansui, even if it is turned ON/OFF by a sudden operation, a phenomenon such as random dancing on the lifter does not occur.<br><br>Since it is equipped with a lateral balancer, it can be adjusted so that the straight line connecting the center of gravity of the cartridge side and the center of gravity of the weight side always passes through the fulcrum.<br><br>The case is made of walnut and comes with a removable acrylic cover.<br><br>To prevent howling, an audio insulator with coil spring and rubber cushion is adopted.</p>
