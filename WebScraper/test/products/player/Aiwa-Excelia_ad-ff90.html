				<p class="detail">Stereo cassette deck equipped with pure amorphous head and Dolby HX Pro.<br><br>A pure amorphous head is used for the read / write head.<br>The amorphous material used in this head has a magnetic flux density that is several times to several tens of times higher than that of conventional crystalline head materials, and has the highest permeability as a core material for magnetic heads. Moreover, it has about 10 times higher wear resistance than permalloy.<br>The pure amorphous head has a high saturation magnetic flux density and employs a recording head with an extremely wide gap of 4 μ m, which enables recording of powerful signals with a margin without distortion.<br>In addition, in order to realize recording and playback over a wide dynamic range, we have minimized eddy current loss by using a 12-sheet multi-layer laminate structure made from an amorphous material that is processed as thin as 50 μ m.<br><br>Equipped with an automatic recording level adjustment.<br>At the Automatic Level, pressing and holding the Automatic button detects the peak level of music in between and automatically sets the level that best matches your tape.<br><br>It is equipped with Dolby HX Pro which applies active servo bias theory.<br>The Dolby HX Pro keeps the total effective bias constant by adjusting the bias to a deep level when there is a large number of mid - and low-frequency components and to a shallow level when there is a large number of high-frequency components. As a result, the saturation phenomenon of tape, which is easily caused by high-level high-frequency signals, is suppressed, enabling clear recording.<br>Also, Dolby HX Pro works only when recording, so it can be played on any deck.<br><br>It is equipped with a computer brain function that automatically sets the bias value, recording sensitivity and equalizer value in order to bring out the performance of the tape.<br>With the Computer Brain function, there are 32 adjustment points for bias, equalizer, and recording sensitivity, each of which selects the optimum value for the tape from 30000 choices in about 16 seconds.<br>In addition, it is equipped with a 3-position data memory in which data adjusted by computer brain is stored separately by normal chrome metal.<br><br>The mechanism part uses a super-stabilized torsion dual capstan system.<br>In the dual capstan system, two capstan units are installed, each of which is slightly displaced and rotated to improve uneven tension in the cassette half, and the tape and head are always pressed together with a constant force.<br>In the superstabilized dual-capstan system, the capstan is further subjected to a special surface treatment using micrograin processing to reduce slippage between the tape and the capstan and improve head touch.<br><br>Equipped with a multi-functional electronic counter that can display the remaining amount of tape in minutes and seconds.<br>Depending on the type of tape being used, the tape length switch can be toggled to count the remaining recording time from the C-46 tape to the C-120 tape. This counter also operates during fast forward and rewind.<br><br>Equipped with a Dolby B / C type noise reduction system.<br>In addition, it is equipped with an auto NR sensor that automatically selects and switches between ON/OFF of Dolby B/C.<br><br>Equipped with ADMS which is an automatic degaussing system, it prevents the head from being magnetized.<br><br>It is equipped with an intro play function that automatically plays the head of a song every 8 seconds.<br><br>It has a music sensor function to find the head of a song.<br><br>Equipped with an auto tape monitor that automatically switches between source and tape monitors according to operating conditions.<br><br>Equipped with an auto tape selector.<br><br>Equipped with FL meter with peak hold.<br><br>Equipped with tape-specific peak level display.<br><br>Equipped with REC balance function.<br><br>Equipped with headphone volume.<br><br>Equipped with a repeat mechanism.<br><br>Equipped with an MPX filter ON/OFF switch.<br><br>Remote controller connection terminal is mounted.<br><br>Equipped with a timer standby mechanism, and by connecting an external timer, it is possible to record absence and play alarm clock.</p>
