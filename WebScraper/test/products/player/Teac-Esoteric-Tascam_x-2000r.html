				<p class="detail">This tape deck incorporates technologies such as CA (cobalt amorphous) heads and newly designed equalizer amplifiers.<br><br>The X-2000R uses a cobalt amorphous head, a newly designed equalizer amplifier, and an improved accuracy of the tape travel system to enable almost flat characteristics up to 40 kHz.<br>The standard recording level is set at + 6 dB, which is compatible with high-performance tapes such as EE tapes.<br><br>Dbx is installed as a noise reduction system.<br>Dbx consists of electronic circuits that compress the original sound to 1/2 dB during recording and double during playback to return it to its original form, ensuring a high dynamic range and reducing tape noise.<br><br>A closed-loop dual capstan and full-tension servo mechanism has been adopted for the mechanism part, and modulation noise has been reduced by thorough review.<br><br>The head part adopts a 6-head mechanism in which each head for recording, reproduction, and erasing is independent of the reciprocating operation, and the mounting method adopts the fixed head method adopted in professional decks.<br>The erase head is installed outside the capstan shaft to shorten the tape span and ensure the stability of tape running.<br><br>The equalizer amplifier section consists of a fully push-pull configuration with vertical symmetrical circuits. In particular, the second stage is equipped with a bootstrap circuit to obtain a large gain at the first stage, and low distortion and high stability are achieved by using advanced phase compensation and feed-forward phase compensation.<br><br>CES (Computer Matic Edit System) is installed as an editing mechanism using a microcomputer.<br>The X-2000R uses a 5-digit LED linear counter that can be accurately counted every second by the rotation of the フーテージローラー. This allows you to accurately measure the total recording time and the time of a song, set the auto-spacer (silent recording) seconds, set the timing at the start of recording, and perform program counter functions.<br>In addition, the S. T. Z. (Search to 0) function returns to the counter 0 display from any position on the tape, and the S. T. C. (Search to queue) function returns to the position where the CUE button is pressed. The microcomputer determines whether to fast forward or rewind and sends the tape to that position.<br><br>Auto-spacer allows for up to 8 seconds of signalless recording space.<br><br>Equipped with a Dupli Sync function, you can copy to a cassette in synchronization.<br><br>Equipped with a tape selector with a new EE position.<br>By setting the recording bias and playback equalizer to match the EE tape, the frequency characteristics are improved, the dynamic range is expanded, and the noise level is reduced.<br>In addition, the head, amplifier, and oscillator systems have also been improved for EE tape, and the quality has been improved.<br><br>Equipped with full auto-reverse mechanism that works between counter 00000 and sensing tape.<br><br>It uses a motion sensing mechanism that makes the transition from quick winding to play operation smooth.<br><br>Equipped with 1-3, 4-2 track selection queue mechanism.<br><br>It is equipped with functions such as a smooth real-time pause function that starts from a recorded pause, and a playback pause function that enables accurate head positioning.<br><br>Equipped with a ± 6% pitch control function for both recording and playback.<br><br>Uses 5 mm thick front panel.<br><br>Equipped with an L/R independent recording mode switch and monitor switch.<br><br>It uses a soft electromagnetic brake to protect the tape.<br><br>Equipped with timer standby mechanism, recording of absence and alarm clock playback are possible.<br><br>The BIAS FINE function allows you to maximize the characteristics of your tape by adjusting the recording bias current adjustment volume of approximately ± 10%.<br><br>It is equipped with a block repeat mechanism that repeatedly reproduces an arbitrary section.<br><br>Equipped with capstan shaft cleaning pad.<br><br>There are 2 color variations of black and silver.<br><br>Equipped with a separately sold remote control unit connection terminal.<br><br>The wood case was sold separately as an option.</p>
