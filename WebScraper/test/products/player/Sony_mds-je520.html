				<p class="detail">This MD deck is equipped with various functions such as the roll of digital REC level.<br><br>A wide bit stream technology using the 4.5 generation DSP for ATRAC has been introduced, enabling recording and playback with a wide dynamic range of 20-bit accuracy.<br><br>For the DSP for the 4.5 generation ATRAC, we have newly developed an adaptive high-frequency control technology to improve high-frequency reproducibility and natural sound spread. This technology effectively uses limited data based on the human auditory sense. In response to an input signal, if the number of quantization bits is small, the high-frequency range is limited and the number of quantization bits is increased for a signal that feels distorted, and if the number of quantization bits is small, the high-frequency range is limited and the number of quantization bits is increased. In response to a signal containing a complex frequency component that is less affected by the lack of quantization bits, the reproduction band is extended to higher frequencies to improve high-frequency reproducibility.<br>The signal processing system has been improved by the combination of this adaptive high-frequency control technology and the extension of the operation word length in the wide bit stream, and the total harmonic distortion rate has been improved by about 8 dB compared to the conventional system.<br><br>It is equipped with a sampling rate converter that automatically converts 32 kHz and 48 kHz sampling frequency to 44.1 kHz.<br><br>Uses an eccentric insulator whose mounting hole to the chassis is offset from the center.<br>As a result, the vibrations transmitted from the outside cancel each other, making it difficult for them to be transmitted to the chassis. In particular, it is effective in attenuating the vibration components in the middle and high range that affect the sense of hearing.<br><br>Equipped with digital REC level control, the gain can be controlled from - ∞ dB to + 12 dB at the center of gain 0 dB.<br>It also has a built-in memory function that can store the set recording level for each input channel.<br><br>It is equipped with a music sync function. When you press the music sync button on the remote control and the connected device starts playing, it senses the input of a music signal and automatically starts recording.<br><br>It is equipped with a time machine recording function. If you press the multi-jog dial in the recording pause state, the sound recorded on the disc is traced back to the sound of up to 6 seconds before.<br><br>Equipped with a monaural recording and playback function that allows the disc to be used twice as long as the display.<br><br>It has a TOC EDTI function that allows you to divide, combine, and move songs. It also has an UNDO function that allows you to cancel the last edit and redo it.<br>In addition, it is equipped with a rehearsal function so that you can decide while checking the edit point in COMBINE or DIVIDE. To move the edit point, you can finely adjust the edit point in DIVIDE by up to -128 steps to + 127 steps (one step is approximately 0.06 seconds).<br><br>Equipped with the A-B ERASE function that allows you to easily erase between two specified points in a song.<br><br>It is equipped with a title function that can record up to 1,700 characters of disc names and song titles on the disc.<br>In addition to conventional alphabets, numbers and symbols, katakana characters can also be input, and input can be done from the main body or remote controller.<br><br>It uses a 2-line FL display that displays track name and elapsed time, disc name and track name separately in two upper and lower columns.<br><br>The SCMS (Serial Copy Management System) allows digital recording only for one generation and does not allow digital recording for two or more generations.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
