				<p class="detail">In pursuit of sound quality, this record player system takes advantage of the excellent unit design just like high-end machines.<br><br>The tone arm uses a shell-integrated carbon graphite straight arm.<br>Through vibration analysis using a computer, the shape and balance with the least resonance can be determined theoretically, and through repeated measurement and listening, a tone arm that enables more faithful transmission has been realized.<br><br>In order to suppress low-frequency resonance caused by warping or eccentricity of the record, a silicon oil braking system (on-off capable) is adopted. By pressing the damping knob on the upper part of the arm shaft, the silicon braking fin injected into the oil cup sinks and applies viscous braking to the arm. In addition, by cutting the tip of the braking fin (ring shape) at 45 degrees, it is designed to apply braking suitable for both horizontal and vertical directions simultaneously. This suppresses harmful low-frequency resonance and reduces intermodulation distortion.<br>It uses silicon oil, which is excellent as a braking oil and has little viscosity change with time or temperature. In addition, this silicon oil is stored in an oil cup made with high precision to prevent oil from oozing out and improve reliability.<br><br>A heavy weight arm base made of die cast with a stabilizer effect is used for the arm base.<br><br>The drive section is equipped with an SH-rotor type coreless motor.<br>We have succeeded in greatly reducing the wow flutter by moving the rotor bearing, which used to be located at the bottom of the motor, just below the turntable, and by adopting a coreless structure that does not cause cogging in principle.<br>Starting torque is 1.3kg-cm and further 330kg-cm<sup>2</sup>By combining a turntable with an inertial mass (including a turntable seat), stability without load fluctuation is realized even with a load of 200g corresponding to 100 tone arms with a needle pressure of 2.0g.<br>In addition, three highly reliable Hall elements developed by Pioneer are used in the magnetic pole switching mechanism of the motor. In addition, fine noise is eliminated by requiring micron-order machining order of microns down to fine parts.<br><br>Adopts a silent lift-up mechanism that achieves quiet and accurate operation.<br>First of all, the arm is moved up and down using a moving coil system that applies the operation principle of a speaker and operates without contact with DC voltage.<br>In addition, to detect the end position of the recording sound groove, a method of non-contact detection using a Hall element mounted inside the arm shaft and a magnet mounted opposite the Hall element is adopted, which realizes stable operation without impairing the performance of the arm.<br>Equipped with a pure electronic quick stop mechanism that operates in conjunction with a silent lift-up mechanism and stops the turntable instantly.<br><br>We have adopted a high-density cabinet that effectively controls the shaking of the cabinet due to the anti-energy effect of the rotational moment of the turntable with high inertia and high torque.<br>In addition, by adopting a large insulator with a unique low center of gravity structure, the structure is resistant to external vibration.<br><br>By using a damping adjustment adapter (sold separately), it is possible to adjust the oil braking at a level of 0 to 5 as in the case of the advanced model PL-70LII and PL-50LII.<br><br>Includes an S-shaped replacement arm pipe (with large weight) for easy replacement of the head shell.<br>Also, carbon graphite shell integrated straight arm pipe is sold separately.</p>
