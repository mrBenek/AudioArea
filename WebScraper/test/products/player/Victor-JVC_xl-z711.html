				<p class="detail">A CD player with K2 interface circuit.<br><br>A K2 interface circuit is mounted to eliminate digital distortion.<br>In the K2 interface circuit, in order to eliminate uncorrelated components such as jitters and ripples mixed in the digital signal processing section, a structurally and electrically independent block board is provided in the signal transmission process from the digital section to the analog section. In this board, the digital section and analog section are completely separated electrically by optical transmission using a Route 3 photocoupler and an independent power supply, and a digital code without uncorrelated components is generated in the analog section.<br>The K2 interface employs a signal generation method in which only the signal is detected as a code by high-speed switching operation of a semiconductor from the digital signal transmitted by a photocoupler, etc., and a new digital waveform is created based on this information. Therefore, uncorrelated components are removed from the signal received by the analog section.<br><br>The digital filter employs an 8 x oversampling digital filter. By shifting up the sampling frequency to 352.8 kHz, the adverse effects of digital noise are eliminated, and the low-pass filter characteristics after D/A conversion are made smooth.<br>This improves the phase characteristics and distortion factor.<br><br>The D/A converter uses a full-time 18-bit discrete 2 + 2D/A converter.<br>This D/A converter has a structure in which 18-bit information is separated into upper 16 bits and lower 2 bits. In particular, the lower bit, which is difficult to pursue accuracy, is made into a discrete DAC structure. By adding current to the 16-bit DAC, high accuracy with excellent linearity is realized. This enables 18 bits to operate full-time from Riki Oire to large input, and signal resolution is 4 times higher than 16 bits at all times.<br>In addition, a left and right independent configuration is adopted to eliminate mutual interference and phase shift between each channel.<br><br>The digital circuit, K2 interface circuit, and analog circuit are independent for each board in order to eliminate the mutual interference of each circuit.<br><br>It is equipped with two digital outputs which are coaxial with the optical system.<br><br>A large FL display has been adopted.<br>The FL ON/OFF switch also turns off the display during performance to prevent digital noise from the display. When not playing, the display returns automatically so that operability is not obstructed.<br><br>The chassis has a W-chassis structure and is equipped with a second high-rigidity heavyweight chassis under the chassis base.<br>The lower chassis is made of a composite material with high internal loss due to iron and resin. The uneven grid-like pattern effectively disperses and absorbs vibration. The structure supports both sides to form an extremely strong case.<br><br>A triple suspension floating mechanism structure is adopted for the mechanism part.<br>In order to protect the particularly important drive system from vibration and sound pressure, insulators are installed in the support parts of the foot, mechanical base and pickup base.<br><br>Equipped with a multi-disc editing function that allows you to select songs from 6 discs while calculating the remaining time.<br><br>Equipped with a CD disc memory function, you can input a message to the disc or each song and display it as text.<br><br>It is equipped with functions such as program function of 32 songs, random play, intro play and 5 kinds of repeat.<br><br>It uses a motor-driven remote control electric volume. This volume can also be used for headphones.<br>The operation status can be confirmed by flashing lights.<br><br>Uses a tray compatible with 8 cm single CD.<br><br>Equipped with synchronous terminal.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
