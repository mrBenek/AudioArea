				<p class="detail">This tape deck achieves high-speed operation at 38cm/s with excellent high-frequency recording and playback characteristics.<br><br>The transport mechanism has a single chassis with a thickness of 5 mm that reduces the plane accuracy of the reference plane and is firmly fixed with a die-cast frame to improve stability and reliability.<br>In addition, maintenance is improved by mounting the mechanism as a unit for each block.<br><br>The mechanism uses a 3-motor system.<br>The capstan uses a belt drive with a hysteresis synchronous motor of 4-pole / 8-pole 2-speed type, and a large flywheel with a diameter of 100 mm and a capstan shaft with a roundness of 0.2 μ or less to improve driving stability and constant speed.<br>A special induction type motor with a 6-pole inner rotor with excellent rotational speed versus torque performance is used to drive the reel table. The tape tension is stably applied and the optimum head touch is obtained. This motor generates less heat than the eddy current type commonly used for reels and can be used continuously for a long time.<br><br>The head section has a 3-head configuration to shorten the tape path and improve the stability of tape running.<br>The recording and reproducing heads use a high-pressure-type permalloy head with excellent sensitivity, bias characteristics, and magnetization characteristics. This type has a good head touch.<br><br>By using reel No. 10, you can play for twice as long as reel No. 7.<br><br>The PLAY operation can be performed from the REW (FF) state by skipping the STOP button. With this method, the tape is automatically started after the tape stops, so there is no need to worry about damaging the tape.<br>It also has a built-in timing cancel function. If you do not need much timing time before play, such as when using No. 7 normal size reel, you can start immediately by turning the PAUSE lever ON and then OFF.<br>The operation buttons adopt a solenoid control type with feather touch, and since it can be push-locked, preset is possible even when the power is off.<br><br>Low-noise silicon transistors are used in the microphone and recording amplifiers, and the dynamic range is widened by making full use of Pioneer&#39;s amplifier technology. In addition, we have succeeded in expanding the bandwidth of the playback amplifier by adopting a direct-coupled amplifier that does not use a capacitor for connecting each amplifier stage. In addition, we have adopted an electronic switch that uses semiconductors instead of conventional electronic switches with contacts, so that no click noise occurs.<br>The 125 kHz bias oscillator is equipped with an automatic stabilizing circuit for temperature compensation.<br><br>It is equipped with a tape selector that can independently select two levels of bias and two levels of equalizer. You can select the bias and equalizer according to the characteristics of the tape you are using.<br><br>It has a built-in mixing amplifier for two microphone channels (stereo) and two line channels (stereo).<br><br>Equipped with a PAUSE lever that can pause the tape for recording and regenerating condition.<br><br>Equipped with a large level meter.<br><br>Equipped with a recording mode switch.<br><br>Built-in one touch type reel clamper.<br><br>Equipped with playback level control.<br><br>Uses a highly stable differential band brake.<br><br>Recording and playback can be automatically started by combining with commercially available digital timers.<br><br>There was a carrying case kit sold separately.<br>This case is a leather case with a handle, and the side plate of the deck body is removed the deck body.</p>
