				<p class="detail">While inheriting high-performance technology, this cassette deck has further improved sound quality by adopting a sapphire capstan-based system that suppresses uneven rotation.<br><br>As a top-of-the-line model in the ESL series, the TC-K555ESL uses a copper-plated chassis that prevents magnetic distortion and a 265g cast iron insulator that is carefully selected to enhance vibration isolation. These features further enhance sound quality.<br><br>The Lapis Mechanical Deck is used to improve the accuracy of the Silent &amp; Quick Action Mechanical Deck used in the ES Series. This mechanism focuses on the rigidity and durability of the bearing of the capstan motor. By installing hard sapphire bearings on both sides of the take-up and supply of the bearing, rigidity, stability and durability are improved.<br>In addition, by using a 3-layer linear torque BSL direct drive motor with less rotational unevenness, extremely stable tape travel is achieved.<br><br>The head base uses a Bellick head base made of extremely rigid zinc die-cast to eliminate transmission of unwanted vibrations. In addition, stable azimuth precision phase characteristics prevent degradation of high-frequency characteristics.<br><br>A zinc die-cast base is adopted for the motor base to reduce modulation noise generated by external vibration such as sound pressure.<br>In addition, since the motor and wooden platform are integrated, higher precision rotation is obtained.<br><br>A quartz lock D. D. closed loop dual capstan system is used to hold the tape between two capstan sets centered on the head and pinch rollers to stabilize the running of the tape. This has many advantages such as improved wow flutter characteristics, reduced modulation noise, and stable head touch.<br><br>The recording and playback amplifiers are integrated on an independent board and arranged in two upper and lower stages to reduce mutual interference. The all-stage L/R twin mono / DC amplifier configuration eliminates channel interference.<br><br>Single-crystalline ESC-OCC wire rod with high purity oxygen-free copper of 99.997% or more and with almost no grain boundary has been adopted at important points.<br><br>Equipped with a CD Direct IN jack that can record the music signal of a CD as it is.<br><br>A typical 3-head deck uses a coil to prevent the bias signal from the read head from entering the deck, which generally occurs during simultaneous recording and re-recording. However, while this method eliminates the bias signal, it also degrades sound quality.<br>To solve this problem, we have adopted an active-type GIC bias filter in the reproduction amplifier section to eliminate bias signals.<br><br>A discrete FET is used for the input part of the reproduction equalizer amplifier, and the signal amplification is composed of two stages.<br>As a result, noise is suppressed by the FET first, and then amplified by the OP amplifier with excellent sound quality, so both high sound quality and low noise are achieved.<br><br>In order to eliminate a small amount of current leaking from the system control system to the audio system, a C-MOS buffer is used to suppress this current to about 1/10000.<br><br>Using a midship drive system, the mechanical deck and power supply are arranged in the center, and the control system and audio circuit are arranged separately on the left and right sides. This realizes a good weight balance in which the weight of the four legs is almost equal.<br>In addition, by adopting an inner chassis that divides the inside into three equal parts, rigidity is further increased and electromagnetic interference between each block is eliminated.<br><br>Using a 3-head system, it is possible to set the maximum head gap width for both recording and playback. Therefore, superior linearity and frequency characteristics can be obtained compared to the 2-head system.<br>A simultaneous recording monitor is also available to monitor recording conditions in real time.<br><br>It is equipped with a cassette stabilizer. When the tape is set, the stabilizer installed inside the cassette door firmly fixes the cassette half and suppresses the vibration of the tape.<br>The ES the ES Series uses a free-action holding arm, and the stabilizer is made of sorbacein, which effectively absorbs harmful vibrations.<br><br>Based on Sony&#39;s original amorphous laser head using an amorphous magnetic alloy, we have adopted a PC-OCC wound laser amorphous head in which the head winding has been changed to a PC-OCC winding.<br><br>Equipped with Dolby HX Pro, the effective bias amount during recording is controlled to the optimum value in units of 1/1000 second to prevent over-bias in the high band and improve linearity in the high band.<br><br>By using a super-bias and greatly shifting up the bias frequency, the frequency difference with the music signal is expanded to improve the resolution and characteristics of the high-frequency range.<br><br>Equipped with a bias calibration function, the bias value can be finely adjusted within ± 20% by the built-in oscillator while observing the indicated value on the meter.<br>It is also equipped with a recording calibration function that eliminates the difference between recording and playback levels due to tape sensitivity.<br><br>As a noise reduction system, it is equipped with Dolby NR B type and C type.<br><br>A cabtire cable is used for the power cable.<br>In addition, since the polarity display is attached, it is possible to adjust the polarity.<br><br>It is equipped with a gold-plated input / output terminal with low contact resistance and little secular change such as rust and corrosion.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.<br>This remote control is also equipped with a wireless CD sync recording function that allows users to enjoy synchronized recording without connecting a sync cord to a Sony remote-controlled CD player.<br><br>It uses a linear electronic counter with FL tube that is equipped with a subtraction function of minute and second display.<br><br>It is equipped with an auto-monitor function that simplifies playback operations. When you press the play button, it automatically switches to tape even if the monitor switch is in the source state.<br>Also, auto / manual can be selected.<br><br>It is equipped with a peak level meter with real time peak display and peak hold function.<br><br>Equipped with a display mode switch, it can be switched to 3 modes : all lights / counter only partial light / light off.<br><br>Equipped with AMS (Automatic Music Sensor) function that can quickly cue the beginning of the previous or next music.<br>In particular, the ES Series is easy to use with one touch operation.<br><br>Equipped with an auto tape selector, it automatically detects type I (normal), II (high position), or IV (metal).<br><br>Equipped with an autoplay function that automatically starts playing after rewinding, and a memory play function that starts playing from the position reset to counter 0.<br><br>By combining the timer sold separately, it is possible to record your absence and play the alarm clock.<br><br>Equipped with an autospace Rec Mute function that automatically records muting for approximately 4 seconds by pressing a button and temporarily stops it.<br><br>It is equipped with a power loading function. When you put a tape in the cassette lid and press the operation button such as play or rewind without closing the door, the tape is automatically loaded and the operation mode is entered.<br>This series of operations also works when using the remote control.</p>
