				<p class="detail">Double cassette deck with A. R. H. S. and LC-OFC / CA heads.<br><br>The head uses a CA (cobalt amorphous) head with LC-OFC winding to improve transmission characteristics.<br>Using the thin foil characteristic of amorphous alloy with no crystal structure, we have achieved a 13-layer laminate structure that is approximately four times the size of conventional SENDUST heads. The ribbon-shaped amorphous alloy greatly reduces eddy current loss, improves MOL with excellent magnetic properties, achieves flat high-frequency characteristics, and achieves high wear resistance without grain boundary delamination.<br><br>The head part adopts A. R. H. S. (Acculine ローティティング Head System) which has improved the perfection of the rotary head system.<br>The A. R. H. S. realizes a quiet rotational sound by using high-precision die-casting with light weight and high shock absorption power for the head holder and bearing of the rotating part, and eliminates aberration of azimuth by small rotation of shock.<br>In addition, it is equipped with a reflective I. R. (infrared) sensor to increase the reverse speed of the reverse deck, and the I. R. sensor quickly detects the semi-transparent tape attached to the end of the tape, thereby almost eliminating the loss of time due to reverse.<br><br>In the power supply section, the power supply of the amplifier system and the power supply of the mechanism system are completely separated, and the winding of the transformer is also completely separated. This prevents sound quality degradation due to mutual bias interference.<br>In addition, the earth potential is clarified by ± 2 power supply system, and the SN ratio, transient response characteristics and distortion factor are improved by reducing system noise.<br><br>An all-DC amplifier is used to improve low-frequency expansion and reproduction capability. The head and amplifier are directly connected to each other without a condenser. This enables reproduction up to the ultra-low-frequency range and improves the distortion factor of the low-frequency range.<br><br>Most of the amplifier systems, from signal input to output, are integrated on a single board. Moreover, the display and switches are connected directly to the board to prevent noise and reduce the length of wires.<br>In addition, there are no variations in parts, and parts such as aluminum electrolytic capacitors and film capacitors exclusively for audio that are digital compatible and designed for high sound quality are used. In addition, LC-OFC, which improves transmission characteristics, is used for signal lead wires to achieve 3S (Simple, Straight, Small) and reduce signal turbidity and degradation.<br><br>It is equipped with dbx NR as a noise reduction system, and by adopting L/R symmetrical integrated one chip LSI, the fluctuation of parts is eliminated, and the sound quality degradation is suppressed.<br>Encoding and decoding with dbx NR provides an NR effect of 30-40 dB in the entire audible band and a dynamic range of 110 dB, exceeding the limits of cassette tapes.<br><br>It adopts a 3-motor system and realizes a quieter mechanism by using a dedicated motor for capstan drive, reel drive, and mechanism.<br><br>It is equipped with a CD level check function that enables accurate CD monitoring.<br><br>It is equipped with dubbing functions such as 2-speed (constant speed / double speed) dubbing and random program dubbing system which can rearrange and dub up to 19 songs in AB plane.<br>In addition, it is equipped with a reverse edit function that allows you to Oatley jump to the II deck (recording) side with any music when performing random program dubbing, an intro check memory dubbing function that allows you to specify dubbing music while checking the intro, a synchro reverse function that aligns the start of dubbing on the B side of the I deck / II deck, and an editing dubbing function that allows you to change the selection of the I deck and replace the cassette without stopping the recording mode of the II deck when performing normal speed dubbing.<br><br>It is equipped with a program performance function that plays up to 19 songs in the order you want to listen.<br><br>It is equipped with a CPS system that searches and plays any song from the current song up to 19 songs before and after it.<br><br>It is equipped with a CPS pause standby function that searches for up to 19 songs before and after and waits for playback.<br>By repeating I deck and II deck alternately, relay playback can be performed without waiting time.<br><br>Equipped with a CDS function that directly selects songs in the order of recording on the tape.<br><br>Equipped with an intro check function that plays each song for 15 seconds.<br><br>Equipped with a blank scan function that automatically skips over a no-signal state of 10 seconds or more.<br><br>Equipped with an electronic counter that can switch between I deck and II deck.<br><br>Equipped with a continuous function that enables continuous playback and recording of I deck / II deck.<br><br>Equipped with an FL multi-function display controlled by a microprocessor.<br><br>Equipped with an auto tape selector that automatically switches between Normal/CrO2/Metal.<br><br>Equipped with an auto rec mute function of approximately 4 seconds.<br><br>It comes with a wireless remote control with 26 functions that can be operated all at hand.</p>
