				<p class="detail">ES series CD player with Advanced H. D. L. C. (high density linear converter system).<br><br>Advanced H. D. L. C is used for the D/A conversion method, and a newly developed score digital filter is used for the digital filter, and an advanced pulse D/A converter is used for the D/A converter.<br><br>The digital filter section is equipped with a score digital filter (CXD 2567) with a newly introduced dither method.<br>In addition to 45-bit oversampling technology, this circuit is Sony&#39;s first to add a pseudo-random signal to the signal before D/A conversion. This circuit decorrelates the requantization noise generated at the output of the digital filter with the audio signal, thereby further improving sound quality.<br>* SCORE is an abbreviation of Subliminal Correlation = decorrelation.<br><br>The D/A converter is equipped with an advanced pulse D/A converter (CXD-2562).<br>The Pulse D/A converter uses oversampling and noise shaping techniques to compress a 16-bit digital signal and outputs an audio signal with a current source and an electronic switch. This eliminates glitches, 0 cross distortion, and differential non-linear distortion that were unavoidable with conventional methods. The Advanced Pulse D/A converter is a further development of this. The Advanced Pulse D/A converter reduces requantization noise in the audible band and uses third order noise shaping to avoid a sudden increase in noise outside the audible band. The Advanced Pulse D/A converter is an IC with the introduction of Sony&#39;s proprietary high-precision arithmetic operation method that leads to a higher density pulse output.<br>In the advanced pulse D/A converter, two outputs of pulse length modulation (PLM) waves, which are complementary to each other, are differentially synthesized, and a complimentary service PLM consisting of single-channel 4D/A outputs is employed to achieve even higher precision and resolution.<br>The CDP 777 esj employs a two chip mode using two chips of advanced pulse D/A converter ICs. The separation characteristics are further improved by performing D/A conversion on the left and right channels independently.<br><br>It is equipped with a direct digital sink and the master clock is formed on the same chip as the pulse D/A converter. This allows the electronic switch of the pulse D/A converter to be turned on and off more accurately, eliminating harmful jitter and reducing sound quality degradation.<br><br>The analog low-pass filter employs a GIC-type low-pass filter in which passive elements such as capacitors do not enter in series. This filter reduces high-frequency noise without distorting the audio signal and outputs it to the line amplifier.<br>A DC servo amplifier is used for the line amplifier. By eliminating the coupling capacitor, coloring is suppressed and stable amplification up to ultra-low frequencies is possible. In addition, an FET suitable for small-signal amplification with a smooth start-up operation is operated in A-class operation at the output stage.<br>In addition, the CDP-0ESJ uses an FET input, and the high-impedance input characteristic of FET is used to ensure the separation of noise components from the low-pass filter at the front stage. 777 ESJ FET input to separate noise components.<br><br>The servo circuit uses a high-precision digital servo.<br>In this circuit, the signal from the optical pickup is A/D converted, filtered and controlled by digital processing, and then D/A converted again to operate the optical pickup, making it possible to adjust the servo amount according to each disc.<br>The high-precision servo uses a high-sampling rate, high-precision, high-resolution A/D converter and D/A converter to realize a more ideal servocontrol and low power consumption by digitizing.<br><br>A fine drive circuit has been adopted, and the drive circuit of the optical pickup is composed of balanced push-pull with ± 2 power supply system capable of canceling the in-phase noise component, thereby reducing noise components from entering the earth line.<br><br>The mechanism uses a G-base unit reinforced by glass fiber with calcium carbonate added to a special resin to prevent loss of trace accuracy due to vibration and resonance.<br>In addition, copper-plated copper-tight metal material with sufficient thickness is used as the base material for the chassis to thoroughly eliminate vibration.<br><br>The spindle motor for rotating the disk is equipped with a BSL motor that provides high precision and quiet rotational performance with little cogging. The spindle bearing is made of sapphire with high hardness and low friction coefficient, providing high durability.<br><br>An acoustic shield is used in the opening of the front panel where the tray is stored, a damper made of special rubber material is provided to improve airtightness, and the G-tray, which is the same as the G-base, is used for the disc tray.<br>In addition, it is equipped with a new stayable lock mechanism, and by fixing the tray with lock arms in four places (two on each side of the tray) during performance, pitching in the longitudinal direction and rolling in the lateral direction are suppressed.<br>In order to further reduce vibration in the CDP 777 esj, the right and left lock arms are connected by a single beam to provide a strong lock.<br><br>The FB chassis is used for the chassis, and vibration is eliminated by firmly joining the entire chassis with a frame surrounding the outer circumference and beams passing through the front and rear front and rear, and vibration is eliminated. In addition, the CDP-777ESJ uses copper plating inside the chassis and a high-rigidity aluminum top plate to reduce magnetostriction by thoroughly promoting non-magnetism.<br><br>It employs a center mechanical mounting system in which the mechanical deck is located in the center of the chassis, minimizing the rotational moment applied to the chassis and improving the stability against vibration.<br><br>Uses fine ceramic insulators for the legs.<br><br>The board layout of the ES Series is also taken into consideration. The audio and digital circuit boards are separated in a separate sheet configuration. Furthermore, the digital circuit board is moved to the lower part of the mechanical deck to minimize noise from the digital part to the audio part.<br>The CDP 777 esj uses glass-epoxy ES substrates for digital circuits, audio circuits, and power circuits.<br><br>The power supply section has a 2-transformer configuration. The digital servo section and audio section are fed independently, and the D/A converter section is equipped with a dedicated power supply circuit to eliminate interference from the power supply. In addition, in terms of the mechanism, rubber dampers are used in four places to prevent vibration of the transformer from being transmitted.<br>The CDP-0EJ is equipped with a twin-core transformer in which two transformers are enclosed together in a shield case with anti-vibration measures. The CDP-0EJ 777 is equipped with a twin-core transformer.<br><br>Aluminum front panel and side wood are adopted.<br><br></p>
