				<p class="detail">A tape deck with 4-channel playback function added to SD 5000.<br><br>In addition to 2-channel recording and playback, 4-channel playback is available.<br><br>Newly developed hard permalloy head is used for the head part.<br>The core material uses hard permalloy, which has a high magnetic saturation point and the most excellent electromagnetic conversion characteristics. It has acquired more than five times the wear resistance of conventional permalloy.<br>In addition, for 4-track applications, a large core is used to provide sufficient input resistance, and the low-frequency range is covered up to 20 Hz. The high-frequency characteristics are also improved by accurate gap and uniform mirror-lapping due to precision processing. In addition, the head shape is a hyperbolic type to improve the head touch and suppress undulations in the low-frequency range.<br><br>The SD 5050 s uses a 4-channel playback head.<br><br>A 3-motor mechanism is used for the mechanism part.<br>A 4-pole / 8-pole hysteresis synchronous motor is used for the capstan motor. The dynamic balance of the rotor is perfectly adjusted, and the wow, flutter and speed deviation are reduced by using a large flywheel with high rotational inertia efficiency.<br>A 6-pole induction type is used for the two reel motors.<br>The capstan shaft is driven by a belt drive system, and the speed switching between 19cm/s and 9.5cm/s is done electrically by changing the number of poles of the motor.<br><br>The capstan shaft is used for the capstan shaft, and after precise centerless polishing, super finish finish is applied.<br>In addition, the roundness of the capstan, which determines the quality of the capstan, is carefully checked one by one using the Tully Ronde roundness measuring machine made in the United Kingdom, which is used worldwide, and is kept to a precise value of less than 0.5 μ.<br><br>In order to further improve the wow and flutter characteristics, an impedance roller made of a large flywheel is adopted. At the same time, modulation noise caused by harmful vibration just before the head is eliminated. In addition, the tension of the tape is kept constant by two tension arms on the left and right sides to prevent excessive force from being applied to the tape.<br>These mechanisms are firmly fixed to the die-cast transport base to prevent the effects of vibration and shock.<br><br>All push button system with feather touch by electromagnetic plunger and relay is used for mechanical control.<br>Each control button is completely independent and you can press the control button freely without having to go through the stop button each time, so you can quickly move to the desired action.<br>In addition, a delay circuit is built into each operation button, so that no excessive force is applied to the tape and the pinch roller does not press on the capstan until the tension becomes constant.<br>When you press the play button during fast forward, the tape does not become loose or cut.<br><br>The E-ENF type equalizer circuit is a 3-stage amplifier with high linearity and low distortion factor. Moreover, the saturation level of the whole amplifier is set high enough so that there is no distortion due to large input.<br>The bias oscillation circuit adopts a push-pull method and is designed so that the bias waveform is accurate and the distortion is minimized.<br><br>Equipped with a recording bias selector to support low-noise tapes.<br>In HIGH mode, the recording bias is deeper than in STANDARD mode, and the recording level is increased by 3 dB.<br><br>With a record selector, you can choose between stereo and monaural recording. Also, if you set it to the standby position, recording will not start even if you accidentally press the record button.<br>In addition, it is also possible to record after recording.<br><br>It comes with an echo recording plug that can be inserted into the DIN socket to record any echo added to the line input.<br>In addition, the input levels of the microphone and line are adjusted separately, so mixing recording and sound-on-sound are possible.<br><br>Uses a Oatley bath system with sensing foils.<br><br>Equipped with four large VU meters.<br>The scale of this meter is an expanded type, close to a straight line, and the interval between low level and high level is wide, and accurate monitoring is possible.<br><br>It has Queue and Pause buttons.<br><br>Uses Sansui&#39;s original reel clamper.<br><br>Each channel has its own level adjustment.<br><br>It is compatible with the separately sold wired remote controller and can be operated from 4m away.</p>
