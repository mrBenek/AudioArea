				<p class="detail">This is a stereo cassette deck that inherits the design policy of TC-K555ESII as much as possible and thoroughly polished the sound quality.<br><br>The head is equipped with a laser amorphous head that uses LC-OFC for the coil winding.<br>LC-OFC is made by increasing the size of 99.99% pure oxygen-free copper crystals, reducing the number of crystal boundaries, and reducing distortion due to capacitive reactances. It is used for coil winding to further improve sound quality.<br><br>A closed-loop dual capstan system is used to achieve stable tape travel.<br>In this system, the tape is sandwiched between two sets of capstan heads and pinch rollers to stabilize the tape running.<br>As a result, the flutter characteristics for eliminating tape vibration from the reel have been improved. In addition, since the vibration span of the tape can be shortened, modulation noise can be eliminated out of the audible band. In addition, constant head touch can be obtained by using two tape tensions, thus improving the stability of tape running and the adhesion between the tape and the head.<br><br>All stages of the L/R twin-mono construction of the recording and playback amplifiers of the amplifier section are designed to be symmetrical. By equalizing the signal flow of the left and right channels, mutual interference is suppressed, and interference of the front and rear stages is suppressed as much as possible.<br>In addition, the amplifier section is integrated on a single printed circuit board, greatly reducing the amount of wiring material to be used, and LC-OFC1000 is used for the wiring material between the head and the board.<br>In addition, by using carefully selected parts such as newly developed electrolytic capacitors, we ensure a design that emphasizes sound quality.<br><br>The newly developed dual symmetry process Dolby IC is used for the IC constituting the Dolby NR B/C circuit.<br>The IC for the left and right channels is designed to be symmetrical with each other, and it is further integrated into one package, so that the amplifier section can be put together more simply and the sound quality is improved.<br><br>Equipped with + / - 20% bias fine adjustment function which can be adjusted by 2 positions of frequently used TypeI/II.<br><br>Equipped with a linear electronic counter that digitally displays the amount of tape travel in minutes and seconds.<br>In addition, it has a subtraction function that can directly read the remaining amount of the tape.<br><br>It is equipped with a wide-range peak program meter by double indication system which simultaneously displays peak value for every moment and peak hold for about 2.4 seconds.<br><br>Equipped with functions such as counter-linked memory stop / play, Rec Mute with auto space, MPX filter switch, etc.<br><br>With the separately sold remote control unit, various remote controls such as wired / wireless / foot remote control are possible.<br><br>Continuous recording / alarm clock playback is possible with the separately sold timer.<br>Also, by using RM-65 (sold separately), it is possible to play synchronized start / stop play with Sony player.<br><br>The input / output jacks are gold-plated.</p>
