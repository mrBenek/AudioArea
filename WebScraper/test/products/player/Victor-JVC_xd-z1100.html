				<p class="detail">The DAT deck was developed using Victor&#39;s tape audio and VHS technologies.<br><br>The mechanism part adopts a fine tracking mechanism that pursues high precision of micron order.<br>In this mechanism, we pursue micron-order precision for precision parts such as Sendust / ferrite composite heads and rotary drums. At the same time, we have developed original MR-type direct drive motors and drum direct drive motors to achieve stability and high precision of the drive system.<br>In addition, VHS technology and know-how are applied to the M-type loading of the bending and extension two joint ring, which is patented by VICTOR/JVC. The angle of the inclined post that does not provide a stable tape path based on theoretical values alone, the angle at which the tape hits the head, and the mechanism for regulating the tape position. In addition, VHS technology and know-how are applied. In addition, VHS technology and know-how are applied to the angle of the inclined post and the control mechanism of the tape position. In addition, VHS technology and know-how are applied to the rotating head part. In addition, VHS technology and know-how are applied to the rotating head part. In addition, VHS technology and know-how are applied to the rotating head part. In addition, VHS technology and know-how are applied to the rotating head part. In addition, VHS technology and know-<br><br>For DAT tapes, there are ATF areas on both sides of the PCM area in each track. The servo circuit reads the ATF signal that the head picks up during the trace to compensate for track deviation. The allowable range is ± 3 μ m.<br>The XD-Z1100 uses a large flywheel with a diameter of 40 mm for its precise rotational head mechanism to reduce jitter and ensure that it receives ATF signals. Moreover, by introducing a powerful servo circuit, it achieves excellent characteristics with track deviation less than half of the reference value.<br>In addition, in order to keep the tension of the tape constant, which is different at the beginning and the end of winding of the tape, a tension servo mechanism is installed, so that the drive system is always stabilized and the durability of the tape is also improved.<br><br>The A/D converter employs a high-speed cascade-integration type A/D converter of one chip configuration with the same LR balance.<br>The D/A converter is equipped with a newly developed digital filter for DAT with an overflow limiter and a 1-chip successive approximation D/A converter.<br><br>The digital &amp; servo system and analog system are completely separated, and the audio circuit is packaged on a single glass composite substrate and housed in a shield box. This reduces magnetic retention and induction noise and protects the audio circuit from microcomputer and servo system noise.<br><br>In addition to analog input / output, coaxial and optical digital input / output terminals are mounted.<br><br>In the power supply section, the three power supplies for the servo current section, audio section and digital section are separated from each other to eliminate electromagnetic effects.<br>The analog power supply section uses a ± 2 power supply with a low impedance design with a ripple rejection rate of 74 dB, providing a stable power supply.<br><br>In order to protect the mechanism from vibration, a non-resonance and non-vibration design is adopted.<br>In addition to pursuing a low center of gravity and vibration control structure with a high-rigidity heavy solid base, a tough body is formed with aluminum top and side covers of 3 mm thickness.<br>In addition, the large insulator suppresses external vibration of speakers, etc.<br><br>In addition to 48kHz/16bit normal recording / rerecording, 32kHz/12bit long recording / rerecording is supported, and 4 hours recording / rerecording is possible with R-120 tape.<br>It also supports two play-only modes for music tapes : 44.1 kHz / 16-bit standard and wide track.<br><br>The cassette door has a gull-wing door that smoothly moves up and down to open and close the tape slot. Combined with the cassette holding mechanism of the motor drive, it holds the tape in place while maintaining the accuracy of the mechanism.<br><br>Equipped with an after-sampling monitor, the digital input can be directly D/A converted and output to the analog terminal. In addition, the analog input can be monitored by D/A conversion immediately after A/D conversion. Therefore, it is possible to check the sound quality and level just before recording.<br>It can be monitored continuously during recording, and after sampling can be monitored by pressing the Call / Monitor key at stop.<br><br>Equipped with 3 x speed search by capstan drive, fast forward and rewind can be performed while listening to voice.<br><br>It includes an active bit display that directly reads the active bit, an average / peak parallel display meter with peak hold, and a digital peak display that displays margins for full bit levels for precise adjustment of recording levels.<br><br>It is equipped with a multi-mode display adopting a large FL tube.<br>This display displays the overload indicator, level meter, digital peak display, memory indicator, repeat indicator, tape mode indicator, warning indicator, digital counter, counter mode indicator, program No display, subcode indicator, and after-sampling monitor indicator.<br><br>Equipped with a digital input indicator.<br>If this indicator is on, digital copying is possible, and if the PCM-ID contains a digital copy prohibited signal or a digital signal with a sampling frequency of 44.1 kHz, the PCM-ID will flash quickly.<br>When there is no digital input signal, it blinks slowly.<br><br>It supports DAT specific subcode system.<br>As a result, the following functions are enabled : Start ID cue and direct selection by Program No., random access program for up to 50 songs, Skip function by Skip ID, Auto-rewind function which automatically stops at END information or at the end of tape winding and rewinds to the beginning of the tape, Intro-scan using Start ID, Blank search for END information or unrecorded portion, Repeat function for whole tape / desired song / 2 points.<br><br>Equipped with auto REC mute which can make unrecorded part with one touch.<br><br>Equipped with a timer start mechanism, you can turn on the power and start recording / playback at the desired time by using an optional timer together.<br><br>Equipped with a sync terminal, it can be synchronized with JVC&#39;s CD player and cassette deck with a sync terminal.<br><br>Wireless remote control with 10 keys is included.<br><br>The side panel was sold separately as an option.</p>
