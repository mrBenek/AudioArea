				<p class="detail">Based on the D-07, this DAT deck is equipped with Legato link conversion S and further improved sound quality.<br><br>For recording and playback in the ultra-high-frequency range exceeding 20 kHz, it is equipped with a high-sampling (HS) mode in which the sampling frequency is increased from 48 kHz to 96 kHz, twice that of the conventional one, enabling recording and playback in a wide band up to 44 kHz.<br>The maximum recording time in High Sampling mode is 1/2 of the conventional Standard (SP) mode.<br><br>It is equipped with Legato link conversion S.<br>In the conventional Legato link conversion, the waveform of the original signal was estimated and reproduced based on the 1/f attenuation characteristic for the component of 20 kHz or higher. However, in the Legato link conversion S, an independent harmonic generation circuit is added for overtones. The overtone component of 20 kHz or higher is generated from the attenuation characteristic based on the estimation of the original sound, and the reproduction band is expanded by adding it together with the time axis.<br><br>When playing back digital sources such as CDs, it is equipped with a DAC mode that allows you to use only the D/A converter function with the newly developed Legato link conversion S. This mode converts the input digital source into an analog signal with a 20 kHz or higher component and outputs it.<br><br>An 18-bit multi-bit converter is used on the A/D side, and a dither circuit is incorporated to suppress non-linear distortion and 0 cross distortion.<br>In addition, the D/A side employs a multi-bit DAC that eliminates the generation of 0 cross distortion by a unique method. In this method, two 20-bit DACs with exactly the same characteristics are integrated into one chip, and + and - region waveforms are independently D/A converted. At that time, the conventional 1 LSB level difference is expressed by the presence or absence of 1 LSB compensation current, not by inversion of all bits including MSB. In principle, the generation of 0 cross distortion is eliminated, and reproducibility and linearity of small signals are improved.<br><br>The head is equipped with a high-output AT head with precision technology for high-speed head rotation in high sampling mode.<br>It is an all track structure with 20 μ m uniform track processing in the track trace direction. Glass is welded on both sides of the head to ensure high abrasion resistance. In addition, a special polishing process is applied to the gap to realize a stable tape touch.<br><br>We take thorough anti-vibration and anti-vibration measures, including a panel stabilizer with anti-vibration rubber that suppresses microvibration around the front panel, a cassette stabilizer that securely holds tapes and prevents sound quality deterioration caused by vibration, a honeycomb chassis that supports mechanisms and circuits, and a large insulator and bonnet anti-vibration structure.<br>Copper plating is applied to the chassis, mechanical base, and rear panel to reduce high-frequency impedance and noise.<br><br>At the beginning of each song (start ID part) is equipped with a character recording function (character pack) that can record up to 60 characters of favorite information such as the name of the song, the name of the performer, and the title of the source.<br>The recorded information is scrolled on the display at the start of each song and can be displayed again by pressing the button during the performance.<br><br>It is equipped with a CD-Q code sync start ID recording function. When recording digital input from a CD, the start ID is automatically recorded based on the track number and index in the CD-Q code data transmitted by the digital interface. Even if there is no silence between songs, the start ID can be recorded reliably.<br><br>It is equipped with a Table of Contents (TOC) function that records the number of recorded songs and time data of each song at the beginning of the tape.<br><br>Equipped with digital faders, fade in and fade out functions for digital input recording / rerecording and analog input recording / rerecording.<br>In addition, the operation functions during playback include random play and time skip using a microcomputer based on TOC information, one point memory which records points on the tape and plays them with one touch, and fine queue / review functions.<br><br>In addition to the conventional three modes of 96 kHz High Sampling (HS) mode, 48 kHz Standard (SP) mode and 32 kHz Long Time Mode, an additional 44.1 kHz Standard (SP) mode with the same sampling frequency as CD is installed when analog input is used.<br>96 kHz Digital Out in HS mode is also supported.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
