				<p class="detail">A 3-head cassette deck equipped with Dolby B/C NR, Dolby HX Pro, and dbx NR.<br><br>Closed-loop dual capstan system is adopted for the mechanism part.<br>In this method, two capstan units are installed on the supply side and the take-up side, so that the tape is maintained at a constant tension while it passes through the head, enabling accurate recording and playback without unnecessary vibration.<br><br>Equipped with Dolby HX Pro to improve recording characteristics.<br>The Dolby HX Pro automatically adjusts the amount of bias according to the strength of the high-frequency level of the recorded signal. Even when the overtone component of music is strong, the high-frequency range due to excessive bias is prevented, and the frequency characteristics and dynamic range are greatly improved.<br><br>The bias frequency is set to 210 kHz, twice that of the conventional 105 kHz. By using a high bias, the audio signal and the bias are sufficiently separated from each other to reduce the beat distortion and intermodulation noise caused by interference between the signals.<br>In addition, the recording amplifier uses a constant current drive system, enabling a head drive that does not depend on the impedance change of the head due to the frequency of the signal being recorded. As a result, the dynamic margin and current distortion of the recording system have been improved by more than 6 dB compared with conventional systems.<br><br>As a noise reduction system, dbx NR is also installed in addition to Dolby B/C.<br>Dbx NR not only reduces annoying high-frequency noise but also greatly improves the S/N ratio in the mid-low range by compressing and expanding the entire audio band.<br><br>An amorphous 12-sheet laminated combination head has been adopted for the recording / reproducing head.<br>In addition, LC-OFC is used for the head winding and signal wiring material, and OFC is also used for the printed circuit board, thus realizing OFC for all signal systems and reducing transmission distortion.<br><br>The regenerative amplifier section is a DC amplifier using dual FET.<br><br>We aim to further improve sound quality by adopting quality parts for audio.<br><br>Equipped with Yamaha&#39;s original ORBiT system, the test signal is automatically recorded and played back to indicate whether the bias level is over or under on the display. By adjusting the bias volume with reference to the displayed bias information, the optimum value can be achieved.<br><br>The power supply section uses a 3-winding large massive power transformer in which the mechanism display system and amplifier system are separated from the windings.<br>In addition, the amplifier system is a 4-constant voltage power supply system in which independent regulators are provided for each of the four units, i.e., a read / write amplifier, a Dolby HX Pro, a Dolby B/C NR, and a dbx NR, to eliminate mutual interference between each unit and to ensure that each unit works ideally.<br><br>The winding of the power transformer is filled with a compound agent to reduce unnecessary vibration, and a non-magnetic aluminum base is used to secure the transformer to the chassis to prevent magnetic loops.<br><br>It is equipped with a direct selection function that allows you to skip up to 99 songs before and after.<br><br>Equipped with a 9-track direct program function.<br><br>It is equipped with an intro scan that plays back the beginning of a song about 15 seconds at a time.<br><br>Equipped with a linear counter with tape length switching function.<br>With a built-in microcomputer, it is possible to display highly accurate travel time according to the length of the tape, and it is also possible to display the remaining time during recording and playback.<br><br>Equipped with timer recording and re-mechanism that can record absence and play alarm clock by combining an external timer.<br><br>It comes with a 28-key full remote control for most deck operations.</p>
