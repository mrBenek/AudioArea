				<p class="detail">CD player equipped with AL24Processing.<br><br>It is equipped with AL24 Processing, an original analog waveform reproduction technology.<br>The AL24 Processing inherits the technology of the ALPHA Plocessing, reduces quantization distortion further, and supports high-bit and high-sampling of next generation media.<br>The AL24Processing achieves 24-bit quality reproduction of input 16-bit digital data with greatly improved processing accuracy. It also supports 96 kHz sampling frequency. With 24-bit quality reproduction, the ability to reproduce music at low-level playback, such as when music disappears silently or starts from silence, is enhanced.<br><br>The D/A D/A converter is used for the D/A converter.<br>The multi-24-bit D/A converter is less susceptible to fluctuations in the power supply voltage (current), and the in-band quantization distortion level is constant regardless of frequency, enabling clear playback with less noise.<br>The DCD-S10III has a 4 dac configuration in which two D/A converters are used for each channel in differential operation. This configuration, combined with Λ S. L. C., which theoretically eliminates 0 cross distortion, realizes excellent sound even for minute signals.<br><br>A cast metal base with excellent vibration damping characteristics is used for the mechanism and transformer part to suppress the effect of vibration from the mechanism and transformer part, which is a vibration source, on sound quality.<br>In addition, it employs a center mechanical mount with high structural stability, a mechanical cover that reduces the effect of vibration from the drive mechanism to the circuit, a large sintered alloy insulator with vibration absorbing material attached, a 15 mm thick front panel, a triple structure bottom cover and double structure top cover to completely eliminate sound degradation caused by vibration from inside and outside.<br>The chassis is plated with copper to prevent interference from high-frequency noise.<br><br>The tray is made of a highly vibration-resistant coating containing protein. In addition, it is equipped with a lightweight and highly rigid aluminum die-cast shaft receiver with excellent vibration control, and a plate attached to the lower part of the tray to prevent delicate deformation of the tray, ensuring stable rotation and absorbing vibration, enabling highly accurate signal reading.<br><br>Equipped with an HDCD decoder, it is possible to draw out the characteristics of high resolution and low distortion that are characteristic of HDCD-compatible discs when playing back.<br><br>It can be used as a stand-alone D/A converter with one optical and one coaxial external digital input terminal.<br>The digital input is compatible with 96kHz/24bit digital signals such as DVD, and can also be used as a digital selector since the digital input can be switched by the Source selector of the main unit.<br><br>High-performance pickup is used for the pickup part.<br>This pickup has a simple structure with a minimum number of parts to improve trace accuracy, reliability and durability.<br>Combined with the excellent anti-vibration performance of the S. V. H. loader, it realizes high-precision signal reading.<br><br>In addition to the digital and analog circuits, the transformer and circuit board are separated to prevent the deterioration of sound quality caused by digital signals.<br>In addition, the digital system is compact to minimize interference with the analog system, and the highly conductive copper plated chassis reduces the influence of electromagnetic waves on sound.<br><br>Equipped with a digital servo.<br>This circuit detects the condition of the disk and adjusts it to achieve optimum servocontrol for each disk.<br><br>We use carefully selected parts such as detachable extra-thick power cords using OFC wires, ICs such as D/A converters, resistors, capacitors, and wiring materials.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
