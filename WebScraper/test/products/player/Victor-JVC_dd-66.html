				<p class="detail">3-head &amp; DD series cassette deck.<br><br>A pulse servo DD motor is used for the mechanism.<br>This motor uses a Hall element developed at Victor Central R &amp; D Center for polarity switching to realize a brushless structure that eliminates mechanical contacts. In addition, by removing the core and slot, rotating irregularities such as cocking and noise are eliminated, making it possible to achieve smaller size and higher performance.<br>FG servo is used for the servo circuit, and detection error is suppressed even if positional deviation occurs by the all-around integration type of 204 pole 102 pulse. In addition, in order to prevent positional deviation, the FG magnet is coaxial with the capstan, and it is magnetized after holding the center.<br>In addition, in order to prevent the rotational accuracy from being affected by temperature changes and variations in parts, a newly developed multi-pride bridge drive circuit is adopted to improve wow and flutter. In addition, a composite material effective against modulation noise is adopted for the flywheels to eliminate flutter components caused by squeal (vibration) and cloudiness in the high-frequency range.<br><br>The mechanism part of the 3-head &amp; DD series has been further improved for the 3-head.<br>In the conventional 3-head system, tension was applied by sandwiching the tape between an erasing head and a pad. However, in the new mechanism, the structure of the mechanism itself has been reconsidered and the tension pad has been eliminated by improving the accuracy. This eliminates the driving instability caused by friction and reduces modulation noise.<br>In addition, the operation feeling is improved by suppressing mechanical operation sound as much as possible despite the solenoid operation with good start-up. In addition, as many as six utility models have been adopted around the door, and the cassette half is firmly fixed by minimizing play (play), which has a positive effect on running performance.<br><br>Full logic control is adopted.<br><br>Equipped with Dolby C NR and ANRS (Dolby B NR) as noise reduction systems.<br>The Dolby C uses a 2-stage sliding band system, which changes the frequency of compression and expansion according to the signal level. The sliding band is effective in reducing bleeding and has excellent S / N ratio and transient characteristics when there is a signal.<br>The noise reduction band is wider than in the past over the middle and high frequency band to obtain a high noise reduction effect. It also has a function to improve the high-frequency linearity to further improve the high-frequency characteristics.<br>In addition, by adopting the newly developed Dolby C standard IC, operation is more stable and reliability is improved.<br><br>A combination head using a Super Excellence (SE) head for both the playback and recording heads is used.<br>With a 3-head configuration, the gap width of the recording head can be as large as 4 microns and the gap width of the reproducing head can be as small as 1 micron, and we have succeeded in obtaining flat frequency characteristics that extend well to high frequencies.<br>In addition to the two coil balanced winding of the reproducing head, which is advantageous for induction, the gap distance between the recording head and the reproducing head is set to 4.1 mm in order to eliminate mutual interference between the recording head and the reproducing head. In addition, a unique taper is added to the sliding surface of the tape to devise a shape that takes head touch into consideration, thereby reducing the contour of the low range.<br><br>A 2-gap ferrite head is used for the erasing head.<br><br>Equipped with a dot matrix 2-color FL12 segment digital peak meter.<br><br>Equipped with a music scan function.<br><br>Equipped with a rec mute mechanism.<br><br>It has a headphone linked playback volume.<br><br>Equipped with a timer standby mechanism and by connecting an optional timer, it is possible to record the absence and play the alarm clock.<br><br>Equipped with remote control terminal.</p>
