				<p class="detail">Full auto-player system with MC cartridge installed as standard.<br><br>It is equipped with a biotracer that controls all operations electronically by means of a microcomputer.<br>By electronically controlling all operations with a microcomputer that makes hundreds of logical decisions every one thousandth of a second, speed and position sensors, and linear motors, it is possible to limit the low-frequency resonance peak to less than 3 dB no matter what cartridge is used, to improve cross-modulation distortion and low-frequency crosstalk, and to trace even records with slight warpage.<br><br>The cartridge is equipped with an MC cartridge XL-333E with an air core 8 coil made of samarium-cobalt and with a replaceable needle.<br><br>It is equipped with a Lummus Straight Arm that brings out the goodness of the light needle pressure high compliance cartridge and makes use of the traceability of the biotracer.<br>In addition, in order to increase the rigidity of the arm pipe, the special aluminum alloy is tapered to increase the rigidity and suppress the influence of unwanted resonance.<br><br>The rotation system employs three stages : a linear BSL motor in which the brush and slot are removed from the DC motor to completely eliminate the cause of torque unevenness ; a magnet-disk speed detection in which the average value of the detection signal that is magnetized at high density on the turntable is detected by a multi-gap head to catch even small changes in rotation speed ; and a quartz lock in which accurate servo is achieved by utilizing the high oscillation accuracy of quartz crystal. These three stages achieve stable rotation.<br><br>It employs an electronic needle pressure application method in which the needle pressure can be adjusted by the volume controller on the panel, and the inside force cancel amount corresponding to the needle pressure can be set simultaneously.<br>As a result, the deviation of the proper needle pressure value due to the change of environmental temperature can be adjusted while listening to the playback sound.<br><br>In addition to the normal auto operation, the front panel controls manual-like operations such as up / down of the tone arm and start / stop of the turntable.<br><br>Strict queuing is possible without touching the arm.<br><br>Equipped with an opto-electronic disc size selector that automatically selects the size of the record and leads in the tone arm. This mechanism also serves as a protective function that the needle does not work when there is no record.<br><br>Equipped with a muting mechanism that eliminates the generation of noise when the record board and needle tip contact.<br><br>The cabinet uses SBMC with large internal loss to eliminate resonance.<br>We have also adopted a large insulator filled with a highly viscoelastic material.<br><br>By using the sync unit sold separately, it is possible to play sync with the cassette deck.</p>
