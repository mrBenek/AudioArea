				<p class="detail">This is the second generation cassette deck of the 480 series equipped with Dolby C Type NR, bias fine adjustment mechanism and LED peak level meter.<br><br>Unlike the high-end 482Z/481Z, the 480Z has a 2-head configuration.<br>Also, there are 2 kinds of color variations, black model and silver model.<br><br>As a noise reduction system, Dolby B type and C type are mounted.<br>The Dolby Dolby C-type is basically the same as that of the B-type. The Dolby C-type amplifies and records only the low level signal in the middle and high range of which hissing is a concern from the viewpoint of audibility, and returns it to the original level at the time of playback, thereby eliminating the hissing attached to the tape. The C-type is an extension of this, and achieves a total noise reduction of up to 20 dB by receiving 10 dB each from two noise reduction processors for the high-level stage and low-level stage.<br>Type C uses a sliding band method that varies the starting saturation according to the input level and frequency components to suppress the bleeding phenomenon. In addition, the spectral skewing circuit suppresses the recording saturation of high-frequency signals of 8 kHz or higher to prevent the degradation of autumn KARAS h-number characteristics and the modulation of low-frequency signals. The anti-frequency network circuit also suppresses the recording saturation caused by large instantaneous inputs.<br><br>A 2-head configuration is -head configuration.<br>The RP-9E SENDUST recording / reproducing head is used for the recording / reproducing head, and the core is not saturated even when a large bias current is applied, and a sharp critical zone is formed.<br>E-8L type erase head, same as 482Z/481Z, is used. Double gap type with ferrite core with excellent high-frequency characteristics and Sendust core with high magnetic flux density at the tip provides low loss and excellent erase effect.<br><br>The mechanism uses a frequency distributed double capstan system.<br>In this system, stable tape running and head touch are obtained by the double capstan system. Moreover, by changing the diameters of the two capstan and the flywheel, overlapping of flutter cycle is avoided, and overall wow and flutter characteristics are improved.<br>In addition, it is equipped with a tape pad lifter to prevent adverse effects due to uneven pad pressure.<br><br>A DC servo motor is used as the main motor.<br>This motor detects rotational speed rotational speed as a change in voltage and controls the rotational speed to an accurate value.<br><br>A resonance damping type chassis is used for the chassis. Aluminum alloy, which has a larger damping characteristic than iron, is used, and resin is outsold to absorb microvibrations harmful to sound and prevent resonance.<br><br>C-MOS logic control is adopted for the operation system.<br>In this system, when the self-locking control button is pressed, the control circuit is activated and motor commands are issued to drive the mechanism. By using a cam driven by a motor instead of a solenoid plunger, sound at the time of operation is reduced. Damage to tape and transport is reduced by soft tape touch. In addition, temperature rise and power consumption are reduced.<br><br>Logic control type soft touch button is used for the control part.<br>It also simplifies operations and improves reliability by allowing you to move directly from rewind or fast forward to regenerating condition without having to go through the stop button.<br><br>Equipped with a bias fine tuning mechanism.<br>This takes into account the slight difference in the optimum bias value even for tapes in the same position. The 480Z adjusts the recorded and reproduced sound by repeating the recording and reproduction so that the sound becomes close to the sound quality of the original music source.<br>The variable range of the bias current is ± 10% from the center click position.<br><br>Equipped with a wide-range LED peak level meter for level display during recording and playback, it can display 50 dB of -40dB to + 10 dB in 16 segments.<br><br>Equipped with a timer recording and playback mechanism. By using a general audio timer, it is possible to record your absence and play an alarm clock.<br><br>Built-in MPX filter.<br><br>Equipped with a high-output headphone port.<br>In addition, it is equipped with a 2-level switch for headphone amplifier.<br><br>Equipped with a tape start memory function.<br><br>Remote Control Unit RM-100 (sold separately) can be used.</p>
