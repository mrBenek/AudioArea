				<p class="detail">Equipped with Distortion Shaper ZDII, this is a CD-player with improved musical expression.<br><br>It is equipped with a distortion shaper ZDII with a highly pure dither method. By using a high-frequency concentrated dither, the dither signal is pushed out of the audible band. Moreover, by a 16-bit 4-DAC balanced configuration, S/N is improved and a low distortion factor is achieved.<br>In addition, the built-in digital phase synchronization circuit cancels jitter up to ± 8 clocks to ensure accuracy in time axis direction.<br><br>The digital filter is equipped with an 18-bit 8 x oversampling digital filter.<br>As a result, a low-order filter with a gentle cutoff characteristic can be used, and the group delay characteristic is also greatly improved.<br><br>Weight balance is achieved by laying out the entire CD mechanism at the center of the body.<br>In addition, by installing a sub-chassis on the bottom chassis and floating it with a special anti-vibration material, the effect of the mechanical system due to the vibration of the main body of the transformer and the effect of the vibration of the CD mechanical part on the transformer are eliminated simultaneously.<br>A special glass fiber with low vibration mode is used for the mechanical base, and it is supported by 3 points which are strong against torsion. In addition, the ideal chassis balance is ensured by making the center of the chassis mass close to the heavyweight parts.<br><br>In order to eliminate vibration and resonance as much as possible, aluminum pull-out material with sufficient thickness and weight is adopted for the casing, and this is joined to the bonnet of thick steel plate treated with vinyl chloride as a double structure.<br>In addition, the design is flush surface to cope with air vibration from 360 degrees in front, back, left and right. In the front panel, only necessary keys are arranged to minimize the opening as much as possible to eliminate the effect of sound pressure.<br>In addition, a special steel damper material is attached to the bonnet top plate to increase the rigidity.<br><br>In order to prevent the servo circuit that controls the motion of the pickup from adversely affecting the analog system, the drive voltage to the actuator is filtered using a low-pass filter unnecessary noise components other than the servo current.<br><br>The pickup section is equipped with TFHS (Track Focus Holding System).<br>When there is a scratch or dirt on the disk surface, the tracking error signal (up / down) and focus error signal (left / right) are accurately read, and the trace signal immediately before the scratch or dirt is retained by the pickup. This mechanism starts reading the pits of the same track immediately after the scratch or dirt passes, preventing unpleasant audio skipping and ensuring stable pickup performance even against black dots.<br><br>Equipped with a high-precision electric output volume that can be operated by remote control.<br><br>It is equipped with a time edit function. When you do tape dubbing, you just enter the length of the tape and it will automatically program the music that goes into A side and B side.<br><br>By connecting a cable (sold separately) to the TEAC cassette deck, synchronized dubbing of CD and cassette is possible.<br>You just need to press the sink button on the deck side for the operation, and you can easily edit the tape.<br><br>You can perform operations such as random memory program of up to 20 songs, Delhi and program, music skip, cue lock, 4-mode repeat performance, 3-mode time counter, autospace, index search, and music search.<br>It also has a display ON/OFF function and timer play function.<br><br>A remote control is included.</p>
