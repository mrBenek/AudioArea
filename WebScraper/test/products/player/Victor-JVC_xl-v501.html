				<p class="detail">A CD player using Optica link and optical transmission system.<br><br>The Optica Link optical transmission system is used. The digital part of the pickup, servo system and signal processing system is completely electrically separated from the audio part of the digital filter, D/A converter and low-pass filter, and the signal is transmitted only by the photocoupler.<br>The photocoupler consists of a light-emitting element and a light-receiving element, which are insulated with a special film and sealed with epoxy. It also shows excellent characteristics in terms of leakage current and high-voltage insulation, so it blocks the noise of digital circuits that used to flow into analog circuits through power lines and ground lines.<br><br>High-precision 3-beam pickup is used for the pickup part.<br>In this pickup, the response speed is improved by shortening the distance between the main beam which reads the signal from the disk and the two servo beams. In addition, the XL-V501 pickup is lighter in weight to realize further improvement of the response. This reduces the excess servo current and reduces noise generation in the servo system.<br><br>In order to eliminate unnecessary vibration and resonance that degrade sound quality, Victor&#39;s original IS mechanism is adopted.<br>In this structure, the disk drive system and the pickup system, which are susceptible to adverse effects, are set on the damping material base with large internal loss, and are floating mounted with insulation rubber to block sound pressure and external vibration from the speakers.<br><br>The digital circuit employs a digital filter that doubles the sampling frequency to reduce the effect on the audio band, while the XL-V501 employs a newly developed high-order digital filter that has excellent cutoff characteristics for unwanted bands, improving attenuation by approximately 30 dB at 24.1 kHz, near the audible band.<br><br>In order to prevent the center of gravity of the chassis from being shifted to the disk drive system and the pickup system, a lattice-like radial base with a vibration control structure is installed on the audio board side. This protects the analog circuit from vibration and realizes low center of gravity and center weight balance.<br><br>It is equipped with an editing function and can be programmed automatically by setting the time of the tape when recording on the tape.<br><br>There are two types of output terminals, fixed and variable. Gold-plated.<br><br>It uses a motor drive type volume and can be operated from a remote control.<br><br>It is equipped with functions such as program and random play of up to 32 songs and 5 kinds of repeat.<br>In addition, it is equipped with an intro-scan function that plays the head of a song approximately 15 seconds at a time.<br><br>Equipped with a synchro terminal, editing and recording is possible in conjunction with JVC&#39;s synchro-compatible cassette decks.<br><br>Equipped with a large FL display.<br><br>It is also compatible with Emphasis Disc, and appears on the FL display during playback.<br><br>Built-in timer standby mechanism allows playback to start at desired time by combining with an optional timer.<br><br>Multi-functional remote control is included.</p>
