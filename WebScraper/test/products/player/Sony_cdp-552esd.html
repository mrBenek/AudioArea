				<p class="detail">A CD player based on CDP-502ES with added digital output and insulator.<br><br>The digital audio interface outputs enable transmission over a single digital cable along with signals such as emphasis ON/OFF, sub-code, and synchronization signals applying Phase Double Mark (biphasemark) modulation based on the standard format of the CD-standard.<br>This completely separates the CD&#39;s rotating machinery from the audio circuit, making the delicate audio circuit less susceptible to mechanical vibration of the rotating machinery and to noise from digital and servo circuits.<br>In addition, a pin jack is used for the output terminal, and an isolation pulse transformer is used for the signal output part with a sealed electromagnetic shield structure to separate the ground line.<br><br>The Unilinear converter system is used in the digital section to perform digital signal processing by fully synchronizing circuits such as D/A converters, digital filters, and EFM de-modulators with a single master clock. This eliminates in principle beat generation due to interference between two or more clocks.<br>In addition, the EFM de-modulator, which used to be three chips, has been integrated into one chip, resulting in a simpler structure.<br><br>The CDP 552 esd is equipped with a digital filter that oversamples the digital signal before D/A conversion to increase the frequency band distance between the unwanted component and the music signal.<br>Furthermore, since the ripple characteristic in the audio band is less than 0.01 dB and the attenuation in the stopband is 80 dB, the attenuation characteristic of the low-pass filter after D/A conversion can be made smooth and good phase characteristics can be obtained.<br><br>In order to realize simple and straight transmission, the rotary system, digital circuit, and analog circuit are completely separated. In addition, the position of the mounting screw is also examined repeatedly, and the internal layout is designed with structural rigidity in mind.<br>As a result, resonance, which affects sound quality, is suppressed in various details.<br>In addition, the audio circuit is a twin-mono configuration with Lch and Rch separation by bus bar, and a 7th-order GIC (Generalized Impedance Converter) low-pass filter is adopted, in which the music signal passes only through the resistance of the series arm of the filter.<br><br>In the power supply section, a large 35 VA transformer with more than double allowance in actual use is used. The power transformer consists of an OFC winding, an OFC lead wire, and a Z-material core. In addition, the power transformer is separated into three windings for analog circuits, digital &amp; servo, and display to reduce mutual interference.<br>The rectifier diode also uses an ultrafast recovery diode with a recovery time of 35 nsec and a rating of 10A with a margin.<br>In addition, the analog power supply circuit is composed of a discrete high-speed stabilized power supply, and a large electrolytic capacitor using ceramic powder and a tantalum capacitor with excellent high-frequency characteristics for bypassing between the power supply and the earth ground are used to enhance the supply capability and response of the power supply section for signals.<br><br>We put in a lot of carefully selected parts.<br>Starting with a copper-plated chassis that greatly eliminates magnetic distortion, the amplifier section is equipped with a high-quality operational amplifier. In addition, a mold-type non-inductive styrene capacitor is used for the integration circuit, a composite capacitor with non-inductive electrodes made of polystyrene and polypropylene derivatives for the emphasis time constant, and an LC (linear crystal) -OFC is used for the wires for audio signals. The crystals of Type 1 oxygen-free copper (purity of 99.995% or more) are enlarged and the number of crystal boundaries is reduced to reduce sound quality degradation due to capacitive reactances.<br>In addition, as for the resistance, we use many kinds of metal film resistance with a tolerance of 1% or less by applying non-magnetic coating to the OFC lead wire of the copper cap, and also use the line-out volume with carefully examined terminal material.<br><br>It uses a linear motor tracking mechanism that integrates a linear motor and an optical block, which is also used for professionals. It enables high-speed access with a selection time of approximately one second from the first song on the disc to the start of the last song.<br>In addition, there is almost no mechanical noise and reliability and durability are greatly improved by the integrated structure of drive type and optical system without transmission mechanism such as gear.<br>In addition, the entire mechanical block has a floating structure to suppress external vibration.<br><br>Four high-rigidity large insulators are included to ensure vibration prevention.<br><br>Equipped with a music calendar that directly displays the track number of up to 20 songs on the disc.<br><br>It is equipped with RMS (Random Music Sensor) function of up to 20 songs which can be added or changed even while playing.<br><br>Equipped with functions such as one touch direct selection and shuffle play with 20 keys, repeat between one song / all songs / A and B parts, AM (Automatic Music Sensor) function that allows you to easily find the beginning of a song you want to listen to, music search function that allows you to fast forward / rewind while listening to a song, and index search function.<br><br>It employs a push-loading linear skating system that closes even when the disk table is pushed, further increasing the operating speed.<br><br>It is also equipped with an auto-space play function that automatically sets the interval between songs to 3 seconds during program performance and shuffle play, and an auto-delay function that creates a 2-second blank before the start of performance when directly selecting channels.<br><br>Equipped with two output terminals, variable and fixed.<br><br>Equipped with a timer standby switch and an accessory terminal designed to improve the system.<br><br>Wireless remote controller RM-D502 is included.</p>
