				<p class="detail">In addition to the basic performance inherited from high-end machines, this CD player features unique to CD players.<br><br>The digital filter uses a 4 x oversampling digital filter.<br>By digital processing, the signal sampled at a sampling frequency of 44.1 kHz is raised to 176.4 kHz by a factor of four, and unwanted folded noise around 44.1 kHz is removed. This allows the use of a low-pass filter with a loose characteristic, and realizes low-distortion audio characteristics with little phase rotation up to high frequencies.<br><br>The D/A converter uses a glitch less type twin D/A converter.<br>This eliminates the need for a deglitch circuit and enables a simple circuit configuration. Moreover, by adopting a twin configuration in which the left and right signals are independent, channel separation and phase shift in the high frequency range of the left and right signals are improved.<br><br>When a pit signal is read by a laser beam, the phase difference between the four photodetectors is eliminated and a high-output RF signal can be obtained by using an Accu-focus system.<br><br>The shape and characteristics of the pickup body have been improved through repeated analysis of polymer materials using a large computer and implementation simulation.<br>In addition, the photodetector part has been improved, and six buffer amplifiers are built in to greatly reduce the influence of external noise and improve S/N.<br><br>In addition to the servo, digital and audio systems, and FL display systems, the power supply uses a bifilar transformer with a separate winding for the D/A converter to prevent mutual interference.<br><br>It adopts a floating structure in which the optical system mechanism is lifted from the chassis.<br>In addition, we have developed a ballast base that reduces unstable lateral vibration by lowering the center of gravity of the mechanical chassis below the support part of the mechanism, and by fixing it on a ceramic mechanical support with excellent vibration damping characteristics, we have achieved stable signal reading.<br><br>In order to reduce unnecessary vibration of the disk, Pioneer has further improved its original disc stabilizer and adopted a magnet clamp that enables the disc stabilizer and disc table to be firmly fixed by the attraction force of a magnet.<br>This new mechanism allows the disc to rotate without contact between the stabilizer and the clamper arm supporting the stabilizer. This greatly reduces the vibration generated during disc rotation.<br><br>The chassis uses a honeycomb chassis with structural strength increased by honeycomb ribs. In addition, copper plating is applied to reduce unnecessary vibration and magnetic strain.<br><br>It is equipped with an auto program edit function that allows the microcomputer to determine the maximum number of songs that can be played in full within a given time by indicating the number of songs that you want to start listening to and the time of the tape to be used, and automatically programs the music.<br>In addition, it is equipped with a time fade edit function which is an advanced version of auto program edit. When you specify the desired time, it automatically fades out and enters a pause state.<br><br>Equipped with a music window function, you can take out your favorite phrases or only the parts you need from a song and play it continuously by connecting up to 8 phrases. The seam fades in and out.<br><br>Equipped with one touch fade function.<br>We have developed and adopted a digital attenuator IC for volume control.<br><br>It has a digital level control function that can adjust the volume with a remote control.<br><br>Equipped with a power on start function that enables timer start.</p>
