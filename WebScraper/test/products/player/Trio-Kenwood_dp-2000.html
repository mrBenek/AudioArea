				<p class="detail">A CD player that pursues audio in an orthodox way.<br><br>The mechanism section is equipped with an eccentric absorption mechanism unique to Kenwood. By setting the disk at the rotation center point, the bare nature of the mechanism is improved, and the reading accuracy is improved without extra burden on the servo.<br>The DP-2000 has an eccentric absorption mechanism that keeps the disk level by placing a ring-shaped magnet on the disk clamper and uniformly mounting the disk. Also, a center guide made of brass is used around the Center shaft. This center guide has a structure that floats and sinks by a compression coil spring, so it floats when playing a disk with a large center hole, and sinks when playing a disk with a small center hole.<br>This eccentric absorption mechanism clamps the disk firmly as a highly rigid rotation mechanism, so that the disk can be rotated while maintaining the rotation center point at all times, improving the reading accuracy.<br><br>Optimal servocontrol is used for the servo circuit.<br>This circuit automatically detects scratches or dust on the disc, controls the servo amount from just before the scratch, and returns to the original servo amount when the disc passes through the defective part. Therefore, the RF signal of the disc is reproduced accurately with almost no tracking error.<br><br>The output stage employs a twin output configuration using a cascade feedback amplifier to eliminate interference between the left and right channels to obtain a low distortion factor and high separation. The low-pass filter employs a newly developed in-house filter with improved performance using a discrete configuration to obtain excellent characteristics with a distortion factor less than the measurement limit.<br><br>It is equipped with a FIR (Finite Impulse Response) type digital filter excellent in unwanted band cut-off characteristics and in-band ripple characteristics.<br>In the digital data stage of this filter, unnecessary bands from 24.1 kHz to 64.1 kHz are cut off by more than 80 dB. Therefore, the order of the analog filter in the latter stage can be reduced, and group delay characteristics that are easily disturbed are greatly improved.<br>In addition, the D/A converter is equipped with a cascade amplifier feedback circuit to greatly improve the distortion factor and SN ratio.<br><br>The Unilinear converter system fully synchronizes all digital processing sections of the digital signal processing section, digital filter and D/A converter with one type of clock.<br>The D/A converter block is a 16-bit integration type with a constant current drive circuit for integration.<br><br>A newly developed insulator is used for the leg part to suppress external vibration and reduce unnecessary burden on the servo circuit.<br><br>The power supply section employs a 2-transformer 4-winding 11-power supply configuration to eliminate mutual interference through the power supply.<br>In addition, the D/A converter block is more focused and is supported by two shunt regulators and four series regulators powered.<br><br>Uses a 4-pole 5-slot large torque motor with less cogging for disk rotation and pickup feed.<br>This motor achieves sharp rotation with less eccentricity by improving axial performance.<br><br>The pickup section uses a 3-beam type pickup in which 3 beams are applied obliquely to the track direction.<br>In this method, the signal is read by the center beam, and the track offset is detected in real time by the two ends. In addition, the vibration characteristics of the actuator that moves the objective lens are improved to realize high-precision tracing.<br><br>In order to enjoy CD in positive phase, it is equipped with an invert output which can invert the phase by 180 °.<br>This function inverts the phase of the music signal at the stage of digital data, so there is no degradation of sound quality.<br><br>Subcode output terminal is mounted.<br><br>It is equipped with functions such as manual search, jump selection, random play of up to 16 songs, memory repeat of a specific section, reservation of the next song with reserve key, space creation for about 4 seconds with space key, auto pause, and memory repeat of all songs.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
