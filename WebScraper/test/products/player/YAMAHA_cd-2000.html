				<p class="detail">A CD player developed as a reference machine for a new era.<br><br>We have adopted a newly designed LSI that is finer than before and has increased the circuit integration by adopting the 2 μ m rule.<br>The signal processing LSI with built-in digital filter is an N-MOS type, and has a structure that integrates various digital signal processing including interleave demodulation, error detection and error correction.<br>The servocontrol LSI is a C-MOS type that enables high-speed processing and low power consumption. It performs signal processing such as demodulation of EFM signals and sub-codes as well as various servocontrol including optical heads, and eliminates the influence of disturbance and provides highly reliable disk control.<br><br>The CD 2000 does not use a digital filter built into the LSI. Instead, it is equipped with a high-precision double oversampling digital filter that is independent on the left and right sides. This reduces the ripple to less than ± 0.00025 dB and the residual component to less than -90dB, thus reducing the generation of echo that dulls sound in response to pulsed input.<br>The analog low-pass filter is composed of a 5th-order Butterworth type active filter, which suppresses abrupt changes in phase characteristics and acquires simple characteristics. The analog low-pass filter is also made with carefully selected high-quality capacitors.<br><br>The actuator of the optical head has a structure in which the springs in both the focusing direction and the tracking direction are arranged in a cross configuration to block small vibrations.<br>In addition, the spherical objective lens, combined with the 3-beam system, which boasts a tracing capability of ± 0.2 micron accuracy, enhances data reading capability.<br><br>In order to prevent adverse effects on the audio circuit caused by minute vibrations generated from the optical head &amp; motor and power supply, the VM-stabilizer developed by the original VMA (vibration modulation analysis method) is mounted.<br>The VM stabilizer securely fixes the audio circuit of the PC board to prevent vibration from the drive mechanism and power transformer from entering the audio circuit. The VM stabilizer covers the back of the audio board to shield it from noise propagating through the space.<br><br>In order to increase the rigidity of the housing, we have adopted a double-bottom structure consisting of a plate on the base plate and another plate on the base plate. In addition to the plate on the base plate, we have adopted a large heavy insulator with additional weight on the four legs.<br><br>The power supply is equipped with a large power transformer, a large audio capacitor, and a bus bar and power jumper cord to provide a strong, low-impedance power supply.<br><br>Uses a 6-digit FL tube display.<br><br>Equipped with two output terminals, fixed and variable.<br><br>There were 2 types, the black model CD-2000 and the gorgeous version CD-2000W with silver hairline finish front panel and mirror finished real walnut.<br>It also comes with a wireless remote control for each color.</p>
