				<p class="detail">A record player that pursues high dimensional sound quality with the UR method (Ultimate Refining Method).<br><br>The UR method takes note of the fact that sound changes depending on the parts and materials that make up every part. It is an approach to control vibration modes by suppressing micro-vibrations below the level of human hearing. This further enhances sound perfection.<br><br>To achieve more stable rotation, the drive system of the YP-D10 consists of three stages : a quartz PLL servo for low frequency disturbance, a large inertia of a heavy turntable for high frequency disturbance, and an FG servo for medium frequency disturbance.<br><br>The motor has a large torque of 1.2 kg ・ cm and uses a DC motor with excellent bare characteristics. In addition, the rotational speed is controlled by the double servo system of the FG (frequency generator) servo system and the quartz PLL (phase locked loop) servo system to obtain high rotational accuracy.<br>In the FG servo system, a rotational speed detector (FG) detects a signal from the FG that generates a frequency proportional to the rotational speed of the turntable and controls the rotational speed of the turntable so that the frequency of the signal becomes constant.<br>The quartz PLL servo system was introduced to further improve the rotational accuracy of the FG servo system. This system controls the frequency of the output signal from the FG and the reference signal oscillated by the crystal oscillator to eliminate the phase shift. The rotational accuracy can be improved to the oscillation frequency accuracy of the crystal. The rotational accuracy when this quartz PLL is applied is within ± 20 ppm including temperature drift.<br><br>The turntable is made of aluminum die cast with a diameter of 31 cm and has a precise dynamic balance from the molding stage. In addition, it is designed to move the mass to the outer circumference and has an inertial mass of 350 kg ・ cm.<sup>2</sup>It is improved against load variations at high frequencies where the quartz PLL becomes ineffective.<br><br>The power supply section uses a strong one that maintains a constant voltage of 24 V even when a current of 1100 mA is taken out to obtain an accurate response to load fluctuations.<br><br>The tone arm is a gimbal support system with a pivot made of polished chromium molybdenum steel. It has an initial motion sensitivity of 3 mg vertically and 5 mg horizontally. The arm body is an S-shaped pipe arm made of a special aluminum alloy that has more than twice the strength and hardness of pure aluminum. The pipe is filled with a filler to suppress resonance.<br>The inside force canceler is a roller string and counterweight type, and highly adjustable.<br>The head shell is made of high rigidity special aluminum alloy die-cast to reduce the total weight of the tone arm and prevent resonance.<br>In addition, an extremely thin and flexible special lead wire is used for the lead wire to increase the sensitivity of the arm.<br><br>Since a NEGLEX low-impedance cable is used for the pickup cable, the resistance value from the cartridge to the pin plug is 0.94 Ω, which is less than 2/3 of the conventional value.<br>Also, the plug is gold-plated.<br><br>Equipped with 6 mm stroke elevation ring rotary arm height adjustment mechanism so that commercially available cartridges can be used. Up and down of 1 mm is possible with one rotation of the ring.<br><br>The cabinet is not a box but a solid type with 64 mm thick laminated high-density particleboards to reduce the adverse effects of vibration. In addition, a 1.6 mm thick steel plate is used for the back plate to prevent howling. It also protects against unwanted radiation from crystal oscillator circuits and logic circuits.<br>The arm stand and arm base are made of 1 kg zinc die cast and are fixed to the cabinet. In addition, the arm support is fixed by tightening it with a surface like a vise, and unnecessary vibration is suppressed by fixing the root of the arm sufficiently.<br>In addition, a large double damping type insulator has been adopted in consideration of the material.<br><br>It is equipped with a silent ending mechanism. When a recording is finished and the needle tip of the cartridge enters the final sound groove, the queuing lever automatically operates to quietly raise the cartridge from the recording surface and turn the power off.<br>This mechanism uses a photoelectric detector to detect the moving speed of the shutter attached to the lower part of the tone arm and drives an electromagnetic solenoid to operate the queuing lever and power switch. This mechanism does not impose any load on the arm movement and does not cause any malfunction.<br><br>Finished with ebony decorative urethane open-pore finish.</p>
