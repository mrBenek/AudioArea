				<p class="detail">CD player with 4DAC 20-bit system.<br><br>The D/A converter uses a 4DAC linear 20-bit system with greatly improved reproducibility of small signals.<br>This circuit employs a 4 dac configuration that uses a D/A converter for the positive signal and a D/A converter for the negative signal for Lch and Rch, respectively. Each component is individually D/A converted and synthesized by a differential amplifier. The problem of 0 cross distortion due to the difference in level at the 0 cross point is solved in principle by distinguishing between the positive signal and the negative signal and switching operation by a 4 dac processor LSI.<br><br>The digital filter that removes unwanted high-frequency components from the input signal from the CD employs a high-precision 20-bit 8-times oversampling digital filter that separates the signal level from the conventional 16-bit (65536 levels) to 20-bit (1048576 levels) to minimize conversion errors when small signals are input. High-density data is sent to the D/A converter.<br>In addition, the use of a low-order analog low-pass filter significantly reduces the adverse effects of group delay distortion and distortion caused by the elements and semiconductors that compose the low-pass filter.<br><br>A silent deglitch circuit is mounted to improve the S/N ratio for small signals.<br>By fixing the deglitch circuit (sample-and-hold circuit), which removes the glitch noise generated during bit switching of the D/A converter, in the sample mode when a small signal is generated (-12dB or less), the problem of switching noise generated by the deglitch circuit itself, which prevents the reproduction of small signal, is solved.<br><br>The sample-and-hold circuit, buffer amplifier -hold circuit, buffer amplifier and headphone amplifier. classAA<br>In classAA, voltage control and current drive, which were conventionally performed by a single amplifier, are shared by two different amplifiers. By enabling faithful waveform transmission that is less affected by load, low distortion and high resolution in the mid-range and high range are achieved.<br><br>8-sample linear interpolation is installed as a countermeasure against data errors caused by scratches or dirt on the disk signal surface.<br>When a data error occurs in a conventional CD player due to scratches or dirt on the disc signal surface, the signal processing LSI shifts the signal processing in the order of error correction → average value interpolation → previous value hold according to the error amount.<br>In the 8-sample linear interpolation, noise generation is prevented by linear interpolation without going to the previous value hold when the data error is within 8 consecutive data errors.<br><br>The power supply circuit employs a discrete low-noise active servo power supply, which realizes low noise, low impedance, and high ripple rejection of the audio power supply, enabling faithful feedback of small fluctuations in the power supply voltage, thereby suppressing fluctuations in the power supply voltage caused by DAC operation.<br><br>Equipped with an optical digital output terminal.<br><br>The parts that make up the audio circuit are selected after careful consideration of both physical characteristics and listening tests.<br>The rectifier circuit uses a fast recovery diode and a high-capacity audio electrolytic capacitor to reduce rectification noise. The audio ground is equipped with an independent bus bar for Lch and Rch to reduce impedance of the ground line.<br>In addition, a newly developed high-sound carbon film resistor using a non-magnetic cap is used for the resistor, and a high-sound electrolytic capacitor is used for the capacitor to improve musical performance as well as low distortion and transparency.<br><br>A multi-layer structure base made of different materials such as metal chassis base and TNRC (Technics, Non-Resonance Compound) base is adopted for the sound pressure vibration transmitted from the speakers, and high vibration damping effect is realized by converting vibration energy into thermal energy.<br>In addition, for floor vibration transmitted from the installation platform, four large insulators block vibration transmitted to the player body, and the optical deck is made into a multiple insulator structure in which the optical deck is double-floated on top of that, and large vibration damping is achieved.<br><br>A high-speed linear access system using a high-precision linear motor is high-speed linear access system using a high-precision linear motor. High-speed access is realized by polishing the original control system using a microcomputer, and high durability and quietness are acquired as well as improved operability.<br><br>The pickup uses a unique single-beam system with high laser light utilization efficiency and greatly improved SN ratio of the reproduced signal. In addition, the CCF lens of this laser pickup uses a unique aspherical integrally molded glass lens, providing excellent signal reading ability and high reliability that is resistant to scratches and dirt on the disk surface.<br><br>It is equipped with an edit guide function. When recording or editing from a CD to a tape, simply select the length of the tape to be used (90 minutes, 60 minutes, 46 minutes). The number of songs, the number of songs, and the remaining time that can be recorded on the A side and B side of the tape are automatically calculated and displayed simultaneously on the Semi Dual Music Matrix Display (the remaining time is displayed by switching). The length of the tape to be recorded can be selected using the editing key or can be set freely from 1 minute to 99 minutes using the 20 key. In addition, the auto space can be ON/OFF.<br><br>Equipped with a disk link function, the number of songs, number of songs and remaining time that can be recorded from other disks can be automatically calculated and displayed on the remaining part of the tape recorded from the first disk.<br><br>It is equipped with an auto-peak search function that automatically detects the peak level of all songs on the disc or program songs, and then repeats playback for approximately 3 seconds before and after the peak point, for a total of approximately 6 seconds. This function allows you to easily set the recording level at the deck.<br>In addition, it is equipped with AB peak search which enables high-precision peak search of any two points (A-B) section in the play state.<br><br>Equipped with shuttle search, it can search at four speeds in both forward and reverse directions, from 1/8 times to 76 times depending on the angle of the dial.<br><br>It is equipped with a window repeat playback function, and you can repeat playback while producing the phrase sound of the pause position in the pause state. You can choose between narrow (approx. 0.2 seconds) and wide (approx. 1 second) playback duration.<br><br>Equipped with an Lch/Rch independent digital level meter and a display that can display the playing position by switching.<br><br>Equipped with direct access function by 20 keys.<br><br>It is equipped with functions such as 32-step random program, random play, repeat, A-B repeat, auto queue, etc.<br><br>Equipped with 2 mode timer play function of normal and random.<br><br>Equipped with 4-mode switching system time display function.<br><br>Display can be turned ON/OFF.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
