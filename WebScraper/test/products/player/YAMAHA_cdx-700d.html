				<p class="detail">A CD player equipped with a high-bit digital filter or a glitch less D/A converter.<br><br>Equipped with 4 x oversampling high-bit digital filter.<br>By high-precision digital operation with 225 + 41 operation degree and coefficient word length up to 32 bits, noise and ripple are suppressed to 16 bit resolution level or less as a characteristic of the filter itself. Out-of-band noise is less than -100dB, and in-band ripple is within ± 0.0001 dB.<br><br>The D/A converter is equipped with a glitch less high-speed D/A converter that uses high-speed serial processing to eliminate harmful glitch noise.<br><br>Design Rule It is equipped with Yamaha&#39;s original newly developed signal processing CD LSI using a small flat package of 2 μ m in size. By integrating signal processing and servo circuit control into one chip, peripheral parts are greatly reduced. This not only simplifies the circuit, but also realizes low power consumption and low noise.<br><br>Equipped with 75 Ω coaxial type digital output terminal.<br>An on / off switch is also provided at the digital out terminal on the rear panel.<br><br>The optical head uses a 3-beam system that detects track misalignment in real time with the front and rear beams in addition to the main beam.<br>The optical head mechanism has a floating structure to eliminate the unstable operation of the optical head due to external vibration and the influence of the vibration of the optical head on the audio part.<br><br>The low-pass filter of the audio section is a third active type.<br>By setting the cutoff frequency higher than 20 kHz, the upper limit of the audio band, the group delay time within the band is kept constant and the audio signal is extracted clearly.<br><br>The power supply section uses an electrolytic capacitor for audio equipment.<br><br>Equipped with an 8-digit FL display with calendar function.<br><br>It is equipped with a 24 song random program function that can pick up up to 24 songs from the disc, rearrange them in the order of preference and play them.<br><br>It is equipped with a delete program function that can cut and play back songs you don&#39;t want to listen to.<br><br>It has a random play function.<br><br>Equipped with a repeat function that allows you to select one song, all songs, program songs, or between A and B.<br><br>Equipped with an index search.<br><br>It is equipped with a space insert function that can set a space between songs of approximately 4 seconds.<br><br>2-speed monitor search is adopted, and fast forward and fast backward are performed at low speed at first, and then fast forward and fast backward are performed by switching to high speed.<br><br>Equipped with a headphone port with volume.<br><br>Equipped with a timer play function that can be combined with an external timer for playback.<br><br>Wireless remote control with 24 keys is included.<br>This remote control is of the full mode specification perform almost all operations such as program operation and opening and closing of tray.</p>
