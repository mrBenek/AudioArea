				<p class="detail">A universal player developed as a reference player that brings out the potential of DVD audio to the maximum.<br><br>For the D/A conversion, a 192 kHz / 24-bit D/A converter developed jointly with Barr Brown is used for all channels. For the two main channels, two 192 kHz / 24-bit D/A converters are used as differential mode to reduce common-mode noise by mutually canceling each other.<br>A digital filter compatible with the 192 kHz high-sampling frequency of DVD audio was jointly developed with NPC and incorporated into the digital filter.<br><br>In order to achieve high sound quality, it is equipped with a pure audio clock reference function that switches the crystal oscillator according to the sampling frequency of the disc to be reproduced.<br>The crystal oscillator is switched between 44.1 kHz (44.1 kHz, 88.2 kHz, 176.4 kHz) and 48 kHz (48 kHz, 96 kHz, 192 kHz), and the non-selected oscillator is turned off to supply an accurate clock and improve sound quality.<br><br>It is equipped with a CD Digital Direct function that transmits the CD via the shortest path without going through the DSP section when playing back the CD, preventing signal degradation completely.<br><br>The power supply section uses an R-core power transformer for audio circuits. In addition, the layout is completely separate from the power supply section so that noise from servo circuits and digital circuits does not interfere with the audio section.<br>The R-core transformer is characterized by low leakage flux, which is a source of noise in the player.<br><br>High-bit ICs are used for all audio channels. Using a unique algorithm developed from wide-range technology, the smooth waveform of the original sound of digital signals recorded with 16 bits of quantization is estimated and re-quantized to 24 bits.<br><br>A low-impedance PX capacitor is used in the main unit of the digital section to reproduce clear, flexible, and high sound.<br>In addition, a custom-designed power capacitor with thorough anti-noise measures is installed to eliminate minute noise from the power line.<br><br>The video off function (Auto/on/off) is used to turn off the power and ground of the video circuit during non-visual source playback. By this function, fine noise generated by the video circuit is eliminated, and high sound quality playback is achieved.<br>In addition, the multi-channel off function automatically cuts the power and ground of the multi-channel circuit when two channels are played back, and the digital out off function automatically cuts the power and ground of the digital out section.<br><br>A built-in Dolby Digital or DTS sound decoder can process discrete 5.1 ch audio for DVD video.<br><br>Equipped with a balanced output, a newly developed 192 kHz / 24-bit D/A converter is differentiated into two channels, L and R, to realize a truly balanced output terminal that is resistant to electrical noise.<br>The balance output off function also improves the sound quality of the pin jack.<br><br>In order to reduce the mutual electrical influence inside the player, each part is completely separated by copper plated steel plate, and the 3BOX-5CHAMBER structure is adopted which houses the main unit of the digital part in the shield case.<br><br>In order to suppress the influence of external vibration, a 6 mm thick metal plate with excellent rigidity is fixed to the chassis base to form a weight-class stable underbase. In addition, a 2 mm thick top plate is adopted and a metal inside plate is adopted inside.<br>In addition, solid brass is used for the insulator to prevent external vibration from the installation base.<br><br>By adopting an acoustic damper tray and double air-lock shield door in the transport section, high-precision signal reading and reduction of leakage of operation sound are realized.<br>In addition, a large disk clamper is installed for high sound and image quality, and operation with less jitter is realized.<br><br>It uses a high-precision 2-wavelength twin focus pickup that automatically switches the laser light.<br>This makes it compatible with DVD audio discs, as well as other recordable media and CD-Rs.<br><br>It also supports SACD playback, converting a 2.8 MHz DSD signal into a multi-bit signal with a high-precision digitization filter and D/A converting it.<br>In this configuration, the circuit blocks of DVD audio are shared as much as possible, and the configuration is simple. In addition, by processing everything in the digital stage, mutual interference of signals is suppressed and high sound quality is achieved.<br><br>Video film is usually 24 frames per second, and DVD-Video movie software is 24 frames per second, which is the same as this movie film. Information on all 525 scanning lines is written on one screen and stored on a disc.<br>In order to reproduce this progressive system image, it is equipped with 2-3 pull-down system &quot;Pure Cinema Progressive Scan Circuit&quot;.<br>For film materials such as motion picture software, frames are inserted into the original source based on 2-3 processing information in the telecine process to realize more natural and film-like progressive images. For video materials, &quot;motion adaptive complementary processing&quot; based on a unique algorithm realizes high-resolution and smooth images that cannot be achieved with conventional processing (when using a progressive scan compatible display).<br><br>The VQE3 video quality enhancer, designed by Pioneer, is used to realize high-precision and high-performance video signal processing.<br><br>Equipped with newly developed component component frame DNR / PRO. For discriminating between video signals and noise, appropriate parameters are set for each of the three signals of luminance [Y], color difference [Cb], and [Cr], which constitute the video, and noise is detected with high precision.<br><br>The video digital signal read from the disc is processed by a fine-focus digital filter built into the new video quality enhancer VQE3. By upsampling the 4 : 2 : 2 video signal recorded on the disc to a 4 : 4 : 4 signal with high precision, the resolution of the video signal is increased and noise is suppressed.<br><br>In addition to the existing &quot;YNR&quot;, &quot;CNR&quot; and &quot;Detail&quot; functions, new parameters such as &quot;Progressive Motion&quot; and &quot;White Level&quot; are incorporated into the image quality adjustment function.<br><br>It stores the image quality settings for 15 DVD discs in flash memory and automatically recalls the settings the next time the disc is played. It also features a 15-step forward / reverse trick play that includes smooth reverse playback at the same speed, a new GUI, program memory &amp; auto program play, resume function and quick start mechanism.<br><br>It comes with a multi-dial that integrates scanning, multi-speed, and jog operations during playback into one, and a remote control that realizes one hand operation by concentrating the joystick that is the key for GUI operation on the upper part of the remote control.<br>In addition, the basic operation buttons have a self-illumination function, making it easier to use in rooms with reduced lighting.</p>
