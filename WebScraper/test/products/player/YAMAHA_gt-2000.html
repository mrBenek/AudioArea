				<p class="detail">GT series record player developed under the design concept of Gigantic &amp; Tremendous.<br>Production was stopped once around 1989, but it was reprinted as a limited product in 1991.<br><br>A 374 mm diameter turntable manufactured by the hot forging method is used for the turntable.<br>In the hot forging method, aluminum refined to nearly 100% purity is heated to 500 to 700 degrees Celsius, compressed by a special high-pressure press machine, and then finished precisely by cutting and applying an alumite treatment that is less likely to cause scratches. In general die casting and forging methods, aluminum alloys containing copper and zinc are used as raw materials. These methods have drawbacks, such as the formation of internal cavities and the inability to maintain accurate dynamic balance. However, the hot forging method does not have such drawbacks, and it is equivalent to rationally realizing the cutting out of solid wood.<br>In addition, the GT-2000 has a large diameter of 374 mm to increase the moment of inertia. For the same weight, the larger diameter increases the moment of inertia, which is 1.2t ・ cm.<sup>2</sup>It has acquired a huge moment of inertia.<br><br>The motor uses a DC coreless hole motor with a starting torque of 2 kg ・ cm, which in principle does not cause cogging, etc., and drives the platter directly. In addition, the rotation accuracy is maintained at crystal level (20 ppm) squid by adopting quartz PLL.<br>The servo system has a positive and negative bidirectional servo system that can apply torque in the opposite direction during acceleration and deceleration. This servo system responds sharply to subtle load fluctuations and absorbs rotational unevenness.<br>We have adopted a 10 mm diameter shaft for the motor shaft.<br><br>The cabinet consists of five layers of high-density particleboards, one of which is a bottom plate and is 2.5 kg and 25 mm thick. The weight of the cabinet itself is 14.5 kg.<br><br>A spring / rubber compound type insulator with excellent vibration absorption is adopted in order to external vibration.<br>This is a combination of low-frequency vibration resistant spring and high-frequency vibration resistant rubber. It has excellent vibration isolation characteristics over the entire frequency range and is equipped with a height adjustment mechanism to keep the player level.<br><br>The dust cover uses an acrylic dust cover with 5 mm side and 4 mm other.<br><br>S-shaped long and light heavy arm is used for the tone arm.<br>The arm supports a virtual single-point support gimbal support system in which the pivot is received by an angular contact bearing which is supported by a rubber push for complete elimination of rattling and high sensitivity.<br>The arm part is an orthodox type that can be called a long and light heavy arm. Since it is a long arm, the waviness of the S-shape is minimized and the horizontal tracking error is also successfully suppressed within a narrow range.<br><br>Equipped with arm height adjustment mechanism from + 10 mm to -6mm.<br>The fixing system uses a three point support lock climate, and the shaft is a brass machined φ 27 mm with a scale of 1 mm.<br><br>The arm base is made of heavy weight zinc die-cast.<br><br>A thread suspension type anti-skating mechanism is adopted. In addition, a roller stand with rollers and thrust bearings is provided to reduce sliding friction of thread.<br><br>The head shell is machined from a pure aluminum block.<br>In order to secure the cartridge and prevent harmful vibration, the head shell is designed with a cartridge mounting section of 4 mm thick, a shorter overall length, and a connector holding section of extremely thick.<br><br>The pick-up cord uses NEGLEX 2496 low-impedance (130 pf, 350m Ω) double-cylindrical (26 - and 23-core) cables, and is connected to the tone arm at the shortest possible distance without cables running through the cabinet to minimize information loss and noise from internal leads.<br><br>The GT-2000 has the same birch makeup and black paint finish as the NS-1000M, and the GT-2000L has a walnut flat grain makeup finish.<br>In addition, Auto Lifter YAL-1 is YAL-1. 2000<br><br><br>As a separately sold option, the tone arm YSA-1 adopted in the GT-2000X and the straight arm YSA-2 produced in limited quantity can be equipped.<br><br>Anchor block YAB-1 can be used.<br>The YAB-1 is a set of two dumbbell weights connected by a horizontal bar. The weight of each set is 32 kg, and the weight of GT-2000 can be increased to 60 kg.<br>In addition, it comes with a spring-rubber compound foot with height adjustment mechanism that can be used by players other than GT series players.<br><br>The outer power supply YOP-1 can be used.<br>The YOP-1 is a dedicated external constant-voltage power supply unit with a capacity approximately 2.5 times that of the GT player&#39;s built-in power supply. The powerful power supply enhances the stability of the rotating system, and it can also be used as an electronic brake when stopping.<br><br>Disk stabilizer YDS-3 can be used.<br>The YDS-3 has a double structure consisting of a brass ground metal part and an African paddock wood part. You can enjoy the change of sound by using both parts separately.<br><br>74 mm φ x34mm aluminum / brass composite disk stabilizer YDS-8 can be used.<br><br>Pinpoint block YPB-1 can be used.<br>YPB-1 is a brass machined pinpoint block that can support GT players, speakers and amplifiers with points.<br><br>The Gun Metal Turntable YGT-1 can be used.<br>The inertia of YGT-1 is 3.6t ・ cm.<sup>2</sup>The gunmetal turntable allows you to further improve the rotational accuracy of the GT player.<br><br>Disk stabilizer YDS-1 can be used.<br>The YDS-1 is an electric pump type record adsorption system using a brass milling machine. In principle, it can exhibit the power equivalent to increasing the record weight to 4.5 kg.</p>
