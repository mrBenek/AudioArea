				<p class="detail">This is a stereo player system based on Exclusive P3 that aims for higher quality playback by changing the arm and details.<br><br>For the phono motor and bearing structure, we have adopted a quartz PLL control system for the linear torque type DD motor with slotless and coreless structure. In addition, we have adopted the SHR (Stable Hanging Rotor) bearing structure with the center of gravity of the rotating shaft set low. As a result, we have achieved rotational performance with rotational unevenness of 0.003% or less and rotational speed accuracy of 0.001%, which is impossible with conventional measurement methods.<br>In the SHR system, the bearing structure is designed to be the reverse structure of the conventional system. First, the supporting point is moved closer to the center of gravity and the conventional bearing section is changed to the rotating side, so that inertia is generated in the bearing section during rotation and lateral pressure is not applied to the shaft. To prevent rattling, the clearance of the bearing is kept to a minimum, and sufficient torque and turntable inertia are set for the load of the cartridge applied to the outer circumference of the turntable.<br><br>The high torque motor with dual rotor structure using anisotropic ferrite magnet with strong magnetic force realizes high torque (10kg-cm) similar to record cutting equipment.<br>In addition, an inertial mass of 700kg-cm<sup>2</sup>In combination with the turntable and servo circuit with excellent transient characteristics, excellent starting characteristics (constant speed rotation in 0.3 seconds after the switch is turned on) and load resistance characteristics (equivalent to needle pressure of 1.5 kg) are realized, and stable and high precision rotational characteristics are obtained.<br><br>The tone arm is equipped with a mass concentration system that concentrates the mass on the rotating shaft and an oil dump adjustment mechanism, in addition to the light equivalent mass of the tone arm.<br>By applying a highly reliable silicone oil brake on the arm shaft, the volume in the low range and the reduction of cross modulation distortion are realized. In addition, the amount of oil dump brake can be controlled according to the characteristics of the cartridge, and the dump can be turned off.<br><br>The tone arm is made of DRA &amp; alumina ceramics in pursuit of no resonance.<br>It is equipped with a new mechanism, Dynamic Resonance Absorber (DRA), which was developed based on computer analysis technology such as FFT analyzer to understand the vibration characteristics of the tone arm that degrade sound quality. The DRA is equipped with a sub-resonance body composed of a damper with moderate spring properties and a weight, and absorbs vibrations that are opposite to the resonance of the arm. This vibration neutralization function prevents the needle tip from picking up excess components other than the sound groove, and more accurate reproduced sound is obtained.<br>Alumina ceramic is used for the arm material. This material has approximately 3 times the specific rigidity compared to conventional aluminum and reduces resonance.<br><br>Equipped with a quick stop mechanism that combines an electronic brake that uses an electronic circuit to apply the force of a motor and reverse rotation, and a mechanical brake that uses a plunger to stop the rotation of the rotor.<br><br>The motor and tone arm are fixed to a 12 kg weight base made of laminated aluminum and barium sulfate of high density material.<br>In addition, the base is completely floated from the cabinet to prevent sound pressure from the speakers and vibration from the floor. adopting a coaxial suspension system.<br><br>In order to enable a high howling margin, a triple structure insulator has been adopted.<br>The 25 kg body is supported by an oil dump type piston structure using a 62 mm spring, and special rubber is used to absorb surging of the spring.<br>In addition, since the natural frequency of the insulator is set to 5 Hz or less, which is lower than the natural frequency of the tone arm, a high howling margin is obtained by combining with the vibration isolation structure of the coaxial suspension.<br><br>The cabinet is designed with a combination of a Brazilian Rosewood natural wood finish cabinet and a tempered glass dust cover to prevent howling.<br><br>A very thick power cord made of highly conductive oxygen-free copper is used for the power cord, reducing losses in wire rod and greatly improving non-linear strain.<br>In addition, by clearly displaying the polarity, the sound quality is improved.</p>
