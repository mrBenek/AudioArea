				<p class="detail">The cassette deck was developed not as a low-cost 3-head model but as a top-of-the-line 2-head model.<br><br>The head uses RP-2G, which is a SENDUST recording / reproducing head.<br>This head is manufactured using Nakamichi&#39;s unique precision processing technology cultivated in the development of the CrystalHead. It is reduced to the processed 歪大 by a processing method that does not give any stress to the core material and a special treatment that prevents distortion in each process. This realizes a read / write head that is as close as possible to the theoretical characteristics. As a result, an ordinary head with a gap width of 1.2 microns has acquired excellent characteristics of 20 Hz to 20 kHz.<br><br>The mechanism part uses Nakamichi&#39;s unique silent mechanism.<br>This system uses a dedicated motor controlled by a microprocessor to smoothly move the head base up and down to prevent damage to the tape and head.<br>In addition, a newly developed load-sensitive reel driver is used for the reel motor. By detecting the load applied to the left and right reel shafts, the driving force is always maintained at the optimum level. This prevents damage to the tape and reduces the flutter content of the sound.<br><br>A reference DC amplifier is used for the amplifier section.<br>By adopting a 2-head system, we have been able to pursue quality within a limited cost, and have achieved excellent characteristics with a dynamic range of + 20 dB or more and a single unit distortion rate of 0.005% or less.<br>In addition, a dual mono configuration is adopted for the board layout.<br><br>High-precision one way transport has been adopted.<br><br>Multi-regulated power supply is adopted for the power supply part to eliminate mutual interference.<br><br>Acoustic insulator is used to reduce the influence of external vibration.<br><br>Equipped with Dolby B/C Type NR as a noise reduction system.<br><br>Equipped with an independent equalizer switch.<br><br>Equipped with an output volume.<br><br>System remote terminal and headphone terminal are installed.<br><br>There are approximately 30 adjustment mechanisms inside, and by carefully adjusting all items in the manufacturing process, each individual error is pushed to the limit and excellent characteristics are acquired.<br>For example, a typical cassette deck has only one semi-fixed volume for bias adjustment for each L and R, so only one of the three tape positions can be adjusted accurately. On the other hand, the CR series has a total of six semi-fixed volumes for L and R. By pursuing the characteristics of all positions to the limit, excellent sound quality is obtained even in normal position.<br>In addition, 56 items of actual measurement of characteristics were carried out on a perfectly adjusted deck, and every item was strictly measured one by one, and only the individual which sufficiently satisfied the specification is shipped.</p>
