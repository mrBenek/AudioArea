				<p class="detail">A top-of-the-line CD/SACD player with Advanced AL24 Processing.<br><br>Newly developed Advanced AL24 Processing is installed in the reproduction system of PCM signal (CD / digital).<br>In addition to the AL24 Processing Plus, which is a conventional bit extension technology, this circuit greatly improves the amount of information in the time domain by our own high-speed signal detection and processing technology. In addition to data expansion from 16-bit original information to 24-bit data, this circuit performs more fine-grained natural correction processing without losing original data by interpolation of data on the time axis and up-convert sampling using an algorithm developed by our own using large-capacity arithmetic processing devices such as DSP and FPGA.<br>In addition, the digital filter is more adaptable, and it performs optimum filtering operation processing for pulse-response without ringing as well as for pulsatile tone data and attack sound. By this, spatial information such as the subtle nuances of music, the position of the performer, and the width, height and depth of the performance hall (stage) are reproduced more naturally.<br><br>The mechanism uses an original drive mechanism, and all the controls (signal processing, drive circuit and firmware) are developed in-house to ensure high reliability.<br>The DCD-SA1 uses a long-life brushless motor to cope with SACD playback when the disc rotates at high speed. The motor shaft length is extremely short to suppress vibration, thereby ensuring performance that can withstand high rotation.<br>In addition, in order to absorb all variations, such as the misalignment of the optical axis when the laser beam is irradiated onto the disk, the mechanical flatness of the pickup mechanical base, and the mechanical tilt of the brushless motor shaft, all skew adjustments (tilt correction) are carried out to optimum signal reproduction and playability.<br>The S. V. H. Loader, a hybrid anti-vibration structure using anti-vibration paint and metal plates, has been adopted for the loader mechanism, and a stable disk drive has been realized by the optimum design of the mechanism base floating.<br><br>The master clock uses an oscillator with an oscillation accuracy of ± 1 ppm or less (at room temperature), which is more accurate than conventional models.<br>By modularizing the circuit block, the influence of load capacity such as the substrate pattern is suppressed, and the oscillation output is extremely stable compared with a general crystal oscillator.<br>In addition, high-precision design is carried out by investing know-how such as the routing of the pattern wiring on the clock substrate and the supply method to each IC. In particular, the physical distance between the clock and the DAC is shortened, and clock design that cannot be obtained only by internal oscillation centered on the DAC is carried out, which suppresses the effect of jitter noise.<br>In addition, the DAC is used as a master and the PCM and DSD decoder LSIs are used as slaves to generate highly accurate clocks and perform D/A conversion.<br><br>The D/A converter has a 4-DAC configuration. A two channel device is used for one channel to form a differential output circuit. The HOT and COLD circuits are independent of the D/A converter to form a fully differential balance circuit.<br>Unlike the method in which the phase is inverted by the operational amplifier after the output of the D/A converter, there is no delay between HOT and COLD, making the circuit configuration ideal for distortion and sound quality.<br>A differential drive circuit configuration is also used for the unbalanced output circuit.<br><br>A triple floating structure has been adopted from the transformer base to the power transformer in order to thoroughly prevent vibration of the power transformer.<br>First of all, four kinds of cushioning materials with different resonance frequencies are combined in the chassis mounting part of the transformer base of aluminum sand mold casting to suppress vibration transmission in a wide frequency band. Then, the fixing screw is floated between the transformer base and the transformer case with a fluorine resin washer and cushioning material. Furthermore, the power transformer itself is floated inside the case with a special filler material. In particular, the filling of this transformer is carried out in two stages over a long period of time so that the transformer itself does not touch the case.<br>In addition, high-grade core material and OFC winding are adopted for the transformer body, and S/N and energy sense are improved by arranging the flux of the transformer for digital and audio to cancel each other.<br><br>In order to suppress the influence of external vibration and internal fine vibration on sound quality, we have adopted a four layer bottom plate structure, cast iron insulator, hybrid structure panel, and vibration-proof design of the substrate.<br>High rigidity is achieved by placing four flat chassis on the bottom plate of the chassis to confine resonance components in the plane direction of the chassis.<br>The cast iron iron insulator, Denon has specified its own carbon content determined by sound quality tuning. In addition, special cushioning materials and natural fibers are sandwiched between the bottom plate to limit the effect of floor vibration over a wide range of frequencies.<br>In addition, vibration analysis is carried out for each of the side, top and rear panels constituting the housing, and different types of members are combined to suppress the resonance frequency of each part. In particular, the top panel has a double-split structure to make the vibration mode more complicated, making it difficult to resonate even by itself.<br>As an anti-vibration measure for the PCB, the transmission of minute vibrations is suppressed by floating the PCB with fluorine-based resin between the chassis and PCB.<br><br>Equipped with a digital input terminal, it can also be used as a D/A converter.<br>The digital input signal can be sampled at a frequency of up to 192 kHz and can be used as a high-quality D/A converter with the Advanced AL24 Processing.<br><br>Pure Direct mode is installed.<br>In this mode, the display and digital signal output are turned off. By turning off the high-pulse signal of the display driver circuit, adverse effects on the audio circuit are suppressed.<br>Wireless remote control is included.<br>There were two variations of the DCD-SA1 remote control depending on when it was sold. The RC-992 was listed in the 2004 catalog that was released and the RC-997 was replaced in the February 2005 catalog.</p>
