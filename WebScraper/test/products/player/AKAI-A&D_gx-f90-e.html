				<p class="detail">A 3-head stereo cassette deck equipped with a Super GX head.<br><br>Super GX head has been adopted for the head.<br>Using newly developed High and High μ ferrite materials, the recording gap (4 μ) and the reproducing gap (1 μ) are made independent of each other, making it a REC/PB combination type head capable of simultaneous monitoring.<br>Compared with metal heads such as Sendust, it has not only superior sound quality characteristics such as frequency characteristics, distortion factor, and dynamic range, but also superior secondary characteristics such as abrasion resistance, low noise, and dust resistance.<br><br>The drive train uses a highly reliable D. D. Capstan 2-motor system to achieve stable rotational performance and long-lasting excellent initial characteristics.<br>In particular, the D. D. motor for the capstan drive is equipped with Akai&#39;s original brushless FG servo DC motor, which realizes high performances in all respects such as stability, quietness, rotational accuracy, and torque. By using a three phase full-wave drive system that detects the position of Hall elements and a fast-response FG servo circuit, excellent rotational accuracy with large torque and less wow and flutter components is obtained. Moreover, since it is brushless, there is no abrasion of the brush or adhesion of carbon, and the S / N ratio is greatly improved.<br><br>Equipped with an IPLS (Instant Program Locating System), in which the playback head detects the boundary between the signal part recorded on the tape and the non-signal part and automatically enters the play state.<br>The GX-F90 uses a memory switch, a repeat switch, and an IPLS switch to enable a variety of tape plays. You can enjoy a memory play with a tape counter 000 to start a tape, a repeat play that automatically repeats playback / rewind / playback on one side of a tape, and a memory repeat play that combines a memory function and a repeat function.<br>If the repeat switch and the IPLS switch are operated simultaneously, the same program can be played continuously.<br><br>Utilizing the mechanism of the 2-motor system, the operation buttons adopt a feather-touch type direct function change mechanism in which the timing of each operation is controlled by an IC logic circuit.<br><br>Equipped with a high-precision 24-segment digital bar meter that can be switched to either a VU meter or peak meter with a single switch.<br><br>It is equipped with a recording cancellation mechanism that can quickly cancel the part recorded by mistake during air check.<br>When this switch is pressed, the tape is rewound to the part of the head position recorded by mistake, and the tape automatically enters the recording standby (pause) state.<br><br>AKAI&#39;s unique ADR system automatically adjusts the recording equalizer according to the frequency band and level of the input signal to prevent distortion due to demagnetization in the high frequency range.<br><br>Equipped with a 4-position tape selector and a combination of bias equalizers suitable for each type of tape, you can bring out the performance of the tape with one touch operation.<br>When the tape selector is operated, the tape position indicator is set to LN, LH and CrO.<sub>2</sub>And METAL.<br><br>Equipped with Dolby NR system which effectively improves the hissing unique to tape.<br>Since the GX-F90 is a double-process Dolby NR with independent circuits for recording and playback, it is possible to monitor the Dolby effect while recording.<br>In addition, it is equipped with a recording calibration mechanism with a built-in 400 hz oscillator that can adjust the recording / playback level depending on the tape used, so you can take full advantage of the Dolby effect.<br><br>An MPX filter switch is installed to prevent the Dolby NR from malfunctioning with a 19 kHz pilot signal when recording an FM stereo broadcast transmission.<br><br>It is equipped with a recording mute mechanism convenient for air check and dubbing, an independent input level control for two microphone / line systems, a timer start mechanism for voice recording / alarm playback, an output volume for headphone volume control, and a mono microphone mechanism for monaural recording with one microphone.<br><br>Equipped with a remote control terminal to which a separately sold remote control unit can be connected.</p>
