				<p class="detail">Twin recording and quick reverse deck equipped with auto editor function.<br><br>It is equipped with an auto editor function which is a further development of the multi editor function adopted in the DD-VR77.<br>This feature allows you to automatically erase an unwanted part of a recorded tape by specifying a distance between two points : after fade-out → fade-in, cutout → cut-in, or a combination of fade and cut.<br>When the electronic counter is in editor mode, the program buttons 0, 1, 5 0, 1, 5, and 6 function as a fade-out button, fade-in button, cutout button, and cut-in button, respectively. While playing the tape, when an unnecessary part comes in, stop and press the fade-out (or cutout) button. when the necessary part comes in, stop and press the fade-in (or cut-in) button. When the start button is pressed, the tape is automatically rewound to the point where the fade-out button was pressed, and the unnecessary part is erased.<br>Fade-out and fade-in times are approximately 5 seconds (Deck I) with metal tape.<br><br>Tape A/B side It is equipped with a random access program music selection mechanism that can play up to 15 songs each and 30 songs in total.<br>This mechanism is equipped with an alternate designation function. It can be designated from A-plane to B-plane or from B-plane to A-plane. Each time the A/B plane is switched during playback, it does not return to the beginning of the tape. Once the track is in place, it is completely memorized and goes straight to that track in the order in which it was programmed.<br><br>Dubbing from Deck I to Deck II can be done with one touch for both constant speed and double speed.<br>You can also copy a random program by pressing the dubbing button after selecting a random program (Deck II).<br><br>It has adopted twin quick reverse mechanism, and it is possible to record continuously for 3 hours (C-90x2 pieces), alternate continuous recording for Deck I / Deck II, simultaneous recording for Deck I / Deck II.<br><br>The reverse mechanism adopts a fine-axis reverse system, and it is equipped with accurate azimuth adjustment for outward and return paths, reliable reverse operation by microcomputer, and durability to maintain initial performance for a long period.<br><br>The amplifier circuit uses a DC amplifier configuration.<br><br>Equipped with a Dolby B/C NR system as a noise reduction system.<br><br>It is equipped with a newly developed electronic counter that can switch between 3 modes with one touch operation.<br>In the counter mode, the display can be changed by operating the Deck I / Deck II changeover switch. The deck that is not displayed is also counted by the internal counter.<br>In program mode, various information about the random access program is displayed. In addition, program index scanning is also possible by using the shift button together.<br>In Editor mode, you can check the operation status of Auto Editor.<br><br>Equipped with computer shift control function to change mechanical operation by shift button.<br><br>You can auto-fade by pressing the Rec Mute button while pressing the Shift button. The fade-in / out time is approximately 5 seconds.<br><br>When the shift button and FF button are pressed simultaneously, it becomes an index scan, and the head of the song can be played for about 10 seconds one after another. You can also set the playback time as desired if it is 9 seconds or less.<br><br>If you press the Play button while holding down the Shift button, blank skipping occurs. If there is a blank for more than approximately 10 seconds during playback, the FF scan is used to fast-forward.<br><br>If you press REW while holding down the Shift button, rewinding autoplay is performed, and playback starts from the beginning of the first song after rewinding.<br><br>Pressing the Shift button and the Pause button simultaneously results in a blank search. If a 14-second blank is found in the FF state, the program returns to the end of the previous song, plays the 4-second blank, and stops.</p>
