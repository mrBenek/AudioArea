				<p class="detail">A CD player that brings together the technology and know-how of CD developers to realize a high degree of perfection.<br><br>The D/A conversion circuit consists of an original LSI (TDA-1541A S-1) which was originally developed and improved by Philips Marantz.<br>This TDA 1541 A S-1 is a selective type that is even more selected from Philips&#39; latest Device A version and has a crown mark engraved along with the model number.<br>This guarantees 0.5 LSB in the case of a small signal and 1 LSB in the case of a normal signal over the whole temperature range.<br><br>The D/A conversion configuration consists of two D/A converters per channel and a push-pull D/A conversion A conversion method is adopted.<br>The two converters are a combination of positive and negative phases, through which the waveform is synthesized, and at the same time the in-phase component is canceled and the even-order low distortion, including hum and very low-frequency noise, is cancelled out and greatly reduced.<br><br>In order to maximize the performance of the single CD, the 12 cm CD and 8 cm CD are detected by the sensor, the range of servo operation is switched by the circuit constant, and the operating point is set to be the midpoint.<br><br>The drive mechanism uses the CDM-1 type developed by Philips Marantz.<br>It is a single-beam swing-arm pickup developed from an idea different from the conventional linear tracking system. The lens is made of Rodenstock glass. It has less aberration, excellent temperature characteristics, and improved pickup capability.<br>In addition, a samarium-cobalt magnet is used for the linear motor that is the power source, and together with the servo system that controls the swing arm, a smooth and reliable bit and race is realized.<br>In addition, a die-cast base has been adopted to improve rigidity, and the influence of external vibration, etc. is suppressed.<br><br>The power supply consists of a large transformer comparable to a power amplifier and an electrolytic capacitor of 68,000 μ Fx2. In particular, new materials are used for the electrolytic capacitor, which is carefully selected to emphasize sound quality.<br>The secondary winding of the power transformer is divided into a digital circuit, an audio circuit and a display circuit to make them independent.<br>The regulator circuit also uses a discrete configuration to eliminate noise associated with the power supply.<br><br>The chassis is made of die-cast material and has a solid sandwich structure consisting of die-cast side panels and 3-mm-thick bottom plates to reduce vibration.<br>In addition, Marantz&#39;s unique ARC (Aluminum Faft Ceiling) structure is adopted for the top cover, and by using a 3-piece structure with raft cut, strength is improved and vibration mode diffusion is attempted.<br>In addition, the pre-amplifier for the laser signal, which is normally mounted in the mechanism, is isolated from the rotating system to reduce the effect of vibration.<br><br>The digital circuit, audio circuit, servo circuit, microcomputer and display circuit are designed to be independent on the circuit layout in order to prevent vibration and harmful interference.<br><br>Equipped with two digital outputs, optical and coaxial.<br><br>In addition to the normal random access program (20 songs), it is equipped with a filing bank &quot;FTS&quot;. Once the program is stored in memory, it can be filed semi-permanently even when the power is turned off.<br><br>Equipped with remote control as standard.</p>
