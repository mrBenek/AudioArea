				<p class="detail">This MD deck was developed using the high-quality sound technology of the ES series.<br><br>In order to make maximum use of the ATRAC audio compression technology format and further improve sound quality, we have introduced a 20-bit technology (Wide Bit Stream) that performs block floating processing, a new computation process, using a newly developed 20-bit input / output digital processing LSI for ATRAC as a key device.<br>In this process, we focus on dividing the data into three bands (low, medium, and high) and calculating it. We leave the block with large data as it is and calculate the block with small data by raising the level of each block. This makes it possible to reproduce low-order bits that had been truncated in the past, and greatly improves the reproducibility of fine-level music signals.<br>We have also revised the bit allocation algorithm, which determines the bit allocation during compression, to improve the reproducibility of residuals and reduce distortion.<br><br>Newly developed A/D and D/A converters have been adopted in order to meet the needs for higher sound quality with 20-bit technology.<br>The D/A converter employs a newly developed D/A converter that combines a full feed-forward digital filter and a 1-bit pulse generator developed for the New ES series CD players.<br>The A/D converter employs a newly developed 18-bit Σ Δ (sigma-delta) A/D converter with high-precision oversampling.<br><br>Equipped with a sampling rate converter that automatically converts 32 kHz or 48 kHz sampling frequency to 44.1 kHz.<br>In addition, the MDS-JA3ES uses the latest device with 20-bit accuracy in both time axis and level to improve conversion accuracy.<br><br>The power transformer uses an R-core transformer with excellent magnetic characteristics.<br>In addition, the newly developed thin mechanical deck and a low center of gravity center mechanical mount system with a power supply block placed in the center of the chassis provide a highly stable structure that is resistant to vibration.<br>In addition, we have introduced technologies common to the New ES Series, such as the FB chassis with improved vibration resistance by firmly joining the entire chassis and the eccentric insulator that reduces vibration transmission from the outside.<br><br>It is equipped with a time machine recording function, and if you press the multi-jog dial in the recording pause state, it is possible to record the sound up to 6 seconds before to the disk.<br><br>You can automatically find and record unrecorded parts, record from the beginning of the song you want to delete, or record from the middle of any song you want to delete.<br><br>It is equipped with a TOC EDIT function and a title &amp; date function that can record a title of approximately 1,700 characters and the date and time of recording.<br>In addition, simple operation is realized by the built-in jog dial.<br><br>Equipped with two digital input terminals that are coaxial with the optical system.<br>Also, an optical digital output terminal is mounted.<br><br>Equipped with an independent L/R stereo microphone input terminal.<br><br>It is equipped with a smart space function that automatically adjusts the interval between songs to approximately 3 seconds during digital recording.<br><br>Equipped with track marking function.<br><br>Equipped with a 22-segment digital peak meter.<br><br>Equipped with disk in and auto power function.<br><br>It comes with a wireless remote controller that can record CD sync by combining with Sony&#39;s CD player.<br><br>Mono format discs are play-only.<br><br>It is equipped with a 4-megabit DRAM that can store music signals for up to about 8 seconds to prevent skipping sound.<br>In addition, taking advantage of memory storage, Memory Start playback, in which the sound starts immediately after the pause is released, is made possible.<br><br>Serial Copy Management System (SCMS) allows only one generation of digital recording and no more than two generations of digital recording.<br><br>There are 2 variations, gold and black.</p>
