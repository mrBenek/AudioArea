				<p class="detail">A CD player that embodies the concept of pure transmission by introducing advanced technologies.<br><br>A disk stabilizer is used to reduce unnecessary vibration of the disk.<br><br>The pickup uses aspherical objective lenses and compound lenses to reduce transmission loss of laser power.<br>In addition, the drive unit adopts a focus parallel drive mechanism and cross parallel suspension system to obtain accurate and highly sensitive focus and trace performance.<br>By holding these optical mechanisms in the precision die-cast body, it is resistant to disturbance.<br><br>A linear servo system is used to prevent sound skipping caused by scratches or dirt on the disc.<br>Taking advantage of the advantages of the 3-beam tracking system, we control the servo amount appropriately so that the leading beam detects scratches and dirt that are different from those of the pit train at the front, and the pickup does not follow the scratches and cause track jump.<br><br>It employs a method that synchronizes digital signal processing by multiple LSIs with one master clock.<br>This prevents jitter components from being included in digital signals and beats from occurring between signals, minimizing the influence on servo circuits and audio circuits.<br><br>The audio circuit employs a digital filter, eliminating the need to use a low-pass filter with steep characteristics. As a result, low-distortion characteristics with little phase rotation are obtained up to the high frequency band of 20 kHz.<br><br>We have adopted a pure transmission system to achieve higher purity transmission.<br>The digital circuit is clearly separated from the analog circuit, and the digital part reduces unnecessary vibration of the disk due to the disk stabilizer and eliminates the adverse effect of external noise on the digital signal.<br>In the audio section, a low-noise low-output impedance regulator is placed close to the audio circuit on the PCB to supply each block circuit with reduced impedance rise.<br>In addition, the use of IC common to L and R is eliminated, and L and R symmetrical straight pattern is adopted.<br><br>In order to produce stable sound, an insulator with high rigidity and high vibration damping rate is adopted.<br>In addition, the optical mechanism, which avoids vibration, is made into a floating structure, and audio insulation is adopted to reduce external vibration.<br><br>The power supply for servo, digital and audio systems is a twin power transformer that is completely separated from the transformer itself.<br>This reduces the influence of the servo and digital circuits on the audio circuit.<br>In addition, high-purity OFC windings are used in the Orient Core material for power transformers for audio circuits, and OFC wires are used for the drawers.<br><br>We use carefully selected parts for high-purity transmission.<br>Glass case electrolytic capacitor, OFC power cord, fast recovery diode, copper-foil styrene capacitor, FOC connection code (gold-plated plug), brass cap carbon resistor, etc. are used. In addition, OFC lead wire and OFC bus bar are used for audio circuit.<br>In particular, all resistors used for audio circuits are within a tolerance of 1%. In combination with carefully selected operational amplifiers, all adjustable semi-fixed volumes are eliminated.<br><br>Equipped with functions such as pause program function, program adjustment time display, track display, 10-key program function, repeat all songs / program / one song, index search, 3-speed manual search, etc.<br><br>It uses a headphone port with volume.<br><br>Subcode output terminal is mounted.</p>
