				<p class="detail">Stereo cassette deck equipped with quartz lock pulse servo DD motor and Dolby C NR.<br><br>A pulse servo DD motor is used for the mechanism.<br>The basic shape of this motor is a 4-phase, 8-pole, flat-facing brushless, slotless, coreless, FG servo direct drive. The Hall element developed by Victor Central R &amp; D Laboratories performs polarity switching to realize a brushless motor. There is no mechanical contact that causes noise and sparks. Furthermore, by removing the core and removing the slot, unevenness and noise such as cocking can be eliminated, making it possible to achieve a smaller size and higher performance.<br>The pulse servo DD motor uses an FG servo in the servo circuit. The rotation speed is detected by a frequency generator. Detection error due to positional deviation is prevented by using an all-round integration type of 204 poles and 102 pulses. In addition, to prevent positional deviation from the beginning, the FG magnet is coaxial with the capstan and is magnetized after the center of the substrate is held.<br>In addition, in order to prevent uneven torque due to temperature rise, an auto balance circuit with double differential control circuit is mounted to keep the driving force constant.<br><br>The DD-10 uses a quartz lock for the pulse servo DD motor, and the number of revolutions controlled by pulse servo is maintained at constant speed by quartz control.<br><br>The flywheels are made of a compound material that is effective against modulation noise, eliminating flutter components and high frequency cloudiness caused by vibration.<br><br>The amplifier circuit employs a DC configuration amplifier. By reducing the number of signal capacitors, distortion, noise and phase change are reduced, and transient characteristics are also improved. In particular, the head amplifier is a direct coupling using a double differential amplifier, and the microphone amplifier and recording amplifier are also DC configuration amplifiers with ± 2 power supplies. The amplifier through which audio signals pass is made as DC configuration as possible.<br><br>It uses a combination head that uses an X cutSA head for the playback head and an SA head for the recording head. A 3-head system that uses both recording and playback heads can provide the optimal gap width for each head, enabling higher-fidelity recording and playback.<br>The SA head has a unique composite structure consisting of a Permalloy 6-layer laminate core and a Sen-alloy chip bonded at high temperature to the tape sliding surface. It has many advantages such as core loss, gap accuracy, wear resistance, and corrosion resistance. It also supports the superior high-frequency characteristics of metal tape due to its high maximum magnetic flux density.<br>In addition, the X-cutSA head improves the low-range waviness (contour effect) corresponding to the high-range stretch.<br><br>An SA head is used for the erasing head.<br><br>Full logic control is adopted.<br><br>Equipped with B ・ E ・ Stuning system using microcomputer, recording bias, recording equalizer and recording sensitivity are automatically set for each tape, making it possible to perform just tuning for each tape.<br>In addition, the direction of the 3-head B, E, and S was examined when it was mounted on the DD-9 model, and it was redesigned to improve the accuracy while keeping the tuning time as it is, so that more balanced recording is possible.<br><br>As a noise reduction system, in addition to ANRS (Dolby B NR), Dolby C NR is equipped.<br>In this circuit, the signal is compressed and expanded in a two stage sliding band. The sliding band is a method of changing the compression and expansion frequency according to the signal level. It is effective in reducing bleeding noise. In addition, the noise reduction band is wider than in the past in the middle and high frequency range, and excellent noise reduction effect and linearity improvement effect in the high frequency range are obtained.<br><br>Equipped with a 2-color FL digital level meter that can switch between peak and VU.<br>This meter uses 18-segment and 1-segment 20-dot fluorescent display panels on the left and right sides respectively. In particular, more than 0 VU is colored in red, making it easy to see.<br>In addition, the peak display is also set to rise and fall times that are easy to see by applying moderate braking, and the peak is held automatically for up to 2 seconds.<br><br>Electronic volume is used for the input volume.<br><br>Equipped with a 4-digit electronic counter.<br><br>Equipped with a stopwatch function.<br><br>It is equipped with a timer standby mechanism equipped with a timer safety lock for preventing erroneous erasure. By connecting an optional timer, it is possible to record absence and play an alarm clock.<br><br>Equipped with memory auto-rewind mechanism.<br><br>It has a headphone linked playback volume.<br><br>Equipped with remote control terminal.</p>
