				<p class="detail">An 8-track 38 cm multi-recorder with 1/2-inch tape that is as large as a home deck and has performance and functions comparable to those of commercial multi-recorders.<br><br>In addition to normal sync recording, ping-pong recording between tracks is also possible.<br>The newly developed bias control circuit also enables punch-in and punch-out with minimal click noise.<br><br>The 80-8 has an 8-track, 8-channel configuration, and can use 1/2-inch wide tapes.<br>In addition, a newly developed sync head has been adopted to achieve performance comparable to conventional 8-channel recorders using 1-inch tapes.<br><br>In order to improve performance, it uses a 38 cm single-speed configuration in which other speeds are omitted. In addition to equalization of recording and playback, the head gap length, impedance roller, scrape filter, etc. are specifically designed to match the 38 cm speed.<br><br>The head consists of three heads : erase, sync, and monitor. Unlike the general three head type, the sync head has a recording function and a full playback function. The 80-8 uses a Shinkai head with excellent frequency characteristics and channel separation to match the recording wavelengths, especially at 38 cm speed. The head shield plate on the front blocks out external induction noise.<br>80-8 also allows multi-recording, in which the sound played in sync mode is mixed with other and recorded on a separate track.<br><br>Equipped with an output selector.<br>The input position is used to adjust the recording level. In this case, the input signal is output to the meter and output terminal.<br>In the Norm position, the sync head is played back and the input signal or sync playback signal is output in conjunction with the eight function selectors on the left.<br>In the Monitor position, the monitor head operates and the signal recorded on the tape can be monitored simultaneously during recording.<br><br>The Function Selector functions as both a recording mode switch and a monitor switch.<br>When the output selector is in the Norm position and the function selector is OFF, the sync regenerating condition (recording mode is OFF in this case) occurs. When the function selector is ON, the LED immediately above the button flashes and the recording mode is ON (recording standby), and the input signal is monitored.<br>This mechanism has a structure that demonstrates its power by punch-in (follow-up recording). First, the drive control is set to recording standby and the tape is played back. During playback, when the desired recording position is reached, press the function selector to start recording and the monitor is switched to the input side. In other words, the recording mode and monitor can be switched simultaneously with one operation, improving operability.<br>A bias control circuit is built-in to prevent recording clicks caused by turning the function selector ON / OFF.<br><br>An overload indicator using LED is mounted on the top of the VU meter to confirm excessive input.<br>The LED lighting level is set to + 6 VU but can be changed by the semi-fixed volume of the printed circuit board.<br><br>All drive control is performed by IC logic circuit and motion sensor to improve operability. This enables quick and smooth transition from quick winding to play movement, and no stretch or slack of the tape occurs no matter how the control button is operated.<br>In addition, all driving operations can be operated by the Remote Control Unit RC-170 which is an accessory sold separately.<br><br>The meter section opens when the two screws on the front panel are removed, making maintenance and calibration easy.<br>The amplifier boards are integrated into one printed circuit board for each channel for each channel to improve maintainability.<br><br>The head housing also adopts an opening / closing structure to improve maintainability.<br><br>It has a queue mechanism.<br><br>Equipped with a memory auto-stop mechanism, it can automatically stop at the preset counter position when rewinding.<br><br>Uses a reel clamper that allows one touch attachment of the reel.<br><br>The optional dedicated dbx noise reduction module DX-8 provides an excellent dynamic range of more than 100 dB.</p>
