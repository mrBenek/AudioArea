				<p class="detail">Stereo cassette deck equipped with A. R. H. S. reverse mechanism.<br><br>ACULINE ローティティング Head System (A. R. H. S.) has been developed and adopted for the head part. It is a complete version of the rotary head system.<br>In the A. R. H. S., high precision aluminum die-cast with light weight and high shock absorption capacity is processed to micron order for the head holder and bearing of the rotating part. In addition, by using two shield type precision micro bearings for the bearing of the rotating part for the first time in the world, excellent rotational accuracy of bearing inner diameter tolerance of 0 -8 μ and head holder shaft outer diameter tolerance of -8 -13 μ is realized, and degradation of initial characteristics due to shock, dust, temperature change, etc. is suppressed.<br>The stopper of the rotary head has a Vickers hardness of 1,800 Hv and a load capacity of 24,000kg/cm.<sup>2</sup>It uses alumina ceramics with purity of 99.5% which is proud of it. By combining it with a high-precision stainless steel azimuth screw with a superfine pitch, it realizes fine azimuth adjustment independent in both directions. In addition, it is combined with Teac&#39;s unique head elevation triple gear that enables the height adjustment of the head, and it maintains the head position in three dimensions.<br><br>Equipped with E ・ M (Electro Magnetic) hysteresis and tension servo.<br>This system is the first in the world to use an electromagnetic hysteresis coupling for back-tension control. This is an electromagnetic non-contact brake that is essentially different from the friction brakes that are commonly used. It has little torque fluctuation and does not vary with temperature or humidity. In addition, the I. R. (infrared ray) photo-reflector detects the rotation speed of the reel and changes the current in the coil, so a constant tape tension is always obtained. In addition, a newly developed Fe-Mn type hard magnetic material is used for the magnetic material to obtain effective brake torque and to realize a constant tape tension.<br>Tape tension is further stabilized by the adoption of a twin capstan system that is symmetrical and dedicated to forward and reverse.<br><br>By adopting a 3-motor system in which dedicated motors are used for the capstan drive, reel drive and mechanism, respectively, 3S (Soft, Smooth and Silent) is achieved.<br><br>In the power supply section, the power source for the amplifier system and the power source for the mechanism system are completely separated, and the winding of the transformer is also completely separated to prevent sound quality degradation due to mutual noise interference.<br>In addition, by adopting ± 2 power supply system, earth potential becomes clear, system noise is reduced, and SN ratio, transient response characteristics, and distortion factor are improved.<br><br>The amplifier section has an all-DC configuration. The head and amplifier are directly connected to each other without a condenser. This makes it possible to reproduce very low frequencies and to improve the distortion factor of the low frequency components.<br><br>Most of the amplifier systems from signal input to output are integrated on a single board, and the display and switches are connected directly to the board to prevent noise and reduce the length of wires.<br>In addition, LC-OFC is used for signal lead wires to improve transmission characteristics signal lead wires. In addition, there is no variation in parts, and 3S (Simple, Straight, and Small) is achieved by using aluminum electrolytic capacitors and film capacitors exclusively for audio with digital compatibility and high-sound quality design. This reduces signal turbidity and degradation.<br><br>It is equipped with dbx and Dolby B/C NR as noise reduction system.<br>The dbx NR uses a high-density LSI to compress the dynamic range of the input signal to 1/2 in decibels for recording. By accurately doubling the dynamic range during playback, the tape hissing is reduced by 30 to 40 dB, and the dynamic range exceeding the cassette limit of 110 dB is obtained.<br>The Dolby B/C NR uses a highly reliable one chip LSI.<br><br>Equipped with Dolby HX Pro.<br>This circuit has a function to prevent the high-frequency signal applied to the recording head from operating as a bias when recording the deck. It detects the component of 10 kHz or higher in the signal and automatically controls to reduce the bias when the component is large, thereby improving the high-frequency reduction in high-level recording.<br>Also, since the Dolby HX Pro is a circuit that operates only when recording, playback is possible even on models without the Dolby HX Pro.<br><br>A BIAS &amp; LEVEL manual calibration mechanism is installed to optimize recording conditions that vary slightly depending on the type of tape.<br>The BIAS transmitter contains a master oscillator and a BIAS amplifier, which are also used in professional MTRs. The LEVEL can be controlled by ± 3 dB and the BIAS by ± 20%.<br><br>To achieve high-precision and speedy control, two dedicated microcomputers are installed.<br>First, the LSI for system control judges various input states, determines the operation mode, and transmits it to the mechanism control, and controls counter display, memory operation, and CPS.<br>The mechanism control LSI controls the CAM motor to the specified position, controls the Reel motor, controls the amplifier control output, and displays the operation mode.<br><br>In addition to the L/R, a master volume that can be easily fine-tuned is installed to enable accurate volume adjustment.<br><br>It uses an auto monitor mechanism that automates the switching between tape monitor and source monitor.<br><br>Equipped with an auto tape selector that automatically detects Normal/CrO2/Metal.<br><br>It is equipped with a CPS system that searches and plays any songs from the current song up to 15 songs in front and back.<br><br>It is equipped with a CDS system that searches for and plays back any songs from the beginning of the cassette.<br><br>Equipped with a block repeat mechanism that repeats playback between two points.<br><br>Equipped with 4-mode (tape counter / tape run timer / CPS count / CDS count) switching multi-electronic counter.<br><br>Equipped with FL multi-function display with microprocessor control.<br><br>Equipped with an MPX filter switch.<br><br>Uses gold-plated input / output terminals.<br><br>Equipped with an auto-rec mute mechanism for approximately 4 seconds.<br><br>Wireless remote controller with 16 function keys is included.<br><br>There was a side wood sold separately.</p>
