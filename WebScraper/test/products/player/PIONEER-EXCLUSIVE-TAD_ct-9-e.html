				<p class="detail">This is Pioneer&#39;s first stereo cassette deck that allows you to perform all operations from the front, such as attaching and detaching tapes and operating knobs and levers.<br>The CT-97 has rack mounts on both sides so that the CT-9 can be mounted on an EIA standard rack (JA-R1S).<br><br>It uses a full-open mechanism that allows you to directly see everything from the tape running condition to the label title.<br>The door is uniquely designed to be completely stored in the body when opened, and is equipped with a protective device that prevents the tape from entering a playback / recording state unless the tape is set correctly.<br><br>A double-link tape holding mechanism is used to fix the tape, enabling secure fixing and soft touch attachment / detachment.<br>In addition, the use of a 6-blade reel shaft eliminates the play of the reel hub, further improving the running stability of the tape.<br><br>It uses a 2-motor system that uses a dedicated 4.8cm/s constant speed motor for Play and a dedicated FF/REW motor. This eliminates the need for the constant speed drive motor to bear rotational force during FF/REW unlike the 1-motor system, and provides high performance and high reliability.<br>The motor for Play uses a high-torque electronically controlled DC motor (built-in generator) with less torque ripple and vibration.<br>The FF/REW uses a DC torque motor that achieves both high-speed hoisting and stability, enabling stable driving both during constant speed driving and FF/REW driving.<br><br>NPN3-stage direct connection head amplifier is used for equalizer amplifier and microphone amplifier.<br>Low-loss NFB is applied over a wide band, and excellent high-frequency characteristics are achieved. In addition, a large dynamic margin of 40 dB or more above the reference level is ensured.<br><br>The head uses a carefully selected ferrite solid head with less head wear and a semi-permanent life.<br>In addition, since it is a hyperbolic type using precision processing technology, the head touch is good, the audio skipping due to adhesion of dust is little, and the high-frequency compensation by the recording amplifier can be minimized to prevent the generation of high-frequency distortion due to excessive compensation.<br><br>When a chrome tape with a sensing hole is attached, regardless of the position of the tape selector button, the bias equalizer will automatically switch to the chrome circuit with priority and the chrome indicator lamp will light simultaneously.<br>When using chrome tape without detection hole, ferrichrome tape, LH tape, etc., manual switching is also possible with the tape selector button.<br>The equalizer shall be switched by an electronic switching method (STD : 1950 + 120 μ s, CrO) for both playback and recording.<sub>2</sub>: 3180 + 70 μ s) to reduce click noise that is likely to occur during switching.<br><br>Equipped with a large level meter and a logarithmic compression meter amplifier.<br>It is also equipped with a peak level indicator using a light emitting diode that responds to + 5 dB level in several mmsec.<br><br>Equipped with a Dolby system that greatly improves tape hissing without compromising the sound quality of the recording source.<br>When Dolby ON is selected, the indicator lamp lights up.<br><br>A limiter circuit is used to automatically suppress the over-level portion when an unexpected over-input occurs.<br><br>Equipped with equipped with a tape counter, and by presetting the rewind or play lever, it is possible to play a memory play in which playback starts automatically from the start point.<br><br>It is equipped with a lamp that illuminates the window of the cassette from the back, and you can clearly see the remaining amount of tape.<br>In addition, red tape end marker lines are provided on the left and right sides of the lighting section, so that you can know the end of tape winding in advance.<br><br>It is equipped with a multiplex filter release switch. By turning this switch off for monaural FM recording, you can obtain wider frequency characteristics.<br><br>Each of the microphone and line is equipped with a dedicated level control to enable mixing recording.<br><br>Uses a direct change that allows you to move to the next operation from any position without pressing the STOP button.<br>By adopting electronic control circuit, it is possible to operate with soft touch without applying excessive force to the tape.</p>
