				<p class="detail">A CD/MD deck that integrates the MD deck and CD player and can be connected to a PC.<br><br>In addition to digital recording from CD to MD, it is equipped with CD-synchronized recording functions such as CD-synchronized recording that allows you to synchronize the timing between the start of performance and recording with the touch of a button.<br><br>When you listen to a CD and press the REC IT button on the remote control, it automatically returns to the beginning of the song and starts recording to the MD. When you record only one song, the MD stops automatically and the CD continues to play from the next song.<br><br>Connection with PC is possible by using PC connection kit PCLK-PX1 (sold separately).<br>This allows you to perform basic MD/CD operations, record from CD to MD, and edit MD discs on your PC.<br><br>Kanji and hiragana characters entered into the MD from a PC can be displayed on the full dot display of the main unit.<br>You can also use alphanumeric characters, symbols and katakana characters for the title function for naming discs and songs.<br><br>In the MD deck section, we have newly developed an adaptive high-frequency control technology for the DSP for the 4.5 generation ATRAC to improve high-frequency reproducibility and natural sound spread. This technology effectively uses limited data based on human audibility. In response to input signals, if the number of quantization bits is small, the high-frequency range is limited and the number of quantization bits is increased. In response to signals containing complex frequency components that are less affected by insufficient quantization bits, the reproduction band is extended to higher frequencies to improve high-frequency reproducibility.<br>The signal processing system has been improved by the combination of this adaptive high-frequency control technology and the extension of the operation word length in the wide bit stream, and the total harmonic distortion rate has been improved by about 8 dB compared to the conventional system.<br><br>Wide bit stream technology has been introduced to enable recording and playback with a wide dynamic range of 20 bits equivalent to more than 16 bits of MD format by changing input / output to 20 bits and expanding operation word length.<br><br>A hybrid pulse D/A converter is used in the CD player.<br><br>It is equipped with a sampling rate converter that automatically converts 32 kHz and 48 kHz sampling frequency to 44.1 kHz.<br><br>Equipped with a digital REC level control, the gain can be controlled from -12dB to a maximum of + 12 dB around a gain of 0 dB.<br>It also has a built-in memory function that can store the set recording level for each input channel.<br><br>Equipped with a pitch control function, you can listen at different playback speeds from -98.5% to + 12.5%.<br><br>It is equipped with a music sync function. When you press the music sync button on the remote control and the connected device starts playing, it senses the input of a music signal and automatically starts recording.<br><br>It is equipped with a time machine recording function. If you press the multi-jog dial in the recording pause state, the sound recorded on the disc is traced back to the sound of up to 6 seconds before.<br><br>Equipped with a monaural recording and playback function that allows the disc to be used twice as long as the display.<br><br>It has a TOC EDTI function that allows you to divide, combine, and move songs. It also has an UNDO function that allows you to cancel the last edit and redo it.<br>It is also equipped with a rehearsal function so that you can make decisions while checking edit points in COMBINE or DIVIDE. You can move edit points finely by minute, second, or frame (approximately 0.01 second).<br><br>Equipped with the A-B ERASE function that allows you to easily erase between two specified points in a song.<br><br>It is equipped with a title function that can record up to 1,700 characters of disc names and song titles on the disc.<br>In addition to conventional alphabets, numbers and symbols, katakana characters can also be input, and input can be done from the main body or remote controller.<br><br>The SCMS (Serial Copy Management System) allows digital recording only for one generation and does not allow digital recording for two or more generations.<br><br>It is equipped with a smart space function that automatically adjusts the non-recording portion of digital recording to approximately 3 seconds.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
