				<p class="detail">A CD player with multi-insulation system.<br><br>Reading performance is improved by suppressing disturbance and internal vibration through a multi-insulation system.<br>The mechanism mount uses a special elastic insulator to block vibration from the disk motor generated inside the mechanism. In addition, the mechanism mount section has a double structure to increase rigidity and eliminate vibration over a wide band.<br><br>The power supply section and construction have been thoroughly reviewed, and the analog section after the digital filter has been made into a twin monaural configuration. This eliminates interference between the left and right and between the front and rear sections and improves performance.<br><br>The digital filter is a 2 x oversampling digital filter with excellent inband rejection and inband ripple characteristics. This makes it possible to use an analog filter with moderate characteristics, providing excellent sound quality and performance.<br><br>A 16-bit linear D/A converter is used for the D/A converter.<br><br>In the power supply section, we have further developed a power supply system using a large-capacity multi-power supply. In addition to using a D/A converter independent power supply with a dedicated winding for the D/A converter section, we have also installed large-capacity power supplies for the digital, servo, and display systems to eliminate noise pollution caused by mutual interference through the power supply.<br>In addition, the newly developed ARPS circuit clarifies and stabilizes the analog of the D/A converter itself, eliminating the interference between digital and analog systems occurring inside the IC.<br><br>A 3-beam high-precision, low-noise, high-cost pickup with a highly precise pickup section has been adopted.<br>The DP 990 d uses a self-pulse-modulated oscillation laser to reduce operating noise caused by mode-competition noise and to prevent it from being introduced into the audio circuit. The optical system uses an objective lens with a wave aberration of λ / 40 (λ ≒ 0.78 μ m) to improve precision and efficiency, making it possible to read signals with high S/N ratio.<br>This pickup is compensated by a servo mechanism to provide excellent tracing capability. In addition, high rigidity is achieved by integrating the laser drive circuit with the pickup. In particular, the signal reader is floated by an insulator to shut out vibration from outside and inside, reducing the load on the servo circuit.<br><br>Optimal Servo Control Type III is used for the servo circuit.<br>In this circuit, a preset error voltage is applied to the servo system so that when there is a scratch on the disk, no extra force is applied to the pickup and the disk passes through the scratch. Then, a servocontrol is applied to trace the pit accurately.<br>This design is resistant to scratches, stains, sound pressure and vibration.<br><br>In addition to the 10 keys of 1 ~ 0, plus 10 keys of + 10 ~ + 50 are equipped for quick selection of music.<br><br>Equipped with 4 types of play modes.<br>You can select Track Play to play the first song or from the specified song to the last song, Single Play to play only the specified song, Program Play to play the selected song in the order of selection, or Time Play to start playback from the specified time of the specified song.<br><br>Equipped with a digital display.<br>On this display, you can select five types : the elapsed time of the song and the elapsed time of the whole disc, the remaining time of the song and the remaining time of the whole disc, the elapsed time of the song only, the remaining time of the song, and no display.<br><br>It is equipped with functions such as repeat all songs, repeat a specific section, repeat one song, reserve a song, play the previous or next song, play from a favorite point, and index search.<br><br>It is equipped with a space key that automatically creates 4-second intervals between songs.<br><br>Equipped with an auto-close function that automatically closes the tray after leaving it open for 5 minutes.<br><br>Equipped with a power ON play function for timer play.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
