				<p class="detail">This is the first cassette deck equipped with a digital level monitor.<br><br>Equipped with a digital level monitor.<br>When recording in the auto-attenuator OFF mode, if the input level exceeds the recommended recording level of the tape, the excess is digitally displayed in units of 1 dB. This allows you to set the recording level precisely in units of 1 dB.<br><br>Equipped with auto-attenuator function.<br>When the input level exceeds the recommended recording level of the tape during recording or recording pause, the excess amount is automatically attenuated. When recording from a source that requires rerecording, the level is temporarily set to a level that you think is a little higher in the recording pause state, and the level is automatically lowered to the optimum level by playing back. Then you can return to the head of the source and start recording to take full advantage of the dynamic range of the tape.<br><br>A laser amorphous head is used for the recording / reproducing head.<br>This head is made of amorphous magnetic alloy without crystal structure by applying laser processing technology, and has obtained excellent SN ratio and frequency characteristics.<br><br>Equipped with a cassette stabilizer.<br>This prevents rattling when the cassette is mounted and prevents modulation noise.<br><br>The counter uses a linear electronic counter that digitally displays the running cost of the tape in minutes and seconds.<br>In addition, it is equipped with a pre-end winker, and when the remaining amount of the tape reaches a few minutes during recording, the counter will blink to inform you.<br><br>Equipped with auto fader function, fade in / out can be done with one touch operation.<br><br>Equipped with an auto tape selector, the bias / equalizer corresponding to the type of tape is automatically set using the detection hole of the half.<br>It is also equipped with a forced switching button so that it can cope with cassettes without detection holes.<br><br>As a noise reduction system, Dolby B type and C type are mounted.<br>The newly developed symmetrical process Dolby IC is used for the IC. When the Dolby circuit is turned ON, the MPX filter is also turned ON automatically, preventing the Dolby from malfunctioning due to the pilot signal of FM broadcasting.<br><br>Equipped with a peak program meter.<br>It is a Oatley set type peak hold that holds the peak value for approximately 4 seconds and a double indication system that simultaneously displays the level that changes every moment.<br><br>Equipped with an audio memory function.<br>This function can store five items : recording level, recording balance of left and right channels, lineout / headphone level, Dolby Noise Reduction System OFF/B/C, and auto-attenuator ON/OFF.<br>The memory capacity can be stored up to 2 A/B memories for each tape position, a total of 8 memories.<br><br>Equipped with a digital level display function, you can switch between Rec Level, Rec Bal, and Line out/Phone to display.<br>Rec level displays the recording level, Rec bal displays the difference in 1 dB steps, and Line out/Phon displays the output level during playback and the volume level of the headphones in 2 dB steps.<br><br>Electronic volume is used for the volume part.<br><br>Lithium battery backup format is adopted, and display information including tape counter value at the time when AC power is turned off is stored.<br><br>Equipped with a cue (AMS for one song) convenient for tape playback and a music scan.<br><br>Equipped with a function memory, it can store up to 8 steps of 4 buttons of play / rewind / fast forward / counter reset.<br><br>Equipped with a Rec Mute mechanism with autospace, it creates a no-signal part and moves to the recording pose, so you can make a tape with a uniform interval between songs.<br><br>Equipped with a timer standby mechanism.<br><br>You can control the deck from a remote location by combining the optional Wireless Remote Control RM-80, Wired Remote Control RM-50, and Foot Remote Control Unit RM-51.<br>In addition, by combining with the RM-65 synchronized remote control unit, synchronized operation combined with Sony&#39;s player system is possible.</p>
