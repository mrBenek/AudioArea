				<p class="detail">Cassette deck equipped with pulse servo DD motor.<br><br>The mechanism section is equipped with a pulse servo DD motor developed for cassette decks based on DD phono motor technology.<br>The basic shape of this motor is a 4-phase, 8-pole, flat-facing brushless, slotless, coreless, FG servo direct drive. The brushless structure developed by Victor Central R &amp; D Laboratories, in which the Hall element switches polarity, eliminates mechanical contacts, improves the rotational accuracy and extends the life of the motor. The brushless, coreless, and slotless structures eliminate noise and rotational irregularities such as cocking.<br>The pulse servo DD motor uses a frequency generator to detect the number of revolutions. Since it is an all-round integration type with 204 poles and 102 pulses, there is no detection error due to positional deviation. In addition, to prevent positional deviation from the beginning, the FG magnet is coaxial with the capstan and is magnetized while maintaining the center of the substrate. In addition, an auto-balance circuit is mounted to prevent torque fluctuation due to temperature rise.<br><br>The flywheels are made of compound materials that are effective against modulation noise, eliminating flutter components and high-frequency nigori caused by squeal (vibration).<br><br>An all-DC configuration amplifier is adopted.<br>Since the DC configuration amplifier can reduce the number of signal capacitors, the distortion, noise and phase change caused by the capacitor are reduced, and the transient characteristics are also improved. In particular, the head amplifier is a direct coupling using a double differential amplifier, and the microphone amplifier, recording amplifier and ANRS circuit are also DC configuration amplifiers with ± 2 power supplies. All the amplifiers that pass audio signals are DC configuration.<br><br>A NewSA (Senalloy) head is used for the recording / reproducing head.<br>In the NewSA head, the number of laminated cores has been changed by 12 sheets, twice that of the conventional SA head, and eddy current loss and hysteresis loss are further reduced, and high-frequency characteristics and high-frequency noise are improved. In addition to doubling the number of laminated cores, the diameter of windings is increased to reduce DC resistance, thereby suppressing low-frequency noise caused by DC resistance.<br><br>An SA (Sen Alloy) erase head is used for the erase head.<br><br>Full logic control is adopted.<br><br>ANRS and SuperANRS are installed as noise reduction systems.<br><br>Equipped with 2-color FL level meter with peak hold.<br>This level meter is an 18-segment, 20-dot, 1-segment fluorescent display with more than 0 VU of red color.<br><br>Equipped with a timer standby mechanism and by connecting an optional timer, it is possible to record the absence and play the alarm clock.<br>It also has a timer safety lock to prevent accidental erasure.<br><br>Equipped with a rec mute mechanism.<br><br>Equipped with auto-rewind mechanism.<br><br>It has a playback volume linked to the headphone.<br><br>Equipped with a remote control terminal, it can be operated from a remote location by connecting an optional remote control.</p>
