				<p class="detail">CD player announced as a special edition model of VRDS-10.<br><br>The VRDS mechanism is used for the mechanism part.<br>In this mechanism, the disc is clamped on a high-mass turntable with the same diameter as the disc, thereby eliminating the inherent vibration of the disc itself and unnecessary vibration of the mechanism system. In addition, by giving an extremely gentle inclination to the disc crimping surface, the warpage and distortion of the disc are corrected. The pickup, which is finely adjusted to the same angle as the turntable, always realizes pit reading at the center of the pickup optical axis. This greatly improves the relative optical axis accuracy between the optical pickup and the disc pit surface, and minimizes unnecessary servo current.<br>The VRDS-10SE uses high-precision die-cast aluminum for the turntable and a thick reinforced rib bridge for rigid support. The mechanical base is made of a special polymer material with a low coefficient of thermal expansion and resistance to temperature changes. Moreover, it has twice the specific gravity of ABS resin.<br>The motor section uses a brushless Hall motor that boasts high torque, and has acquired rotational stability and high durability.<br><br>The D/A converter uses a bit stream conversion DAC7 without 0 cross distortion in principle.<br>In the VRDS-10SE, the SAA7350, which boasts excellent signal characteristics, is used separately for the left and right channels, and the TDA1547 &quot;DAC7&quot; is joined to both channels to improve sound quality in a double differential mode.<br>With this differential circuit, interference between the left and right channels and even harmonics are canceled, and the SN ratio is dramatically improved.<br><br>The digital filter uses a 20-bit 8 x oversampling digital filter.<br><br>The body has a double-top panel structure with a top panel in the lower layer of the bonnet. In addition, cushioning materials are carefully placed between the double-top panels to increase the damping effect, and these are fixed to the chassis body by seven point fasteners.<br>In addition, the chassis body uses a separate block construction divided into eight parts. In addition to the independent front and rear chassis, a center chassis for the mechanism is installed. In addition, two sub-chassis for the mechanism and floating are connected to the side chassis. In particular, the center chassis, which directly connects the front and rear panels, forms an H-shaped beam structure. This greatly increases the rigidity of the entire body.<br>In the VDDS-10SE, the thickness of the middle top plate is set to 1.6 mm a non-resonance design.<br><br>Interference between digital and analog circuits is minimized by using separate boards.<br><br>Audio condensers and high-precision metal-coated resistors are fully employed, and very thick OFC cables are attached to the power cords to improve sound quality.<br><br>Equipped with CN servo to reduce noise components caused by servo current.<br><br>5 mm thick high-density front panel and solid aluminum tray top panel.</p>
