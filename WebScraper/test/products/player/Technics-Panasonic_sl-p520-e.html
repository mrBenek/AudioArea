				<p class="detail">Based on the high sound quality design inherited from SL-P1200 and SL-P720 such as classAA sample and hold circuit and super clean digital filter, this CD player is equipped with various functions such as 2 speed search dial and preset editing function.<br><br>By using two different amplifiers for voltage control and current supply, we have adopted Technics&#39;s unique classAA method which fundamentally eliminates the effect of load fluctuation on waveform transmission.<br>The SL-P520 uses this method for its sample-and-hold circuit.<br><br>It employs a newly developed 96th order digital filter (MN6618A) that is integrated into a single-chip LSI with a high-precision digital processor that excels in phase characteristics (county delay characteristics) and flattening frequency characteristics in the band. It is combined with a high-precision analog low-pass filter to form a unique super-clean digital filter.<br>This eliminates unwanted noise components and improves sound quality without compromising audio characteristics.<br><br>It uses a unique single-beam system that has high laser light utilization efficiency and greatly improves the S / N ratio of 3-beam system.<br>Together with the adoption of digital accu-servo systems with high signal reproduction capability, we have achieved high playability against scratches and fingerprints on the disc surface.<br>In addition, the spindle motor uses a brushless D. D. motor to ensure high reliability and durability.<br><br>To prevent noise from the digital circuit and servo circuit to the audio circuit, the power supply for the audio circuit is independent of the power supply for the digital / servo circuit to eliminate interference between the circuits.<br>For audio circuit components, we are pursuing higher sound quality by using copper foil Styrofoam capacitors and audio electrolytic capacitors.<br><br>It uses Technics&#39; own floating optical system to reduce the adverse effect of vibration from the floor.<br>First of all, four insulators block vibration transmitted to the player body, and in addition, the most important optical deck is floated from the body together with the loading mechanism to realize vibration damping.<br>Special rubber vibration isolators are also used on the top panel to completely eliminate resonance.<br><br>Equipped with a 2-speed search dial that enables fine head detection in both forward and reverse directions with fingertips.<br>The playback speed can be selected between approximately 1 second (slow) and approximately 30 seconds (fast) per rotation. If the playback speed is set to the slow side, ultra-precise access in units of at least 3 frames (1/25 second) is possible.<br>This is useful for timing adjustment when editing tapes.<br><br>A high-precision linear motor is adopted in the drive part of the traverse mechanism that moves the pickup, and a high-speed heading of 0.9 seconds on average is realized by a control system that utilizes a microcomputer.<br>In addition, there is no reduction mechanism such as a gear belt, and quietness and durability are improved.<br><br>It is equipped with a preset editing function that is convenient when you select your favorite music from a CD and edit it on a tape.<br>The tape recording time is memorized in advance, and when the TIME MODE key is pressed during the program, the total playing time of the programmed song is automatically calculated and the remaining time of the tape is displayed.<br>This allows for streamlined tape editing.<br><br>With the included remote control, you can directly select songs with 10 keys, program 20 songs randomly, adjust from -12dB to 0 dB in increments of 2 dB with a digital attenuator, and operate a programmable music scan function that allows you to play only the intro part of a song sequentially.</p>
