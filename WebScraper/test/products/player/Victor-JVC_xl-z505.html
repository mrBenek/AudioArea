				<p class="detail">A CD player with technologies such as K2 interface and DD converter.<br><br>The D/A converter is equipped with a DD (Digital Direct) converter developed from a 1-bit DAC using original technology.<br>In principle, the 1-bit DAC does not generate 0 cross distortion due to amplitude error, so the micro-level reproduction capability, which was difficult with the ladder-type DAC, is greatly enhanced. However, since 16-bit CD data is represented by 1-bit pulse waves, the reproducibility is greatly affected by the noise shaper that improves data compression error and the resolution of pulse waves.<br>The DD converter uses a VANS noise shaper for bit compression to express 16-bit precision data with 1-bit pulse wave operation. This enables fourth order noise shaping, which was previously limited to the third order, to achieve higher precision conversion.<br>In addition, the DD converter is equipped with a PEM (Pulse Edge Modulation) circuit, which generates two pulse waves and utilizes the time difference between the rise and fall of each pulse wave. This realizes high resolution and high precision more than twice that of conventional systems.<br><br>It is equipped with a newly developed fine clock generator to support digital direct recording of CD in SCMS DAT standard.<br>In this circuit, the master clock generation circuit incorporated in the conventional D/A converter is made independent and shielded to eliminate interference with peripheral circuits, thereby improving the quality of digital signal output.<br><br>It has a unique K2 interface circuit.<br>The K2 interface circuit takes note of the fact that sound quality changes due to jitter (time difference distortion) and ripple (waveform distortion) that occur in digital signals. By reading only code information from digital transmission signals and recreating the same music signal, digital distortion that cannot be eliminated by conventional waveform shaping is eliminated.<br><br>The K2 interface and DD converter are provided with a synchronous signal from a precise fine clock generator for more precise conversion.<br><br>In order to eliminate transmission loss, not only analog circuits but also digital signal circuits are pursuing the shortest and efficient layout along the signal flow. In addition, in order to eliminate mutual interference between each circuit, the separation structure is also taken into consideration. In particular, a full-scale shield panel is installed for the first time in this class against microcomputer noise leaking from the FL display.<br>The D/A separation type is also used for the power supply.<br><br>It uses a center mechanism in which the rotating system is located near the center of gravity of the main body, and realizes more accurate pickup operation by reducing vibration structurally.<br><br>In order to completely eliminate vibration, the chassis base adopts a ladder frame chassis reinforced with a 1.6 mm thick steel plate with a unique frame, thereby strengthening bending rigidity and suppressing vibration from the outside.<br>In addition, vibration is reduced by mounting a pickup system on the ladder frame chassis via a mechanical arc base. This mechanical arc base is an evolution of the arc base, which was born from the same robust structure as the foundation of the building. It uses foamed high-density resin that boasts a high vibration damping rate.<br><br>The top cover beam is used on the upper part of the chassis to prevent the noise of the top plate and to reinforce the front and rear panels.<br><br>Equipped with a triple editing system that can perform two mode tape editing.<br>With this function, you can perform editing that fits within the specified time. With auto-edit, you can perform one touch editing according to the order of songs by leaving it to the microcomputer, and with program edit, you can program according to the order of songs you like.<br><br>Equipped with a display ON/OFF function to prevent microcomputer noise.<br><br>Equipped with a dimmer switch that can adjust the brightness.<br><br>There are 2 color variations, gun-metallic and black.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
