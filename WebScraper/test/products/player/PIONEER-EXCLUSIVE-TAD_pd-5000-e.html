				<p class="detail">A reference CD player developed by combining Pioneer&#39;s proprietary laser and digital technology, servo technology, and non-resonance technology.<br><br>Equipped with 8 fs real 18 bit direct linear conversion.<br>First, the 8 x oversampling digital filter uses a high-precision LSI with an operation word length of 20x22bit to improve the calculation accuracy. In addition to obtaining high-precision data, the sampling frequency is shifted up 8 times to 352.8 kHz, increasing the density of quantized data and reducing the load on the analog filter.<br>In addition, the D/A converter uses the ハンドピックド Pioneer Super Version of the one package real 18 bitLSI one package real 18, especially with regard to linearity and low-level distortion.<br>In addition, by using the リニアベロープ method to adjust each bit to an appropriate value one by one, high-precision D/A conversion is achieved by converting not only MSB, which has a high importance of pit errors, but also 2 sb, 3 sb, and 4 sb to minimize errors.<br>This greatly reduces the distortion caused by 0 cross distortion and bit error.<br><br>In order to minimize the signal path, a CD direct conversion is adopted, and the signal path from the pickup to the output terminal is minimized and each circuit block is arranged properly.<br>For this reason, the main circuit is laid out at the shortest distance along the signal flow, such as by placing the optical system mechanism in the center. Moreover, the wiring materials are also made as short as possible to minimize exposure.<br><br>In order to make CD direct construction more thorough and effective, digital and servo, analog circuit board and power circuit board are separated independently. Moreover, analog circuit board adopts full monoconstruction of Lch and Rch from the digital data stage in pursuit of homogeneity of Lch and Rch, reducing interference between signals.<br>In addition, it uses a sealed PCB (double-sided substrate) that achieves low impedance grounding and provides effective shielding against digital noise. In addition, low-impedance 70 μ m ultra-thick OFC (oxygen-free copper) substrates are used for Lch/Rch analog substrates and power supply substrates.<br><br>The pickup is equipped with an in-house developed clean laser pickup with improved laser efficiency.<br>By reducing the number of optical components such as the collimator lens, the power loss of the optical system is greatly reduced compared with conventional pickups, and the aberration in the optical path is also reduced, enabling more accurate signal pickup.<br>A built-in I/V in I/V conversion head amplifier. The laser beam that bounces off the pit surface is converted into an electric signal of several microamperes by the photodetector. In the clean laser pickup, the photodetector has a built-in I/V amplifier and is amplified to approximately 200 mv order, so that a signal resistant to disturbance noise can be sent out.<br><br>In order to obtain highly accurate RF signals from pit signals, we have adopted an Accu-Focus system.<br>When a four part photodetector for focus servo receives a laser beam, a phase difference occurs due to the time difference between the preceding signal and the following signal, causing a disturbance in the synthesized RF signal. In the Accu-Focus system, a delay circuit delays the preceding signal to match the phase with the following signal.<br>As a result, a high-output RF signal with few read errors can be obtained.<br><br>The power transformer is a twin power transformer configuration in which analog circuits and digital / servo circuits are completely separated to prevent mutual interference between analog and digital / servo circuits.<br>In particular, we have adopted bifilar twist windings made of OFC wire for the windings of transformers for audio circuits, increasing the balance of ± voltage and output impedance of the power supply to the level of ± 2 transformer system, and improving driving performance in the low-frequency range.<br>In addition, a 4-core OFC cord is used for the power cord, and the analog circuit and digital / servo circuit are independent from the power plug to prevent the inflow of digital noise from the power supply.<br>Moreover, to prevent vibration and induction noise generated by the power transformer from being transmitted to the main body, the transformer is mounted on an isorated base, which is an extremely thick aluminum angle separated from the main chassis. Moreover, the isorated base floats with the main body and is supported by special brass legs.<br><br>The power supply unit uses a push-pull power supply system.<br>Current control elements are installed in parallel so that the power supply voltage can be stabilized by controlling the current control elements when the load current suddenly changes. In addition, high stability is achieved by increasing the number of discrete components and introducing high-quality sound devices. This suppresses fluctuations in the power supply voltage and improves the transient response characteristics. In addition to realizing low impedance, the harmonic distortion of the power supply is also kept low.<br>In addition, a 2-transformer, 4-part, 19-regulator, low-impedance 70 μ m ultra-thick OFC (oxygen-free copper) substrate is used to prevent interference between blocks.<br><br>A class A operation FET buffer amplifier is used in all stages after the D/A converter. By reducing the load of each stage and reducing the output impedance of the amplifier as a whole, the analog section is not affected by capacitance components such as low-pass filters which become the load of the amplifier.<br>By using Class-A operation, fluctuation of power consumption during operation can be reduced, and low distortion factor is realized.<br><br>The spindle motor of the disk drive mechanism is equipped with a high-torque coreless D. D. spindle motor with a starting torque of 65g/cm. In addition, the spindle diameter is extremely large (4.5 mm), making it resistant to load fluctuations and providing stable disk drive performance.<br>In addition, a high-speed linear motor with fast tracking response is used for the pickup drive to realize accurate tracing and high-speed access with an average of 0.5 seconds or less.<br><br>Taking note of the adverse effect of disc resonance on sound quality, we have adopted a vertical clamp type disc stabilizer that improves mounting accuracy with the disc.<br>In addition, it employs a magnet catch system without mechanical contact between the stabilizer and clamper, which thoroughly reduces unnecessary vibration of the disk and ensures smooth rotation.<br><br>Lamisert mechanical base is adopted as the mechanical base supporting the optical mechanism.<br>This is made by molding two sheets of steel plate with special resin. Furthermore, by plating the steel plate on the pickup side with copper, vibration damping characteristics are improved and the influence of magnetic strain is eliminated.<br>Also, this mechanical base is fixed to a ceramic support called ceramic mechanical support via a coaxial suspension, which is a special rubber and spring integrated coaxially, and blocks vibration from the chassis.<br><br>The chassis uses a copper-plated hybrid honeycomb chassis, an evolution of the honeycomb chassis.<br>First, the honeycomb chassis is plated with copper to achieve excellent vibration control and reduced magnetic distortion. In addition, superfine pile is electrostatically implanted on the floor side of the honeycomb chassis to suppress high-frequency reflection from the floor and minute vibration on the chassis surface. This enables total control from unwanted vibration with large amplitude to minute vibration.<br>Large-size honeycomb insulators made of special resin molded into a honeycomb shape are used as insulators.<br><br>It is equipped with a clean microcomputer that starts scanning only when the operation key is pressed to reduce noise. In addition, it is also equipped with a display-off switch that turns off the display when it is not necessary, paying attention to the slight scanning noise that occurs when the display turns on.<br>In addition, it is equipped with a digital analogout change-over switch that stops the operation of unused circuits and prevents noise contamination.<br><br>The front panel uses a lacquer style panel made of extra-thick extruded aluminum material.<br><br>It is equipped with 2 systems of digital out which is coaxial with light.<br><br>It is equipped with a time location function that can locate in units of 1 second in a stop state.</p>
