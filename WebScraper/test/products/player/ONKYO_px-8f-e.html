				<p class="detail">A full auto player with a straight arm.<br><br>The tone arm is lighter in weight to improve the followability of the arm itself, and by skillfully setting the resonance point of the arm, adverse effects such as warping of records are eliminated as much as possible.<br>In the PX-8F, by adopting a straight arm, the effective equivalent mass is reduced to 15g, which is about half of the conventional S-type arm.<br>In addition, Pyrofil Carbon Fiber is used as the material. Carbon fiber with a diameter of 8 microns is hardened into a thin film with a thickness of only 0.125 mm by a special treatment method, laminated in three directions in different fiber directions, and shaped and polished into a pipe shape using a high-precision mandrel. This has the advantages of being free from rust and distortion over time, and having a shielding effect because it is conductive.<br><br>For the tone arm support part, ultra-precision finished miniature bearings subjected to high heat hardening are used, and the feather support system which is very light in both vertical direction and shaft rotation direction is adopted, and the initial motion sensitivity shows an excellent value of 6.8 mg in center value.<br>In addition, an ADC-type connector is used for the shell attachment / detachment part. Sliding pins with spring effect have a large contact area, do not easily become dirty, and have a self-cleaning effect by sliding, thus reducing the probability of contact failure.<br><br>To detect the end of the record, we have adopted a completely non-side pressure system using photoelectric sensing elements.<br>The near-infrared interrupter, which consists of a light-blocking shutter and photoelectric elements installed on the arm rotating shaft, detects the change in the amount of light entering the phototransistor within a certain period of time, and operates the return mechanism. It detects the large swing of the arm in the eccentric groove at the end of the record, and instantly performs functional processing of the change in the amount of light to identify the difference from the sound groove trace. This prevents accidents such as inadvertent return of the arm during performance.<br><br>Uses a 20-pole, 30-slot quartz lock system high-torque DD motor.<br>A frequency generator (FG) attached to the motor shaft detects the number of revolutions, and the detected signal is compared with an accurate reference signal obtained by dividing the frequency from a 5.52960 MHz crystal oscillator to compensate for slight disturbances in the rotation.<br>In addition, the frequency generator employs an all-round integration type to cancel even a slight manufacturing error on the circumference, and constitutes a highly stable quartz PLL circuit.<br><br>The turntable is a large turntable with a weight of 2.2 kg and a diameter of 33 cm. The dynamic balance of each product is checked and a precision finish is applied to obtain the optimum mass distribution. The turntable is 380 kg ・ cm.<sup>2</sup>Moment of inertia.<br><br>Equipped with continuously variable vari-pitch that can freely control the number of revolutions.<br>The number of revolutions of the record can be freely and continuously varied within ± 5.9% of the chromatic scale, and the amount of change can be checked every 1% with the front LED indicator.<br><br>A high-density particle board 15 mm thick is used for the cabinet, and a special shock absorber 3 mm thick is placed between it and the floor board, and it is supported by a composite acoustic insulator. This is a double insulation structure.<br>The insulator consists of a spiral coil spring that is particularly effective in low frequencies and a special shape rubber vibration isolator that is highly effective in middle and high frequencies. The resonance frequency formed by the total weight of the player and the compliance of the coil spring is approximately 10 Hz, and excellent vibration damping effect is obtained in the audible frequency band above this.</p>
