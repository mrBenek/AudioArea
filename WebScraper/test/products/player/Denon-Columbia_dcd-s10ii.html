				<p class="detail">This CD player is the successor to the S10 that adopts a new anti-vibration mechanism.<br><br>In addition to the center mechanical mount, which has high structural stability, a mechanical cover is used to reduce the influence on circuits with many drive mechanisms. In addition, Exaine, a vibration absorbing material, is attached to the sintered alloy insulator that converts vibration into heat and suppresses propagation to the chassis, further suppressing propagation of vibration.<br>The 15 mm thick front panel and double-structured bottom and top covers completely eliminate sound quality degradation due to vibration from the inside and outside.<br><br>A hybrid structure loader is used for the tray part.<br>The tray is coated with a highly vibration-proof protein-containing paint to reduce unnecessary vibration.<br>In addition, the adoption of a lightweight and highly rigid aluminum diecast shaft receiver that is highly effective in suppressing vibrations, a plate is attached to the lower part of the tray to prevent subtle deformation of the tray due to disk rotation, ensuring stable rotation and absorbing vibrations.<br><br>Bearings are used in the main body receiving part of the tray rail to realize smooth tray drive.<br>This not only ensures accurate tray storage but also ensures that the tray is securely held to minimize the impact of vibration on sound.<br><br>It is equipped with an ALPHA processor which is a unique analog waveform reproduction technology.<br>By interpolating signals lost when recorded as digital data on CDs and other media, and by making the sound as close as possible to the sound that should have existed before recording, we reproduce a smooth waveform that is close to analog. In addition, quantization distortion, which was the destiny of digital, has been greatly reduced, and reproduction performance closer to the original sound has been obtained.<br><br>DENON&#39;s original Lambda S. L. C. is used for the D/A conversion part.<br>In this method, digital data is separated into two systems, each of which is shifted near the 0 cross point by applying digital bias in + and - directions, thereby eliminating 0 cross distortion in principle.<br>In combination with a multi-bit high-precision 20-bit D/A converter that converts analog signals at high speed, the dynamic range is greatly improved.<br><br>Equipped with a digital input terminal, it can also be used as a D/A converter.<br>The Output selector on the main unit allows you to select the Digital Out.<br><br>The pickup section uses a simple structure with high performance.<br>Combined with the adoption of a hybrid structure loader section that completely suppresses vibration, accurate signal reading is realized.<br>In addition, by reducing the number of parts, trace accuracy and durability / reliability have been improved.<br><br>In order to prevent the deterioration of sound quality due to the influence of digital signals, the digital circuit and analog circuit are completely separated, and the transformer and circuit board are also separated.<br>The digital system is compact to minimize interference with the analog system and the highly conductive copper-plated chassis reduces the influence of electromagnetic waves on sound.<br><br>Digital servo is used for the servo circuit.<br>The optimum servo amount is detected for each disk, and the servo amount is adjusted according to the disk.<br><br>We use carefully selected materials including ICs such as D/A converters, resistors, capacitors, and wiring materials.<br>In addition, the power cable uses a detachable extra-thick AC cord made of OFC wire.<br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
