				<p class="detail">A CD player with a real 18-bit optical converter.<br><br>It uses an optical converter that uses stable electrical energy derived from pure light energy as an analog signal source. This provides a dedicated power supply that is completely independent from the power supply to other circuits. As a result, fluctuations in power supply voltage due to the operation of all circuits and mixing of digital noise are prevented, and the purity of music signals is increased.<br><br>For digital-to-analog conversion, high-precision 18-bit D/A converters are installed in an independent 2 dac configuration on the left and right sides.<br>This 18-bit D/A converter performs D/A conversion at four times the resolution of 16-bit to improve the conversion accuracy, and the quantization noise is 1/4.<br>The C-701XD D/A converter is, in principle, an 18-bit charge-transfer-type D/A converter using C-MOS without 0 cross distortion. It can be driven with almost no current, so it is not affected by digital noise and has high sound quality.<br><br>The digital filter uses an independent left / right 18-bit 4-times oversampling digital filter.<br>The sampling frequency is shifted up four times to 176.4 kHz, and unnecessary high-order noise is shifted to the high-frequency range. It is removed by a low-pass filter with gentle cut-off characteristics summarized by the sense of hearing.<br><br>In order to prevent noise from entering the analog circuit from the digital circuit, the digital circuit. By converting the digital signal into an optical switching signal and transmitting it, the loop is electrically disconnected, preventing digital noise from entering the analog circuit.<br>The optical transmission element uses an optolink module that connects the transmitting and receiving elements with optical fibers, and the speed has been increased up to 3 times.<br><br>In order to eliminate vibration interference from inside and outside, it adopts a double chassis structure in which two types of special damping materials are sandwiched between two chassis. The rigidity is strengthened by overlapping two chassis, and vibration is absorbed by the damping material inside.<br><br>In order to suppress interference between each circuit, a separator is installed between the power supply block and the circuit block to separate them, thereby eliminating the invasion of magnetic flux.<br><br>The pickup uses the same mechanism as the C-901XD. The pickup is driven by a newly developed linear slide motor mechanism that allows high-speed access and reduces vibration.<br>In this mechanism, the strength of the mechanism is increased by using high-rigidity material, and vibration is controlled by isolating each part by using special spring and non-repulsion rubber at the mounting part. In addition, we have developed a heavy-weight hybrid die-cast tray that combines two kinds of metals, i.e., damping zinc die-cast and aluminum structural material, to increase vibration control effect.<br><br>Digital / analog exclusive power supply with separate digital / analog windings is adopted.<br><br>Super servo amplifier configuration is adopted.<br><br>With the Time Edit function, when recording from a CD to a cassette, by entering the tape size of the cassette, the number of songs to be recorded on the A side and B side and the accumulated time are displayed.<br><br>Equipped with output level volume and headphone port.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
