				<p class="detail">Based on the tape transport of 0.07% wow flutter verified in A-450, this stereo cassette deck incorporates various optimum recording mechanisms that bring out the capabilities of the tape.<br><br>In the mechanism part, the wow flutter characteristics are improved by adopting a 90 mm fly hole. In addition, durability and accuracy are further improved by making the capstan shaft 2.5 mm φ thick. In addition, slip and aging change are reduced by adopting a new flat belt polished by excellent polishing technology.<br>The holder is designed to hold the cassette half firmly. When the cassette half is placed on the base plate and pushed slightly, it is sucked from the middle and fixed completely. The base plate after the cassette half is mounted is pulled down by the spring so that the cassette half does not float during operation.<br>It is a 2-step action type in which the cassette goes up when you press it further, and the top lid can be opened and closed freely even during play.<br><br>A new slip ring mechanism that applies constant tension to the left and right reel stands has been adopted, resulting in less sound skipping and stable tape travel with no need to worry about tape being wound.<br><br>The drive system has been simplified as much as possible to improve overall accuracy and reduce wow flutter.<br>Only the idler that winds the tape touches the capstan and capstan and flywheel, not the fast-forward or rewind drive system.<br><br>In order to bring out the performance of the tape, it is equipped with 3-stage switching mechanism independent of bias equalizer.<br>In addition, the Chrometape equalizer uses a 70 μ s equalizer based on the new DIN standard to further improve the frequency characteristics and SN ratio. Compared to the conventional 120 μ s equalizer, the SN ratio is improved by approximately 4.5 dB (10 kHz) because the compensation amount in the high-frequency range is less.<br><br>Equipped with an expanded type level meter with excellent transient characteristics and a wide scale.<br>In addition, a peak level indicator using a light-emitting diode (LED) is mounted so that the level meter can cope with more intense sound than it can handle. This indicator lights up from the point of + 6 dB where the distortion begins to increase.<br><br>In order to properly adjust the operating level of the Dolby system, there are six calibrations for each channel and each tape position independently, and a playback calibration mechanism for each channel independently, with adjustments for each tape.<br><br>In order to improve the S / N ratio of the recording microphone, an input selector that directly feeds the microphone and line inputs is incorporated. This is more than 15 dB better than conventional methods.<br><br>A stabilizing power supply circuit is built in to respond to the reference operation level which is also affected by the fluctuation of the power supply voltage.<br><br>The head is equipped with an HD (high density) ferrite head.<br><br>Equalizer amplifiers for recording and playback, including line amplifiers, are designed to provide a wider range of frequencies and flatter characteristics. Bias, which affects recording characteristics, raises the oscillation frequency to 100 kHz and reduces waveform distortion, enabling high-frequency recording.<br><br>It is equipped with a multiplex (MPX) filter that cuts out unwanted signals when recording an FM stereo broadcast transmission.<br><br>Equipped with a memory counter.<br><br>Equipped with an electronic auto end stop mechanism that stops automatically when the tape is finished winding.<br><br>Equipped with a tape run pilot amplifier.</p>
