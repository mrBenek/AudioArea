				<p class="detail">This is a stereo cassette deck with improved sound quality, mechanism and operability by incorporating state-of-the-art technologies and harmonizing them at a high level.<br><br>The head uses a 3-head system with Super GX head.<br>Low-noise crystal ferrite with high magnetic permeability and high saturation magnetic flux density is used for the core, and excellent performance is also shown in mechanical secondary characteristics such as abrasion resistance and dust adhesion resistance.<br><br>Equipped dolby C Type NR.<br>The C-type has a higher noise reduction effect than the B-type, a sliding band method for suppressing bleeding (breathing of noise), spectral skewing for greatly improving high-frequency characteristics, and an anti-frequency circuit. The C-type features improved saturation characteristics in the high-frequency range, as well as measures against sound quality degradation.<br><br>The recorder / re-amplifier is equipped with a ± 2 power source DC amplifier using carefully selected devices.<br>The playback amplifier consists of a first stage differential amplifier and SEPP configuration with dual FET and dual transistor, and a direct coupling configuration to the playback head.<br>In addition, the recording amplifier uses an IC operational amplifier with excellent linearity and the power supply section is reinforced to improve sound quality such as low distortion rate, wide dynamic range, and stable phase characteristics.<br><br>The mechanism uses a closed-loop double-capstan transport mechanism and a direct-drive system to achieve high-precision tape travel.<br>The two capstans firmly grip the tape in the head section and give a certain tension to the tape, which absorbs minute vibrations of the tape during driving and greatly reduces modulation noise.<br>The capstan drive motor uses an FG servo DD motor that boasts high rotational accuracy and high torque to achieve low wow and flutter. In addition, the high torque DC-motor reel drive mechanism and unique tape guide are used to further enhance the quality of the drive system.<br><br>It uses a quick and quiet mechanism in which a microcomputer controls the setting of each mode by controlling a dedicated motor.<br>This minimizes the mechanism, and in addition, the head block is lifted up to the pose position even in the stop state, so that the start up speed during play operation is also faster.<br><br>Equipped with an auto tape tuning mechanism.<br>First, data is recorded and rerecorded with a 1 kHz reference signal, the level is coarsely adjusted, and the bias setting is started. The bias setting point is one step 3% and 32 steps. Rch is chosen as a representative, and the result of changing the bias from two directions is averaged. From shallow to deep gradually, from deep to shallow. On the other hand, from deep to shallow, from shallow to shallow. This method is highly accurate in that the point four steps over this average value is determined as the optimum bias value.<br>Then, the equalizer and recording / resensitivity are adjusted based on the reference level of 1 kHz at three frequencies of 5 kHz, 7 kHz and 15 kHz to achieve a flat frequency response.<br>This mechanism takes about 17 seconds, rewinds upon completion, and becomes a recording standby.<br>In addition, this tuning data is automatically stored in the microcomputer for each tape position, and is equipped with a tuning-rec position. When recording with a timer, automatic tape tuning is performed before recording.<br><br>It is equipped with a REC cancel mechanism. If you press this button when the recording timing is wrong, recording immediately stops, rewinds to between songs, and performs silent recording for for about 4 seconds and becomes recording standby.<br><br>Equipped with an intro-scan function, if you press the FF and PLAY buttons at the same time, the head of the song from the next song to the end of the tape is automatically skipped and played for 10 seconds at a time.<br><br>Equipped with IPLS (Automatic Heading) function, when the auto system switch is in IPLS mode and the FF or RWD button is pressed, the head of the next or current song is automatically found and play starts.<br><br>In the memory counter mode, when RWD and PLAY are pressed simultaneously, the counter will rewind to the counter 0000 position and play will start automatically.<br><br>It is equipped with an auto-fader. When the Fade button is pressed during recording standby, the recording level automatically fades in within 5 seconds. When the Fade button is pressed during recording, the recording automatically fades out. After 4 seconds of silent recording, the recording is switched to recording standby.<br><br>Equipped with an auto monitor function, you can monitor the source side during recording standby and switch to the tape monitor side as soon as recording starts so that you can check the recorded music from your head.<br><br>It is equipped with an auto mute function. If you press this button during recording, a silent recording is performed for 4 seconds and the recording standby mode is set.<br><br>The Auto Tape Selector automatically detects the tape position just by loading, and simultaneously sets the bias and equalizer to the input reference values.<br><br>Equipped with an FL bar meter with 18 segments in 2 colors for dual display of VU/PEAK switching.<br>The scale can be switched between VU and PEAK to ensure reading of the level. There is also a tape position indicator on the meter to indicate the warning zone of the maximum recording input level.<br><br>It is equipped with a timer start function that enables you to record messages and play an alarm clock.</p>
