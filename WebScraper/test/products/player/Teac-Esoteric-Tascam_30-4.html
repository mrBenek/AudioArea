				<p class="detail">A 4-channel tape deck equipped with a simulsink mechanism.<br>At that time, TASCAM was not branded, and 30-4 and 20-4 were named Tascam series.<br><br>The model 30-4 is an upgraded model of the A-3340S in detail, and it is equipped with a function selector with greatly improved switches so that the simulsync recording can be performed with as simple operation as possible.<br><br>It is equipped with a simulsync mechanism necessary for multiple recording.<br>When you overlay sound on a tape deck, the sound on each track must be completely synchronized. A typical tape deck has separate recording and playback heads, so if you overlay sound while monitoring playback sound, the sound will shift by the distance between the heads.<br>With the simulsync mechanism, the first recorded sound is monitored by the recording head, not by the reproducing head, so that it can be recorded directly onto another track without causing recording slippage between tracks.<br><br>Equipped with an output selector.<br>The SOURCE position adjusts the recording level. In this case, the input signal appears on the meter and output terminal. The SYNC position plays the sound with the recording head in a simul-sync mode. The input signal or simul-sync playback signal can be monitored in conjunction with the four function selectors on the left.<br>In the PLAY position, the playhead operates and the playback sound can be monitored.<br><br>The Function Selector functions as both a recording mode switch and a tape monitor switch.<br>When the Output Selector is in the SYNC position and the Function Selector is OFF, the SimulSync regenerating condition occurs and the Recording Mode is OFF. When the Function Selector is ON, the LED above the switch blinks and the Recording Mode is ON (Recording Standby) to monitor the input signal. With this Function Selector, you can switch both the Recording Mode ON/OFF and the Tape Monitor (Input / Excess Sync Playback) simultaneously with a single operation, simplifying the complex operation of multiple recording.<br><br>Equipped with a headphone selector, you can monitor the sound of any one to four channels individually or as a mix.<br>All signals are located at the center of the headphones.<br><br>Equipped with a pitch control function that works for both recording and playback, pitch adjustment of ± 6% (approximately half tone) is possible.<br><br>It has a built-in motion sensing mechanism that enables smooth operation of the mechanism.<br>When you move from fast forward or rewind to play, you don&#39;t have to wait for another action because the reel stops and immediately switches to play.<br><br>The microphone or line can be switched to each input channel with a switch.<br>When the microphone input is too large, the microphone attenuator attenuates the signal by 20 dB.<br><br>It is equipped with a cue mechanism that can be used to start a song.<br><br>Equipped with a reel clamper that allows one touch attachment of the reel.</p>
