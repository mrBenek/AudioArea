				<p class="detail">A three head cassette deck with technologies such as Computer Trek and Dolby C.<br><br>It is equipped with the COMPU-TREC function in order to record and play back under ideal conditions according to the slightly different characteristics of each tape.<br>Select the tape position (normal, chrome, or metal) with the tape select button. A special computer automatically adjusts, stores, and sets the bias, reference recording level, and equalizer characteristics that are essential for optimum recording through three test signals.<br>The settings are displayed on the LED peak level meter for visual confirmation, and the COMPU-TREC display flashes to indicate an error when the computer judges that the adjustment is impossible due to an error in setting the tape selector.<br>The calibration time is approximately five seconds and the tape is rewound to just before the start of the calibration.<br><br>Advanced SASF is used in the mechanism part to suppress modulation noise.<br>When the tape begins to rotate, it is rubbed by the mechanism or the head, causing slight expansion and contraction, resulting in very high-frequency longitudinal vibration (modulation noise).<br>The Advanced Active スプレープ Filter (SASF) has a structure in which a scrape filter, which rotates in conjunction with the capstan by means of an elastic belt, cancels the minute vibration of the tape. The scrape filter is a fly-wheel of the same diameter as the capstan and rotates in accordance with the tape running speed, so that more stable effects can be obtained. In addition, by using a tension servo with a tape tension detection arm, the tape tension is kept constant and the contact with the SASF roller is stabilized.<br>The advanced SASF reduces modulation noise by more than 10 dB.<br><br>The amplifier circuit uses a diamond differential circuit to provide a sufficient current margin even for transient input signals to improve the sound quality. In addition, the amplifier, mechanism and computer are each used as a dedicated power source for independent windings, with ± 2 power drive and DC configuration to form a full-scale amplifier circuit to improve the sound quality.<br><br>As a noise reduction system, both recording and playback are equipped with Dolby C, and simultaneous monitoring is possible even with Dolby ON.<br>In addition, a special IC developed exclusively for the Dolby B/C and a ± 2 power supply DC amplifier configuration have been devised to achieve high-quality noise reduction effects.<br><br>The head section is made of high-Bs ferrite with excellent magnetic properties. The gap length is optimized. The recording head and reproducing head are placed as close as possible in a close-gap combination structure. This makes up a 3-head system with excellent phase characteristics and high resolution.<br>Since the head spacing is narrow, the optimum head touch of a 2-head machine is obtained, and the signal delay when switching the tape monitor switch is also reduced.<br><br>When the recording level was set to REC pause, the tape monitor switch had to be switched to SOURCE. When the recording level was set to REC pause, the tape monitor switch had to be switched to TAPE. In addition, when the pause was released, recording was started, and simultaneous monitoring was desired, it had to be switched to TAPE.<br>The D-970 is equipped with a handoff monitor function. Even if the tape monitor switch is set to TAPE, it automatically switches to SOURCE at the time of recording pause, so that the sound does not stop even in the pause state.<br><br>The capstan motor uses a coreless type FG servo motor and realizes smooth tape travel by direct drive method. In addition, the capstan shaft is micro-grained to reduce unnecessary slip between the capstan and pinch roller.<br><br>Dual mode electronic counter is adopted, and 4-digit electronic counter can be switched to real-time counter.<br>In real-time mode, the time can be displayed on a time base by dividing the power supply frequency. Like a stopwatch, the time can be displayed in seconds. In this system, there is no error due to variations in tape thickness, which is seen in a system that detects the number of revolutions of the reel shaft.<br>The counter also supports other functions such as dual elasticity and repeat.<br><br>It is equipped with a dual memory repeat function that allows you to store and play between 2 points you like.<br>By resetting the counter at the first position and storing it at the position where you want to stop, you can repeat play between those 2 points.<br><br>Equipped with an auto REC mute function that creates a four second silent space.<br><br>Equipped with a tape lead-in function for sending lead tape portion.<br><br>Equipped with timer recording / playback function.<br><br>Equipped with 12 LED peak level peak level meter.<br><br>Equipped with output level volume.</p>
