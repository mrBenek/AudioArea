				<p class="detail">In commemoration of the 10th anniversary of the Eso Telic brand, this CD transport was developed by integrating accumulated technology and know-how.<br><br>The pickup part uses a lossless thread feed ultra-precision mechanism to pursue pit reading accuracy.<br>In this mechanism, the movement of the actuator, which adversely affects sound quality, is stopped, and the pickup feed drive at the submicron level is performed by the combination of precision ball screw lead screw and ball bearing machined at the micron level, and micro step control technology using 32 bit 20 mhz CPU. This enables the optical axis of the pickup to trace the center of the pit even for CD software with a large amount of eccentricity.<br><br>Newly developed VRDS mechanism is adopted for the mechanism part.<br>The P-0 VRDS features a newly designed high-torque 3-phase 8-pole spindle motor and a 3-point pinpoint support, high-precision machined steel 25 mm thick bearing bridge.<br><br>Digital servo is used for the servo circuit.<br>In the digital servo system, the gain of the three servo circuits of the tracking, focus and spindle can be set from the three positions of reference, standard and manual. The reference position is suitable for CD software with less defects such as surface deviation, eccentricity, fingerprint, scratches and black dots. In the manual position, the servo gain of the tracking, focus and spindle can be adjusted to the optimum value according to the individual disc.<br><br>The optical pickup uses a high-precision die-cast aluminum body.<br>In addition, an aluminum sand type high rigidity chassis and a pin-point 3-point support non-floating rigid mechanism are adopted for the chassis to eliminate the effect of vibration as much as possible.<br><br>The power supply section is independent of the main unit, and the internal section is composed of 3 transformers for output, servo and display separately.<br><br>It is equipped with a TOC creation program function that can play even on a CD disc that cannot be read in.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.<br><br></p>

			<p class="detail"><strong>About Version Upgrade Service</strong><br><br><strong>Upgrade to next-generation optical disks</strong><br>At the time of its release, it was planned to upgrade to a next-generation optical disk. However, due to the difficulty of complying with SACD, which was standardized in 1999, support for next-generation disks was discontinued.<br><br><strong>Upgrade to P-0s</strong><br>In the P-0s, new designs were introduced to the spindle motor control circuit for driving the turntable and the thread motor control circuit for driving the laser pickup, and improvements were made such as complete fixation of the bridge for the turntable and reinforcement of the shield of wires for various power supplies and signals.<br><br><strong>VUK-P0 version upgrade</strong><br>This upgrade enables clock synchronization of up to 176.4 kHz from the word-sync input. Even when no word-sync is used, the built-in high-precision crystal oscillator of 10 times or more (within 3 ppm) compared to the conventional one enables operation with a high-precision clock.<br>In addition, it is equipped with up-conversion (2 fs : 24 bit / 88.2 khz, 4 fs : 24 bit / 176.4 khz) digital outputs (2 XLRx, 1 RCAx, 1 BNCx). It can output 2Fs/4Fs digital outputs from the XLR jacks in compliance with dual AES specifications. The up-conversion circuit uses Diack&#39;s original RDOT algorithm.<br>In addition, the power supply section will be strengthened and parts such as electrolytic capacitors and diodes will be changed.<br>As a result of this upgrade, the ST link terminal is removed and becomes unusable.<br><br>* RDOT is a method born from the research of industry, government, and academia by Professor Tora-shi of Tsukuba University&#39;s Research Center for Advanced Chemistry and International Research. It is an analog-based interpolation technology that generates sound of frequencies of 20 kHz or more from CD format based on full entropy theory.</p>
