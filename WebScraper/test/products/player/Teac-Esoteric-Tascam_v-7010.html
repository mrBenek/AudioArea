				<p class="detail">This 3-head cassette deck appeared as the 2nd generation model of the V series.<br><br>The V-Series uses a center mount system, and the tape transport mechanism is located in the center, which is highly stable both structurally and visually. By eliminating uneven weight distribution, the occurrence of distortion of the chassis is greatly reduced.<br>In addition, we have constructed a mechanism that is less susceptible to external vibration because it is located away from the legs.<br><br>The head part is equipped with PCOCC winding cobalt amorphous recording / playback combination 3 heads.<br>By taking advantage of the amorphous non-crystalline structure and laminating it into 14 layers, eddy current loss is suppressed and high-frequency characteristics are also improved. In addition, in order to suppress slight distortion and transmission loss in the head handling minute signals, 99.997% PCCC (single-crystal high-purity oxygen-free copper), which is reputed as a high-efficiency transmission material, is used for the internal winding.<br>Zinc alloy die-cast is used for the head base to suppress the influence of vibration on the head part and reduce modulation noise. In addition, by accurately positioning the head, the azimuth angle, high-frequency characteristics, and phase characteristics are maintained with high precision over a long period of time.<br><br>Each section is driven reliably and efficiently by adopting a 3-motor system for the mechanism part.<br>In addition, a closed-loop dual capstan system has been adopted. Two pairs of capstan and pinch rollers on both sides of the head keep the tape tension constant and eliminate external influences such as microvibration to ensure excellent running performance. In addition, by using a frequency-distributed system in which the diameters of the pinch rollers on the left and right sides are slightly changed, periodic fluctuation of the tachometer is cancelled, and wow flutter is greatly reduced. In addition, capstan is subjected to a precise sub-micron order etching process to greatly increase the gripping force of the tape and prevent slight tape slip.<br>In addition, the capstan motor shaft is equipped with a high-precision large flywheel, which greatly increases inertial mass and realizes stable rotation.<br><br>The motor is equipped with a quartz PLL DD motor with crystal oscillation accuracy.<br><br>Equipped with an anti-static cassette stabilizer, the entire cassette half is strongly pressed and loaded to completely eliminate harmful microvibration.<br>The arm has a 2-layer structure made of 2 mm thick aluminum, and the cassette holder has a high rigidity made of 1.6 mm thick steel plate, making it a vibration-resistant structure that suppresses resonance and prevents deflection and deformation of the holder.<br>In addition, the cassette half is equipped with a highly conductive special pad that is always attached to the half to prevent dust around the head from being pulled by the charging of the cassette half and to prevent dropout and tape damage. This special pad allows static electricity to escape and prevents the half from being charged, thus reducing trouble.<br><br>In the cassette half, structural warpage occurs. In the general method, this is limited to 4 points, but there is a possibility that one of the points may float, causing vibration due to looseness.<br>The V -Series uses a triangle cassette support system, which eliminates rattling by securely supporting at the three most effective points.<br><br>Special vibration resistant material is used for the cassette lid, and reinforcement ribs are added to disperse and absorb micro vibrations.<br><br>The amplifier section uses two power supplies and a direct-coupling type all-stage monaural all-DC configuration amplifier to eliminate interference between the left and right channels.<br>The head amplifier section is also an FET differential input DC amplifier without the input coupling capacitor, which greatly improves low-frequency noise characteristics and improves frequency characteristics over the entire band.<br><br>By minimizing the amount of wire in the circuit section and by adopting the shortest path design, deterioration of sound quality and noise interference caused by wire routing are suppressed.<br>In particular, the recording volume and input terminal are directly connected and the input signal is designed to be sent directly to the line amplifier section.<br><br>A large power transformer is used for the power supply section, and interference is suppressed by making the mechanism system and the read / write amplifier system independent of the transformer winding.<br>The V-7010 uses a custom made electrolytic capacitor of 6,800 micro-F.<br><br>Each circuit section is separated by an internal chassis layout, and by completely shielding the input section, control section, amplifier section, display section and mechanism section, electrical and physical interference between each section is eliminated.<br>In addition to the chassis dedicated to the mechanism section, it has an independent side chassis and a center chassis connecting the front and rear parts. It is firmly assembled on top of the heavyweight bottom chassis that supports the entire bottom. Moreover, high rigidity is achieved by firmly integrating the front and rear panels and the inverted U-shaped top panel.<br>The top panel is firmly integrated with the chassis body by 5-screw mounting to eliminate resonance.<br><br>The V-7010 is equipped with a side panel made of core wood with high mass and large damping effect on the side, which greatly suppresses vibration of the body.<br>In addition, the chassis uses copper plated chassis.<br><br>Equipped with an independent calibration system for left and right channels.<br>When adjusting, the meter scale automatically changes and accurate adjustment is possible using the built-in oscillator.<br><br>Equipped with Dolby HX Pro, high frequency characteristics can be improved.<br><br>Equipped with Dolby B/C-NR as a noise reduction system.<br><br>Equipped with a double FL display with excellent visibility.<br>This display is equipped with functions such as digital peak margin display which accurately displays the instantaneous peak value in dB and linear time tape counter.<br><br>It is equipped with CPS automatic selection function of 15 songs in front and back.<br><br>Equipped with CD direct function.<br>In addition, it is equipped with a CD level check function that can easily tell the recording level of CDs.<br><br>The power cord is a large-capacity OFC material with polarity indication.<br>In addition, we have adopted parts such as recording volume with focus on the feeling of operation, gold-plated terminals with little deterioration, and custom-made capacitors for audio.<br><br>It is equipped with functions such as return to 0 function, auto monitor, auto tape selector, and auto rec mute for 4 seconds.<br><br>Power Load / Power Eject function enables smooth and reliable operation.<br><br>It supports the CD sync function and can be synchronized with a Teac CD player with a CD/DECK SYNC connector.<br><br>There are 2 color variations of gold and black.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.<br>The display can be turned on / off with this remote control.</p>
