				<p class="detail">A CD player developed by inheriting the concept of GT-CD1.<br><br>The GT-CD2 consists of a woodbase made of 60 mm thick particleboards using Yamaha woodworking technology and a drive mechanism housing made of cast gunmetal. The exterior of the GT-CD2 is made of American Walnut sound, with an open-pore finish.<br>The wood base is lined with 2.3 mm thick steel plates, and is directly connected to the GP legs, which consist of round steel machined pinpoint legs and removable leg-bases, by using four 22 mm hex iron poles opposite each other. Thus, even when the leg-base is used, the load is always supported by pinpoint and the height can be adjusted.<br>In the lower part of the wood base, a D/A converter is incorporated into a frame chassis made of 8 mm thick aluminum blocks.<br>High rigidity and non-resonance are realized by the rigid structure without floating and weight of 24 kg.<br><br>The player and DAC parts are completely separated in a separate structure. Furthermore, the separated player and DAC parts are placed in one housing in an &quot;integrated separate structure&quot;.<br>In addition, by placing the master clock in the DAC section and using a VCXO system for the clock in the player section, we have achieved the same level of jitter as an all-in-one player despite the separate structure.<br><br>The mechanism section uses a top-entry system with a disc player on the base of a 3 kg housing made by cutting out the entire cast gunmetal.<br>A brushless motor with a shaft diameter of 4 mm is adopted for the spindle motor, and rubber is attached to the brass machined disk table to ensure high accuracy and prevent slipping during acceleration and deceleration.<br><br>The pickup section uses a 3-beam system. Guided by two precision shafts, the timing belt feed mechanism gives priority to stability and quietness, and realizes smooth playback.<br><br>The clamp of the disk is gravity type, and it uses a round steel shaving clamper of 160g weight. In addition, high accuracy is ensured by using the shaft of the motor as it is in the center.<br>In addition, the entire player part is tilted two degrees toward the front of the housing to prevent the shaft from swinging and to stabilize the oil film of the bearing.<br><br>The D/A converter uses Yamaha&#39;s original I-PDM 1-bit DAC and secondary noise shaping.<br>Accurate D/A conversion is achieved by combining the I-PDM method, which achieves accurate analog conversion even if the digital waveform is not ideal, and the secondary noise shaping method, which ensures a high dynamic range while reducing out-of-band noise to a low level.<br>In addition, by using DACs with a processing capacity of 2 ch in one chip independently on the left and right sides, mutual interference can be prevented, positive and negative phase signals can be output, dither components are completely cancelled, and random noise is reduced by 3 dB.<br><br>The audio section is composed of discrete elements composed entirely of transistors. It has differential-input, complimentary service output-class A operation.<br>Audio parts used in GT-CD1 are used for parts.<br><br>In the power supply section, the servo / DAC and audio amplifier sections are separated from the transformer, and the servo and DAC sections are wound separately to reduce interference. In the filter condenser, the audio section is at least 27,000 μ F and the DAC section is at least 10,000 μ F.<br><br>Uses an aluminum cutting switch.<br><br>Equipped with 3-step display switching function.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
