				<p class="detail">A three head cassette deck equipped with a closed-loop dual capstan system.<br><br>A closed-loop dual capstan system is adopted for the tape transport mechanism.<br>This system consists of two sets of capstan and pinch rollers with the head at the center. The capstan is closed between the capstan and the tape can maintain a constant tension at all times, which greatly reduces modulation noise and ensures stable tape travel.<br><br>The capstan uses a digital servo DD motor.<br>In this motor, the FG pulse generated by the motor circuit and the reference clock generated by the quartz oscillation are directly compared digitally. By synchronizing with the reference clock, the motor rotation speed can be maintained with the same accuracy as the clock oscillation.<br>In addition, it is designed to obtain torque approximately three times that of conventional products, and it is possible to supply accurate tape speed with sufficient margin.<br><br>Zinc die-cast is adopted for the flywheel of the DD motor, and the dynamic balance is adjusted to 0.1g/cm or less per unit by high-precision processing, and torque ripple is suppressed.<br>In addition, by adopting an ultra-precision multipole magnetized FG magnet with a magnetization center offset of 10 μ m or less, the FG pulse itself generated from the magnetic material and coil is maintained with extremely high accuracy, and the speed and phase are thoroughly stabilized.<br><br>By using two different materials, zinc die-cast and aluminum die-cast, the frame for mounting the driving mechanism effectively suppresses sound pressure vibration from the outside.<br>In addition, the high rigidity TNRC base, which is also used in CD players, is adopted for the chassis, and high vibration resistance is obtained by thoroughly eliminating vibration.<br><br>The rigidity is increased by putting glass fiber in the cassette holder.<br><br>Power Assist Cassette Loading is adopted, and the cassette holder is firmly held in the fixed position of the mechanism by driving the cam with the exclusive motor. In addition, the half is held from above by the cassette half stabilizer, and vibration of the half itself caused by tape running is minimized.<br><br>Linear magnefield class AA is used for the recording amplifier.<br>This circuit consists of a voltage control amplifier and a current supply amplifier. The voltage control amplifier has an equalizer element in the feedback circuit to output a voltage with recording equalizer characteristics. The current supply amplifier converts this voltage output into a current and supplies the current at the head in proportion to the voltage.<br>As a result, both gain and phase of the signal magnetic field generated at the head remain as the output signal of the voltage control amplifier, and ideal recording is possible without being affected by the load.<br><br>Equipped with APRS to accurately set recording levels for digital sources with a high dynamic range.<br>When a signal is input in the recording pause state and the APRS button is turned ON, the maximum value of the input signal level after that is held and displayed on the meter. Then, simply move the Rec-Level knob, and the hold display on the meter will move accordingly and display the appropriate recording level.<br>This allows the digital source to be recorded with a margin of + 20 dB in addition to the recording amplifier.<br><br>The level meter can be displayed in 1 dB steps with the range selector switch.<br><br>An amorphous 3-head system is used for the head part.<br>A ferrite erasing head with a Sendust guard is used for the erasing head.<br><br>As a noise reduction system, Dolby B/C and dbx 3 nr are installed.<br>Also, in order to make the best use of Dolby NR, an adjusting oscillator is mounted.<br><br>Equipped with linear electronic counter, memory stop and memory repeat are also possible.<br><br>Equipped with a BS bias that drives the bias at a high oscillation frequency of 200 kHz or more, it thoroughly suppresses beat noise.<br><br>Equipped with CD direct line input terminal, SN ratio is improved by optimum gain setting for CD input.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
