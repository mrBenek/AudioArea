				<p class="detail">This is a real-time reverse deck that realizes 0.4 second click reverse using original technology.<br><br>Equipped with a real-time reverse function, it is possible to record continuously back and forth without reversing the cassette, and the time required for instantaneous reversal is 0.4 seconds.<br>This mechanism uses an IR (infrared ray) combination tape sensor unique to TEAC. This is structured so that the boundary between the recording tape and the reader tape is optically detected using infrared ray and inverted. By this, the sound cut when the tape is inverted is shortened so that it is hardly felt in the sense of hearing.<br>Since this sensor operates even when the B-plane is inverted to the A-plane, reciprocating recording and repeat playback are possible.<br><br>A ± 2 power supply all-DC configuration amplifier circuit is used for the amplifier section.<br><br>The head section is a 4-track head system. The first and second tracks are used for forward, and the third and fourth tracks are used for reverse. Compared to the system in which the head is slid or rotated, stable running is possible.<br><br>A hard permalloy head is used for the read / write head and a double-gap ferrite head is used for the erase head.<br><br>The travel mechanism consists of three completely independent motors : a high-precision DC servo motor for the capstan, a DC motor for the reel, and a DC motor for mechanical drive.<br>Combined with the symmetrical twin capstan system, it achieves excellent rotational accuracy and stable tape travel.<br><br>Equipped with Dolby B/C NR as a noise reduction system.<br><br>Multi-CPU control is adopted for the operation part.<br>Control and operation of the mechanism are performed by CPU with LSI (x2), and direct tape function is possible which operates soft and smooth from any mode.<br>It also has multi-counter, CPS, and multi-memory functions.<br><br>The display section is equipped with 4-digit LED electronic multi-counter.<br>This counter can display tape count, elapsed time (minutes and seconds), and CPS.<br>It also features a 2-color 12-dot LED peak program meter.<br><br>Equipped with an alarm set function.<br>The built-in electronic buzzer sounds when the time set for recording or playback (up to 99 minutes) is reached.<br><br>Equipped with a CPS (Computomatic Program System, one shot skip selection) function.<br>This function allows you to skip over other songs and select the song you want to listen to and play it back. For example, if you specify 3, CP3 will appear on the multi-counter, and the program will search for a blank space between songs and start playing from the beginning of 3 songs ahead or 3 songs ahead.<br>This function allows you to specify up to 15 songs for both A and B. You can also check the intro of songs by repeating CP1.<br><br>With the built-in block repeat memory function, you can repeatedly play the part you want to listen to.<br>The microcomputer memorizes the start memory and stop memory, and repeats playback and rewind between blocks. This function operates on both sides AB and AB.<br><br>Equipped with auto-rec mute function.<br><br>Equipped with an auto reverse selector.<br><br>Equipped with a timer standby mechanism.<br><br>It is equipped with 100 mm long stroke slide volume.<br><br>Equipped with MPX filter.<br><br>Equipped with a 3-stage tape selector.<br><br>Equipped with an output volume that controls the line output and headphone output.<br><br>Equipped with microphone input terminal.<br>Microphone is the priority design, and the line input is disconnected when the microphone is used.<br><br>The remote control unit was sold separately as an option.</p>
