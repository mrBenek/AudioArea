				<p class="detail">This is a high-grade stereo cassette deck developed by putting all the latest cassette recording technology into the core of Onkyo&#39;s original auto-accu-bias system.<br><br>It uses a closed-loop dual capstan system in which two sets of capstan and pinch rollers are placed on both sides of the head to run the tape.<br>In this system, since the large windows on both the left and right sides of the cassette half are used for drives, it was difficult to use a metal-compatible head with a strong hysteresis loop even in the case of two heads due to space considerations. However, we have solved this problem by developing an ultra-compact double-gap metal erasing head.<br><br>The S &amp; S Sendust Recording / recording / playback combination head designed for ideal distortion rate and frequency characteristics, with a wide gap for recording and a narrow gap for playback.<br>The core material uses Sendust with excellent magnetic properties and ferrite-like hardness to demonstrate the performance of metal tape.<br>In addition, we have adopted a double-gap ultra-small head that combines a newly developed material Dynaloy and ferrite for the erasing head, and by generating a strong magnetic field by the erasing current from the oscillation block, we have made the erasing function perfect.<br><br>We have adopted a 3-motor system with exclusive high-torque DC motors for capstan drive, reel drive, and head base drive.<br>The capstan drive motor uses a brushless FG servo DC motor that has received a top-class reputation for its quiet rotational performance and stable swing. Combined with the dual capstan system, this motor realizes excellent wow flutter.<br>In addition, we have improved driving performance and maneuverability through a full-logic silent mechanism that centrally controls the operation of the drive train with a computer.<br><br>Aiming for top quality during recording, we have developed and installed an auto-accurate bias system that best tunes the bias value for each tape to be used and obtains flat frequency characteristics.<br>When the start button is pressed in the recording pose, the mixed output of two oscillators with low frequency of 400 Hz and high frequency of 10 kHz is recorded while the bias value is continuously changed. The mixed output is then compared and searched between the low and high frequency levels while simultaneously playing it with three heads. The bias value is locked at the point where the levels match. At the same time, the tape is rewound to the start position and waits in the recording pose.<br>Bias tuning is usually completed in a short time of 5 seconds or less (maximum 15 seconds). Moreover, the best bias value is mechanically memorized when the Accu-bias control knob is operated after the auto-Accu-bias operation is completed and the Accu-bias indicator changes from green to red. Therefore, it is possible to take advantage of the auto-Accu-bias even in the case of unattended recording.<br><br>Equipped with a real-time counter that displays the remaining time and elapsed time of the tape directly in minutes and seconds by switching the switch.<br>A dual sensor system that detects the rotational speed not only from the delivery reel but also from the take-up reel and calculates the remaining time using a computer based on both rotational speeds. This system prevents in principle the effect of tape thickness depending on brand and grade and improves time detection accuracy.<br>In addition, since the remaining time is displayed within a few seconds from any position during a performance, it is also effective when recording is started with a tape in the middle of rewinding. In addition, the remaining time display continues during fast-forward and rewinding in the same way as when playing.<br>There are three types of remaining charge display switches, C-46/C-60/C-90. By simultaneously pressing any two of them, you can also use C-50 (46 and 60), C-80 (60 and 90), and C-120 (46 and 90) tapes.<br><br>Equipped with Dolby C NR, the noise reduction operation start frequency is lower than that of Dolby B, and high reduction effect in the frequency band where noise reduction is required is obtained.<br>In addition, by adopting a sliding band method in which the operation start frequency is changed according to the magnitude of the input level, the bleeding phenomenon (noise breathing phenomenon), which becomes more conspicuous as the noise improvement amount increases, is solved.<br>In addition, it has a built-in anti-sound saturation circuit that detects over-level in the high-frequency range and suppresses the high-frequency range of the large input signal for recording. By restoring it during playback, the high-frequency saturation level is substantially improved.<br><br>The built-in recording calibrator enables level correction even if the recording level is different from that of the reference tape.<br><br>The Auto-Space / Rec Mute function is equipped. When you press the Auto-Space switch during recording, an unrecorded portion is automatically created for approximately five seconds and waits for recording with Rec-Pause.<br><br>Equipped with digital level indicator using 2-color FL tube.<br>It is a wide range type of -20dB to + 8 db with 7-point peak hold (approx. 3 seconds) that can read the peak value at the moment.<br><br>Equipped with a timer standby mechanism.<br><br>0 : 00 position, memory stop and play after rewind is possible.</p>
