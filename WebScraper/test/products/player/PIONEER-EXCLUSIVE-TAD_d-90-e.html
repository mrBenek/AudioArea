				<p class="detail">In addition to the 4fs18bitA / D converter and 8fs20bitD / A converter, a dither circuit is installed on the DAT deck for high sound quality.<br><br>A 4fs18bitA/D converter for the recording side and an 8fs20bitD/A converter for the playback side were installed for the first time in the DAT for high-precision signal processing.<br>In addition, both the A/D and D/A converters are L/R-independent configuration, eliminating phase shift between channels and preventing distortion and noise.<br><br>It is equipped with an A/D side dither circuit developed by a unique method applying the dither technology used in professional digital sound recorders.<br>This circuit adds a dither signal outside the audible band to the analog input signal, performs A/D conversion, and then removes the dither signal with a digital filter to enable conversion with excellent linearity. It reproduces a more faithful signal by dispersing and averaging conversion errors caused by 0 cross distortion at a minute level.<br><br>For high-quality source recording, a line-straight switch is installed.<br>By turning the switch ON, the signal can be input to the A/D converter without passing through the input volume and the 5th low-pass filter. This minimizes the signal path and reduces phase distortion.<br><br>The audio circuit board uses twin monoconstruction for improved separation. The recording / reproducing and L/R circuit blocks are divided into four sections. The placement of parts and the length and routing of wires are symmetrical to eliminate interference between each circuit block.<br>In addition, the spacing between the input / output pin jacks is taken into consideration in the terminal layout to improve channel separation.<br><br>In order to achieve high sound quality, the printed circuit board for audio uses double-sided boards made of single-sided solid earth foils to provide shielding effect and greatly reduce noise. In addition, the ground line on the board uses bus bars made of 1 mm thick extra-thick oxygen-free copper plates to reduce the impedance of the ground and improve the rigidity and sound quality.<br>In addition, it is designed with high sound quality to every detail, and selected capacitors and resistors are used.<br><br>The head is equipped with a high-power AT head developed by integrating Pioneer&#39;s original advanced precision processing technology. This head features an AT (All Track) structure with 20 μ m uniform track processing in the track trace direction.<br>In addition, glass is welded on both sides in order to improve abrasion resistance, and special polishing is applied to the gap which is the entrance of the signal to realize more stable tape touch.<br>Furthermore, by increasing the playback output level by 2 dB to 6 dB, it is possible to read signals with high precision and low error rate.<br><br>The mechanism uses a highly rigid flat chassis made of 1.6 mm thick material.<br>In order to prevent the generation of strain due to bending process, this steel plate has been specially processed into a flat structure to reduce unnecessary vibration generated by the mechanism.<br><br>The mechanism and power transformer, which are sources of vibration, are fixed to an isolated chassis independent from the main chassis.<br>In addition, the isolated chassis is grounded with a dedicated zinc die-cast insulator and mechanically separated from the audio unit mounted on the main chassis to eliminate the adverse effects of unwanted vibrations.<br><br>In order to suppress vibration of the cassette half, Pioneer&#39;s original cassette stabilizer is mounted.<br>By sandwiching the cassette half with special rubber at the top and bottom and pressing it with resin at two places on the left and right, the cassette half is firmly fixed and the double anti-vibration structure realizes the stable running of the tape.<br><br>Large honeycomb insulators and copper-plated honeycomb chassis are used to prevent harmful external vibrations from being transmitted to the mechanism and each circuit.<br><br>The power transformer uses a large power transformer consisting of a bifilar OFC winding with separate windings for audio and digital circuits. The case is filled with epoxy resin to suppress vibration of the transformer body.<br><br>Equipped with 2-mode ON/OFF function of FL display which is a source of digital noise.<br>In half-OFF mode, if the display is turned off due to something other than playback or recording, segments other than the pole number display are turned off. In full-OFF mode, if the display is turned off during playback or recording, all segments are turned off.<br><br>By examining the material and shape of the gear belt, we have adopted a silent mechanism that reduces the operating noise when the tape is running or when the cassette is attached or removed.<br>The quick response mechanism also reduces the amount of time between tape insertion and sound.<br><br>Equipped with an intelligent peak monitor, you can easily record high quality by simply adjusting the recording level volume to -01dB.<br>The peak margin display shows the amount of dB remaining based on the maximum allowable level (full bit / 00 dB for digital signals), and displays the range from -50dB to 00 dB in 1 dB steps. The over-level display shows the level exceeding the maximum allowable level in 1 dB steps up to + 8 dB. The recording volume attenuation display shows the recording volume attenuation in 1 dB steps from 0 dB to 36 dB.<br><br>It is equipped with a TOC function that stores the program time and the length of each song in the first position of the tape.<br><br>With an AI search of approximately 300 times (at the fastest time), more comfortable operation is realized.<br>AI search by program number and AI search by TOC information are available.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
