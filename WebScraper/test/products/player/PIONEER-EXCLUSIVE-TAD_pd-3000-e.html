				<p class="detail">A reference model CD player developed under the technical concept of Real Transmission Design with the theme of &quot;expressive power of music&quot;.<br><br>It is equipped with an 18-bit 4 x oversampling digital filter. By calculating the sampling frequency and performing 4 x oversampling, unnecessary high-order noise is moved to the high-frequency range. It is removed with a low-order discrete analog low-pass filter with slow characteristics.<br>As a result, excellent phase characteristics and low distortion audio characteristics are obtained.<br><br>The D/A converter is equipped with a real 18-bit twin D/A converter. By increasing the quantization level from 16 bits to 18 bits, we have succeeded in reducing quantization noise to 1/4.<br><br>It is equipped with the Accu-Focus system, the pickup technology used in the Laser Vision Player LD-S1.<br>The photodetector is divided into four parts for focus servo control. The laser beam that hits the photodetector moves across the photodetector along the direction of the pit travel, causing a time lag between the leading signal and the trailing Yukinobu, resulting in a phase difference in the high-frequency range.<br>The AcFOCUS system delays the preceding signal and matches the phase with the following signal to obtain an RF signal with less reading errors.<br><br>Newly developed pickup is mounted on the pickup part.<br>By using a high-magnification (7.5 times) finite objective lens without the need for a collimator lens as in the past, we have achieved a stable optical path with a margin in the optical path length. In addition, by increasing the thickness of the half mirror as much as possible and designing the angle of incidence as large as possible, we minimize distortion caused by external forces, reduce harmful aberrations in the optical path, and improve the quality of the optical signal.<br>The latest IC technology is also applied to the photodetector, and the buffer amplifier is integrated in the same IC to realize a signal system that is stable against disturbances. In addition, analysis technology using a large computer is utilized to mold the pickup body with resin to reduce the use of adhesive, which reduces reliability.<br><br>The power supply section uses a twin power transformer that completely separates the servo / digital power supply and the audio power supply from the transformer itself. In addition, the OFC extra-thick 4-core power cord that separates the core wire from the base of the power plug reduces the subtle influence (wraparound) from the servo circuit and the digital circuit to the audio circuit. In addition, the audio transformer uses OFC bifilar winding and silica sand resin impregnation that suppresses vibration.<br>For audio circuits, we have adopted a discrete push-pull power supply circuit that uses high-precision components such as constant current diodes to stabilize the power supply and suppress fluctuations in the power supply voltage. In addition, we have adopted a remote sensing method that detects changes in the voltage at the load end, feeds back the voltage, and controls the voltage, greatly reducing the effect of pattern impedance from the power supply circuit to the load end.<br><br>The audio circuit uses a large circuit board of 140x300mm, on which parts are arranged in an appropriate pattern layout independently and symmetrically on the left and right sides.<br>In addition, a double-sided circuit board is used to enhance the shielding effect, and the structure is completely separated from the servo system circuit to eliminate mutual interference.<br><br>An A-class FET buffer amplifier is used in the analog circuit to realize stable waveform transmission that is not affected by load fluctuation of the power supply, mutual interference of each circuit, load of the pre-stage and post-stage amplifier.<br><br>The conventional digital signal circuit had separate clock circuits for the decoder, D/A converter, and system control microcomputer. However, in the PD 3000, the D/A converter, digital filter, decoder, and system control microcomputer are synchronized by the clock. This prevents the generation of beats due to interference of multiple clocks.<br><br>In order to protect the pickup from unnecessary vibration, non-resonance lamisert mechanical base is adopted.<br>The mechanical base supporting the pickup is made into a double structure, copper plating is applied to the base of the pickup side, and it is molded with special resin. This greatly improves the vibration damping characteristics, and at the same time eliminates the effect of magnetic strain.<br><br>In order to eliminate as much as possible the effects of unnecessary intermittent vibration and flux generated by the power transformer, an isolated transformer base is set outside the player.<br>Ultra thick aluminum angle and solid brass insulator are adopted, and the transformer block is floating structure.<br><br>The chassis has a honeycomb shape that greatly increases rigidity. The 1.2 mm thick steel plate provides excellent vibration damping characteristics. The entire chassis is plated with copper to achieve the same effect as two metals bonded together with copper plating, greatly reducing unnecessary vibration and magnetostriction.<br><br>Pioneer&#39;s vibration analysis technology vibration analysis technology, we have developed a disc stabilizer to improve sound quality by suppressing disc resonance. In particular, the PD-3000 uses a vertical clamp structure to further improve disc mounting accuracy, and a magnet catch system without mechanical contact between the disc stabilizer and the clamper that supports it to completely suppress unnecessary disc vibration.<br><br>In order to protect the optical system mechanism from external vibration, it is floated from the chassis. It uses a low center of gravity coaxial suspension made of special rubber and spring with excellent damping characteristics. It is fixed by ceramic support columns with high rigidity and high internal loss.<br><br>A large insulator with high vibration damping characteristics is used for the insulator, and the honeycomb shape is molded with resin to increase rigidity.<br><br>The analog output terminal uses independent gold plated pin jacks on the left and right to minimize contact resistance and provide mechanical strength as well as the effect of the gold-plated terminal that is resistant to aging.<br>We also use high-grade components for audio, such as resistors and capacitors, for repeated trial listening.<br><br>The pickup is driven by a linear motor system with excellent response speed.<br>In addition, the spindle motor is equipped with a high-torque brushless D. D. motor with three times the starting torque of conventional motors.<br><br>The tray section is made of special resin with high specific gravity to improve weight and accuracy. At the same time, the sliding section is made of metal bearing metal, combined with the wire drive system to realize smooth and quiet loading operation.<br><br>Built-in functions include a memory backup function that stores the program when the power was turned off last time, a time fade edit function that automatically fades out according to the tape time, a music window that automatically plays specified phrases in and out, a one touch fade function, variable fade time, and auto space.<br><br>Equipped with a changeover switch that stops the operation of unused circuits, it can cut off noise sources from unused circuits. In addition, the headphone circuit operates only when it is plugged into a jack. In addition, an FL off switch is also equipped to prevent scanning noise when the FL indicator is turned on.</p>
