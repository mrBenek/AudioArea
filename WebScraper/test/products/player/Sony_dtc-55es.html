				<p class="detail">The DAT deck is compatible with the serial copy management system to enable digital recording from CDs.<br><br>For the first time, Sony&#39;s DAT deck is compatible with the serial copy management system, enabling digital-to-digital recording from CD to DAT deck, which was impossible until now.<br>With the serial copy management system, it is possible to record digitally to digitally using a CD as a master, but it is not possible to record digitally to digitally using a recorded tape as a master. In the case of a tape recorded with an analog input, it is possible to record digitally to digitally using that tape as a master, but it is not possible to record digitally to digitally using the second generation.<br><br>The newly developed high-density linear A/D converter is used for the A/D converter.<br>In A/D conversion, the levels of an analog signal are sampled for each moment and each of them is quantized. However, if the original analog signal contains harmonics or other components, noise called folded noise is generated. Therefore, sampling is performed after passing a low-pass filter. This filter has relatively steep characteristics because of its relationship with the spectrum that appears centered on the sampling frequency. Therefore, group delay characteristics and phase characteristics were deteriorated.<br>Because the high-density linear A/D converter operates at extremely high speed, the unwanted spectrum that appears after sampling can be shifted far away. The low-pass filter is a first order CR type, an extremely light type.<br><br>The D/A converter uses an 18-bit linear D/A converter with an 8 fs digital filter in a dual L/R configuration.<br><br>Sony has developed and adopted a DAT head that can maintain a uniform gap width even when used for a long period of time by applying the head technology developed by Sony for VTRs.<br><br>You can record and play back 120 minutes continuously in standard and Option 1 mode and 240 minutes in Option 2 mode.<br><br>The Double-Encoded Reed-Solomon method is used as an error correction and correction method, which enables correction and correction even when a burst error occurs in the longitudinal direction of the tape or when one of the two heads becomes unplayable.<br>In addition to the Super Strategy, DTC-55ES employs a feed-forward Super Strategy method that takes error information in advance and makes optimal corrections, providing high reliability and vibration resistance that can withstand repeated high-speed searches.<br><br>It uses a newly developed second generation LSI that integrates signal processing LSIs for error correction, RAM control, digital I/O, etc. into only one LSI. This LSI boasts a high integration density of approximately 20000 gates in terms of the number of gates per LSI.<br>In addition, the microcomputer for controlling software servo and mechanism control is integrated into a single LSI, greatly reducing the number of parts and simplifying the board configuration.<br>This improves reliability and further improves error correction capability.<br><br>The newly developed vertical see-through cassette compartment allows direct confirmation of tape movement, as with cassette tapes, and also allows reading of label text. In addition, the time required to insert a tape and make a sound is reduced to half that of conventional models, enabling quick recording and playback.<br>In addition, a direct operation using a power loading mechanism is also adopted. Just by inserting the tape and directly pressing the desired button, the tape is pulled in and moves to the operation.<br><br>The mechanism is a 2D. D. + 1 BSL motor mechanism with a base unit made of high-precision aluminum alloy, dedicated direct drive motors for the capstan and the head drum rotation, respectively, and dedicated BSL motors for the reel are used so that the reel drive does not impose a burden on the rotational accuracy.<br>In addition, the motor servo employs a software servo that can set servo characteristics according to the mechanism and motor.<br><br>Equipped with digital fade-in / fade-out function.<br>The Fade In / Fade Out time can be set individually in a fine range of 0.2 to 15 seconds. In addition, since it is linked with the Pause function, it can be used for editing and recording.<br><br>It has a subcode function and can register start ID, skip ID and end ID.<br>Every manual start ID, skip ID and end ID is equipped with a rehearsal function. During the rehearsal, you can move the point back and forth in 0.3 second increments while listening to and confirming the sound. The movement time is displayed on the display. You can also modify the already written start ID while rehearsing.<br>In addition, it is equipped with functions such as an erase function that can erase the ID once written, a program number function, a renumber function that renumbers the number from the beginning of the tape with one touch, a shift number that renumbers the reattaching the start ID in 0.3 second increments, and a アブソリュー and time that display the absolute time from the tape top.<br><br>It is equipped with functions such as time search, AMS play, AMS search, program number search, music scan, repeat, end search and RMS play.<br><br>Equipped with optical and coaxial digital input / output terminals.<br>The optical input and coaxial input can be switched using a switch on the front panel. The optical input uses a servo-type digital signal normalizer circuit that absorbs cable jitter.<br><br>Equipped with a linear counter that can be switched to 4 modes : counter display to indicate tape running time, remaking display to indicate remaining time, program time to indicate elapsed time of music being played, and absolute time to indicate absolute time from the tape top.<br><br>During recording with digital input from a BS tuner or other DAT deck, the FOMA terminal waits at the recording pause for up to 10 minutes even if the signal is interrupted.<br><br>Equipped with a wide-range digital peak meter of -60 to 0 dB, each channel 22 segment.<br><br>The fs map function, which uses a digital peak meter, provides a visual indication of the approximate location on the tape at which sampling frequency is being recorded.<br><br>It is equipped with a digital peak margin display that digitally displays how much memory level is available in dB units during recording. The base data for this display is derived from digital processing circuit data as well as the data for the level meter display.<br><br>Equipped with a display OFF function, you can select from three modes : only the meter is off, only the meter is on during operation, automatic off during recording / playback, and all lights. This function can also be operated from the remote control.<br><br>It is equipped with a dimmer function that can change the display brightness by 3 levels.<br><br>It is equipped with a cue function with sound that starts at approximately 2.5 times speed while checking the sound, and automatically changes to approximately 8 times speed when you keep pressing the button.<br><br>By combining the timer sold separately, you can record your absence and play the alarm clock.<br><br>Equipped with an output variable headphone jack.<br><br>In addition to most of the operation of the main body, it comes with a wireless remote control which can be operated such as selection of music and pose of Sony remote control compatible CD player.<br>It is also possible to perform wireless CD-sync recording by moving the camera toward both the camera and the CD player to release the recording pause on the camera and start playing the CD.</p>
