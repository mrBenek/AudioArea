				<p class="detail">A stereo cassette deck that pursues pure and direct design and uses PCOCC for the wire material.<br><br>Three independent heads are used in the head section. The recording head is an SA head with high magnetic flux density and excellent magnetic saturation characteristics, and the reproducing head is an amorphous head with excellent high-frequency characteristics.<br>In addition, PCOCC (single-crystal high-purity oxygen-free copper) is used for the coil winding and signal cable, and OFC (oxygen-free copper material) patterns are used for the substrate to pursue the reproduction of clear sound.<br><br>The tape drive unit uses a closed-loop dual capstan system with direct drive by a high-precision motor. With capstan and pinch rollers on both sides of an independent head, the tension of the tape is kept constant from the beginning to the end of winding, ensuring constant head touch. Moreover, disturbance vibrations are hardly transmitted, and modulation noise is effectively reduced.<br>A 3-phase 6-coil Ceralock servo DD motor is used as the drive motor.<br><br>In order to prevent adverse effects on sound quality due to mutual interference of internal circuits, a 3-block independent structure is adopted in which the amplifier, control and power supply are separated.<br>In this structure, the microcomputer display is concentrated in one place, and each circuit board is separated by the delicate amplifier and inner chassis. In addition, the power supply is separated by the center chassis in order to eliminate magnetic retention from power transformers.<br><br>The power supply section employs a low-output impedance power supply with ± tracking control using a large transformer and a large capacitor. In this circuit, the positive and negative sides work together so that the ground potential becomes 0, thereby maintaining the stability of the amplifier.<br>We have also succeeded in reducing the output impedance to less than 1m Ω in the audio frequency band by combining a high-gain voltage comparison circuit and a constant-current control circuit with excellent high-frequency characteristics. In addition, the power supply is supplied to each circuit through a dedicated line to suppress current fluctuations, making it a highly stable power source resistant to complex changes in music signals, disturbance noise, and mutual interference.<br><br>The audio circuit has a DC amplifier configuration with capacitors removed from the circuit as much as possible for both recording and playback systems to improve phase characteristics, distortion factor, and linearity. Moreover, each circuit has an independent structure arranged on separate substrates to shut out interference between the amplifiers. Furthermore, the L/R-symmetric configuration eliminates interference between channels to improve separation.<br><br>In order to prevent unnecessary vibration, the inner chassis firmly reinforces the body from the inside. In addition, the lower part of the body is based on a high rigidity heavy solid base to pursue a low center of gravity and vibration control structure.<br>In addition, the large insulation foot eliminates disturbance vibration, and the under chassis is copper plated to reduce magnetic strain.<br><br>In order to input the music source at the shortest distance, it is equipped with a direct input terminal that can be directly connected to a CD player.<br><br>The front panel power switch, input selector, and input level volume are designed to be switched and controlled near the rear panel input terminal via the remote bar, and the transmission route of each circuit block is designed to be shortest.<br><br>Equipped with Dolby B/C NR as a noise reduction system.<br><br>Equipped with the Dolby HX-PRO system, the bias amount during recording can be adjusted according to changes in the music signal to obtain flat frequency characteristics. In addition, the high-frequency characteristics, which had been limited for cassette tapes, have been greatly improved.<br><br>It is equipped with a large FL display, which is equipped with a digital peak that can read the peak level numerically.<br>It also has a memory stop mechanism that automatically stops when the memory button is pressed and displays the remaining amount of tape.<br><br>Equipped with an auto monitor function, you can automatically switch and output the sound of the tape immediately after recording when recording, and the sound of the source when waiting in pause.<br><br>Equipped with an automatic music selection function.<br><br>Equipped with a bias adjustment function.<br><br>Equipped with timer start mechanism (recording / playback).<br><br>Equipped with a headphone port with volume.<br><br>Equipped with a synchronous recording terminal, it can record in sync with a Victor CD player.<br><br>Uses a thick power cord with polarity display and gold-plated input / output terminal.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.<br>In addition to basic operation, this remote control is equipped with a tape / source monitor switching function for recording and a digital peak call function.</p>
