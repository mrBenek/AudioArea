				<p class="detail">A CD player developed by inheriting the technical ideas of PD 3000.<br><br>The PD 8070 uses a core material that has more than three times the required capacity of 15 va for the transformer, and the power supply section is reinforced so that it can provide a stable power supply without affecting parts such as servo systems and audio systems.<br>In addition, the audio and D/A sections are equipped with bifilar twist transformers to increase the output voltage balance and reduce noise, vibration and stray capacitance. The core structure is also a large laminate wrap structure to reduce magnetostriction, vibration and leakage flux.<br>The audio circuit is equipped with a discrete push-pull power supply that has excellent transient response characteristics to load fluctuations.<br><br>The digital filter is equipped with a 4 x oversampling digital filter.<br>The digital signal sampled at a sampling frequency of 44.1 kHz is raised four times to 176.4 kHz and high-order sampling noise is moved out of the audible band. As a result, the analog filter of the next stage can be used with gentle characteristics, and audio characteristics with low distortion factor are obtained over the entire band.<br><br>The D/A converter uses a グリッジレス 16-bit twin D/A converter that performs D/A conversion by Dynamic Element Matching (DEM) method and eliminates glitch noise.<br>This simplifies the circuit structure for higher sound quality and improves channel separation and S/N ratio by making the left and right independent twin structure.<br><br>Similar to the PD 3000, it uses an Accu-Focus system that improves the accuracy of the RF circuit that converts laser light into electrical signals.<br><br>The pickup section is equipped with a newly developed pickup developed by analyzing polymer materials using a large computer and analyzing technology such as mounting simulation.<br>In addition to the highly reliable pick-up body, the photodetector unit integrates six small buffer amplifiers into one chip to realize a stable signal form against disturbance and enable accurate signal reading.<br><br>It adopts a floating structure in which the optical system mechanism is lifted from the chassis.<br>In addition, we have developed a ballast and base that reduce the occurrence of unstable lateral vibration by lowering the center of gravity of the mechanical chassis from the support part of the mechanism, and fix it on a ceramic mechanical support with excellent vibration damping characteristics.<br>As a result, the stability of the optical system mechanical part is increased, and the structure is resistant to both external and internal vibrations.<br><br>We have further improved our original disk stabilizer to prevent unnecessary vibration of the disk, and adopted a magnet clamp type that can fix the disk stabilizer and disk table with the attraction force of a magnet.<br>This new mechanism allows the disk to rotate without contact between the stabilizer and the clamper arm supporting the stabilizer. It greatly reduces vibration generated during disk rotation and effectively blocks the path through which unwanted vibration is transmitted to the pickup.<br><br>The chassis uses a honeycomb chassis with structural strength increased by honeycomb ribs, and in addition, by copper plating treatment, magnetic strain is greatly reduced.<br>In addition, since it is in the same state as when two metals are bonded by plating treatment, resonance points can be dispersed, and excellent vibration damping characteristics are obtained.<br><br>An insulator molded into a honeycomb shape is used for the insulator, which efficiently absorbs external efficiently absorbed.<br><br>It is equipped with a change-over switch that stops the operation of the circuit that is not being used. It is possible to completely stop the other circuit when using Digital Out or Analogout.<br>In addition, the headphone circuit is designed to operate only when it is plugged into the jack at the time of use, so that the factor of generating noise is eliminated as much as possible.<br><br>Equipped with functions convenient for tape editing such as auto program edit and time fade edit.<br>In addition, it is equipped with functions such as one touch fade function and music window.<br><br>It uses a digital level control that can adjust the volume of the disc with a remote control.<br><br>Equipped with a power on start function that enables timer start.</p>
