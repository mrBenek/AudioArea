				<p class="detail">ES series CD player with Advanced H. D. L. C. (high density linear converter system).<br><br>Advanced H. D. L. C is used for the D/A conversion method, and a newly developed score digital filter is used for the digital filter, and an advanced pulse D/A converter is used for the D/A converter.<br><br>The digital filter section is equipped with a score digital filter (CXD 2567) with a newly introduced dither method.<br>In addition to 45-bit oversampling technology, this circuit is Sony&#39;s first to add a pseudo-random signal to the signal before D/A conversion. This circuit decorrelates the requantization noise generated at the output of the digital filter with the audio signal, thereby further improving sound quality.<br>* SCORE is an abbreviation of Subliminal Correlation = decorrelation.<br><br>The D/A converter is equipped with an advanced pulse D/A converter (CXD-2562).<br>The Pulse D/A converter uses oversampling and noise shaping techniques to compress a 16-bit digital signal and outputs an audio signal with a current source and an electronic switch. This eliminates glitches, 0 cross distortion, and differential non-linear distortion that were unavoidable with conventional methods. The Advanced Pulse D/A converter is a further development of this. The Advanced Pulse D/A converter reduces requantization noise in the audible band and uses third order noise shaping to avoid a sudden increase in noise outside the audible band. The Advanced Pulse D/A converter is an IC with the introduction of Sony&#39;s proprietary high-precision arithmetic operation method that leads to a higher density pulse output.<br>In the advanced pulse D/A converter, two outputs of pulse length modulation (PLM) waves, which are complementary to each other, are differentially synthesized, and a complimentary service PLM consisting of single-channel 4D/A outputs is employed to achieve even higher precision and resolution.<br><br>It is equipped with a direct digital sink and the master clock is formed on the same chip as the pulse D/A converter. This allows the electronic switch of the pulse D/A converter to be turned on and off more accurately, eliminating harmful jitter and reducing sound quality degradation.<br><br>The analog low-pass filter employs a GIC-type low-pass filter in which passive elements such as capacitors do not enter in series. This filter reduces high-frequency noise without distorting the audio signal and outputs it to the line amplifier.<br>A DC servo amplifier is used for the line amplifier. By eliminating the coupling capacitor, coloring is suppressed and stable amplification up to ultra-low frequencies is possible. In addition, an FET suitable for small-signal amplification with a smooth start-up operation is operated in A-class operation at the output stage.<br><br>The servo circuit uses a high-precision digital servo.<br>In this circuit, the signal from the optical pickup is A/D converted, filtered and controlled by digital processing, and then D/A converted again to operate the optical pickup, making it possible to adjust the servo amount according to each disc.<br>The high-precision servo uses a high-sampling rate, high-precision, high-resolution A/D converter and D/A converter to realize a more ideal servocontrol and low power consumption by digitizing.<br><br>A fine drive circuit has been adopted, and the drive circuit of the optical pickup is composed of balanced push-pull with ± 2 power supply system capable of canceling the in-phase noise component, thereby reducing noise components from entering the earth line.<br><br>The mechanism uses a G-base unit reinforced by glass fiber with calcium carbonate added to a special resin to prevent loss of trace accuracy due to vibration and resonance.<br><br>The spindle motor for rotating the disk is equipped with a BSL motor that provides high precision and quiet rotational performance with little cogging. The spindle bearing is made of sapphire with high hardness and low friction coefficient, providing high durability.<br><br>An acoustic shield is used in the opening of the front panel where the tray is stored, a damper made of special rubber material is provided to improve airtightness, and the G-tray, which is the same as the G-base, is used for the disc tray.<br>In addition, it is equipped with a new stayable lock mechanism, and by fixing the tray with lock arms in four places (two on each side of the tray) during performance, pitching in the longitudinal direction and rolling in the lateral direction are suppressed.<br><br>The FB chassis is used for the chassis, and vibration is eliminated by firmly joining the whole chassis with a frame surrounding the outer circumference and beams passing through the front and rear front and rear, and the CDP-555ESJ has copper plating inside the chassis to reduce magnetostriction.<br><br>It employs a center mechanical mounting system in which the mechanical deck is located in the center of the chassis, minimizing the rotational moment applied to the chassis and improving the stability against vibration.<br><br>Uses fine ceramic insulators for the legs.<br><br>The board layout of the ES Series is also taken into consideration. The audio and digital circuit boards are separated in a separate sheet configuration. Furthermore, the digital circuit board is moved to the lower part of the mechanical deck to minimize noise from the digital part to the audio part.<br>The CDP 555 esj uses a glass-epoxy ES substrate for the audio circuit board.<br><br>The power supply section has a 2-transformer configuration. The digital servo section and audio section are fed independently, while the D/A converter section is equipped with a dedicated power supply circuit to eliminate interference from the power supply.<br>In addition, in terms of mechanism, rubber dampers are used at four locations to prevent transmission of the vibration of the transformer.<br><br>Aluminum front panel and side wood are adopted.<br><br></p>

            <p class="detail">The Custom Edit function is equipped with ten functions : peak search, time edit, just edit, link edit, edit navi, program edit, multi-disc program, time fade, variable fade, and manual fader.<br><br>In peak search, all songs are searched at high speed, and they are repeatedly played for about 4 seconds before and after the point where the volume level is highest.<br><br>Time Edit allows you to edit the A and B sides of the tape recording.<br>First, use the TIME SET button or the AMS button to set the length of the tape (you can also use the direct key to set the length in seconds). Then press the Edit button. First, program the music for side A in order, starting with the first track. When you encounter a time-over track, select the longest track that fits in time. Then press the Edit button to edit side B.<br>Also, if you select and edit a half disk with the AMS button, tracks are distributed so that the A side and B side of the tape are about the same length without changing the order of the songs.<br><br>Just Edit automatically finds and programs the combination of songs that is closest to the specified time.<br>Use the Time Set button or AMS button to enter the length of the tape, press the Edit button to select the length of the A side, press the Edit button again to select the length of the B side. You can also program the songs you want to keep in advance and just edit them with the remaining time.<br><br>Link Edit is used when a large number of tapes are left over during Time Edit or Just Edit. The track number of the song to be included in the remaining time and the LINK display blink, and you can add a song by selecting from the blinking track number again.<br>Link-edit also allows you to swap disks and continue the edit.<br><br>Edit Navi is a function that informs you of the operation procedure when editing a tape by Time Edit or Just Edit. The next procedure is displayed every 5 seconds after you start setting a song in each edit.<br><br>Program Edit allows you to manually edit your favorite songs in any order.<br>Use the AMS key or direct key to program your favorite songs in the desired order while checking the accumulated time. Press the pause button to program the A side and then the B side together.<br><br>Multi-disk programs allow editing across multiple disks, up to a maximum of six disks (24 songs).<br><br>Time Fade allows you to fade out at a specified time, which can be set with the TIME SET button or the AMS button.<br><br>You can set the fade-in / fade-out time for the variable fade from 2 seconds to 10 seconds in units of 1 second.<br><br>The manual fader allows you to fade in and fade out at the desired location.<br><br></p>
