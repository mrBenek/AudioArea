				<p class="detail">This is a CD player that uses a copper plated chassis as well as a non-resonant concept.<br><br>The entire chassis is copper plated to reduce magnetic strain.<br>In addition, because different metals are bonded together, the vibration damping is larger than when only a single metal is used.<br><br>Digital filters are used in the audio circuit.<br>A digital signal sampled at a sampling frequency of 44.1 kHz is pulled up to 88.2 kHz, which is apparently twice as high as that of the digital signal, and unwanted signals near 44.1 kHz are removed. This eliminates the need to use a low-pass filter with steep characteristics. As a result, audio characteristics are obtained with low distortion and little phase rotation up to the high frequency range of 20 kHz.<br><br>In order to suppress unnecessary vibration of the disk and obtain accurate signal reading, we have improved the conventional disk stabilizer and adopted special resin with good vibration damping characteristics.<br><br>We have adopted an in-house developed pickup.<br>By adopting an aspherical objective lens and a compound lens, transmission loss of laser power is reduced and heat generation of laser diode is suppressed.<br>In addition, a linear servo system has been adopted to further improve the basic characteristics of the pickup, eliminate unnecessary resonance and crosstalk of the actuator, and prevent sound skipping by appropriate servo characteristics and gain control.<br><br>Digital signal processing performed by multiple LSIs is synchronized by a single master clock.<br>This high-precision processing prevents jitter components from being included in digital signals and beats from being generated between signals, thereby reducing adverse effects on servo circuits and audio circuits.<br><br>We have adopted a pure transmission system in order to pursue higher purity transmission.<br>The digital part reduces unnecessary vibration of the disk due to the disk stabilizer and eliminates the adverse effect of external noise on the digital signal.<br>In the audio section, a low-noise low-output impedance regulator is placed close to the audio circuit on the PCB to supply each block circuit with reduced impedance rise.<br>In addition, the use of IC common to L and R is eliminated, and L and R symmetrical straight pattern is adopted.<br><br>The insulator is made of fine ceramic in order to block vibration from the outside.<br>In addition, the optical system is equipped with audio insulation that prevents external vibration by floating only the mechanical part inside the equipment.<br><br>Copper and Styrofoam capacitors are used for small capacitors, and oxygen-free copper (OFC) wires are used for wiring materials and plug cords for signal systems.<br>In addition, the lead-out portion of the carbon resistor is made of brass capped carbon to minimize distortion.<br><br>Equipped with an auto program edit function that automatically calculates and programs how many songs can be recorded within the length of the tape you use.<br>You can do this not only from the first song on the disc, but also from a specified song or later.<br><br>You can calculate and display the total playing time of the programmed music.<br><br>Equipped with a pause program function that is useful when you want to pause between songs for program playback.<br><br>If you put the CD in the tray, it starts automatically when the power is turned on.<br><br>Up to 24 songs of your choice can be played in the program.<br><br>Equipped with a headphone port with volume.</p>
