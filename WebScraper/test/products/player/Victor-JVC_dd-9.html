				<p class="detail">A 3-head cassette deck equipped with a quartz lock pulse servo DD motor.<br><br>The mechanism section is equipped with a pulse servo DD motor developed for cassette decks based on DD phono motor technology.<br>The basic shape of this motor is a 4-phase, 8-pole, flat-facing brushless, slotless, coreless, FG servo direct drive. The brushless structure developed by Victor Central R &amp; D Laboratories, in which the Hall element switches polarity, eliminates mechanical contacts, improves the rotational accuracy and extends the life of the motor. The brushless, coreless, and slotless structures eliminate noise and rotational irregularities such as cocking.<br>The pulse servo DD motor uses a frequency generator to detect the number of revolutions. Since it is an all-round integration type with 204 poles and 102 pulses, there is no detection error due to positional deviation. In addition, to prevent positional deviation from the beginning, the FG magnet is coaxial with the capstan and is magnetized while maintaining the center of the substrate. In addition, an auto-balance circuit is mounted to prevent torque fluctuation due to temperature rise.<br>The DD-9 is also equipped with a quartz lock, and the number of revolutions controlled by pulse servo is maintained at constant speed by quartz lock control.<br><br>The flywheels are made of compound materials that are effective against modulation noise, eliminating flutter components and high-frequency nigori caused by squeal (vibration).<br><br>An all-DC configuration amplifier is adopted.<br>Since the DC configuration amplifier can reduce the number of signal capacitors, the distortion, noise and phase change caused by the capacitor are reduced, and the transient characteristics are also improved. In particular, the head amplifier is a direct coupling using a double differential amplifier, and the microphone amplifier, recording amplifier and ANRS circuit are also DC configuration amplifiers with ± 2 power supplies. All the amplifiers that pass audio signals are DC configuration.<br><br>It uses a combination head that uses an X cutSA head for the playback head and an SA head for the recording head.<br>The 3-head system, which uses a recording head and a playback head, can provide the optimum gap width for each head, enabling higher fidelity recording and playback.<br>The SA head has a unique composite structure consisting of a Permalloy 6-layer laminate core and a Sen-alloy chip bonded at high temperature to the tape sliding surface. It has many advantages such as core loss, gap accuracy, wear resistance, and corrosion resistance. It also supports the superior high-frequency characteristics of metal tape due to its high maximum magnetic flux density.<br>In addition, the X-cutSA head improves the low-range waviness (contour effect) corresponding to the high-range stretch.<br><br>An SA (Sen Alloy) erase head is used for the erase head.<br><br>Equipped with B ・ E ・ Stuning system using microcomputer, recording bias, recording equalizer and recording sensitivity are automatically set for each tape, making it possible to perform just tuning for each tape.<br>In addition, the direction of the 3-head B, E, and S was examined when it was mounted on the DD-9 model, and it was redesigned to improve the accuracy while keeping the tuning time as it is, so that more balanced recording is possible.<br><br>Full logic control is adopted.<br><br>ANRS and SuperANRS are installed as noise reduction systems.<br><br>Equipped with a 2-color FL level meter that can switch between peak and VU.<br>This level meter is an 18-segment, 20-dot, one segment fluorescent display panel, and is specially designed to produce more than 0 VU in red.<br><br>Equipped with a newly developed 4-digit electronic counter.<br>This counter uses a Hall element to detect and count the magnetic change of the magnet connected to the take-up reel, and displays it in FL. It also has a 2-point memory mechanism and can be used in combination with an auto-rewind mechanism to repeat playback between any two points.<br>In addition, the electronic counter can also be used as a stopwatch by switching the switch and displays the tape running time so that you can check the remaining tape time.<br><br>The input volume is an electronic volume.<br>This electronic volume has been changed from the conventional round knob rotary type to a touch type with a motor drive.<br><br>Equipped with a timer standby mechanism and by connecting an optional timer, it is possible to record the absence and play the alarm clock.<br>It also has a timer safety lock to prevent accidental erasure.<br><br>Equipped with a rec mute mechanism.<br><br>Equipped with a memory rewind mechanism.<br><br>It has a playback volume linked to the headphone.<br><br>Equipped with a remote control terminal, it can be operated from a remote location by connecting an optional remote control.</p>
