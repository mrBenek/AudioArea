				<p class="detail">A cassette deck with some functions omitted from the high-end model GX-R75CX.<br><br>The click reverse mechanism uses an accurate reverse head system, a unique rotating head system of A &amp; D, which achieves smooth rotation and high accuracy.<br><br>LC-OFOFC twin field super GX head is adopted for the recording / reproducing head.<br>The Super GX Head is made of ferrite, which has excellent electromagnetic conversion characteristics and dynamic characteristics in the high-frequency band, and has been processed with high precision using our proprietary technology. Reduces loss in the high-frequency band and realizes wide frequency characteristics and low distortion rate. It also has excellent abrasion resistance, does not adhere to dust, and maintains excellent initial characteristics for a long period of time.<br>The Twinfield Super GX Head achieves the same recording and playback quality as a 3-head system by providing recording and playback gaps independently in the head housing based on the head with these features.<br>In addition, LC-OFC is used for the core winding, reducing the number of grain boundaries, which have a condenser effect, to approximately 1 / 7,500 compared to conventional tough pitch copper, and cuprous oxide (CU)<sub>2</sub>The rectification effect (semiconductor) by O) has also obtained the merit of night.<br><br>BSP (Bi-Directional Symmetrical Precision) mechanism is adopted for the mechanism part.<br>In the BSP mechanism, the tape transport is almost perfectly symmetrical to the left and right, and the reciprocating tape running characteristics are made uniform. In addition, the contact surface with the tape is made wide R surface, and the unique dual-wide tape guide that separates the left and right sides of the head is adopted, and the difference in the reciprocating tape running characteristics is suppressed.<br><br>The read / write amplifier is fully DC, and the circuit configuration greatly improves dynamic characteristics and resolution.<br>The playback equalizer amplifier, which has a significant effect on sound quality, employs a low-noise, dual-FET input operational amplifier to enable external phase compensation, and has the same high slew rate, low distortion rate and low noise characteristics as discrete components. Moreover, the playback equalizer amplifier is directly coupled to the head to prevent signal degradation.<br><br>Twin active power supply is used for the power supply section.<br>Since the twin active power supply maintains a stable power supply against current fluctuations in all bands, it realizes low-output impedance over a wide band and improves response to low-frequency signals that require large current.<br><br>Equipped with dbx noise reduction system to expand dynamic range.<br>In addition, Dolby B-CNR is also mounted, and high resolution is obtained by ± 2 power supply dedicated stabilization circuit.<br><br>In order to shut out high-frequency noise components generated by the microcomputer that operates the mechanism, it is equipped with an independent power supply and EMI (electromagnetic interference) filter to suppress interference to the signal system.<br><br>FBET (folded electrode transistor), LC-OFC winding, MPX filter with low-distortion core, and high tone resistance are used for audio.<br><br>The recording level can also be set manually.<br><br>Equipped with a direct lead-in and power eject mechanism, the tape can be loaded automatically by simply setting the cassette and pressing the desired operation button. In addition, the eject mechanism is motor driven, which is unique to A &amp; D.<br><br>An FL display is used for the display, and a 2-color 12-segment peak level meter is used for the bar meter.<br><br>The high rigidity design with a high-strength bottom plate and large foot suppresses harmful vibrations and resonance.<br><br>Equipped with IPLS (Automatic Cue System) that can cue the next song or the song being played.<br><br>Equipped with an auto-mute mechanism that creates a space between songs for approximately 4 seconds.<br><br>Equipped with an auto tape selector that automatically detects the type of tape.<br><br>Equipped with an MPX filter switch.<br><br>Equipped with an output volume.<br><br>Equipped with a timer start mechanism.<br><br>Equipped with a reverse selector.<br><br>Uses gold-plated terminal.<br><br>A cord with polarity indication is used for the power cable.<br><br>Remote control is possible by using the separately sold remote control unit.</p>
