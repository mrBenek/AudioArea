				<p class="detail">Twin recording re-reverse deck with Dolby S NR independently mounted on both A and B decks.<br><br>Equipped with Dolby S NR as a noise reduction system.<br>The Dolby S uses Dolby SR (Spectrum Recording) technology, which is used in movie film sound production. By performing precise signal processing, noise is reduced to approximately 1/16 (24 dB). In addition, the Dolby S is well aware of the breathing phenomenon unique to noise reduction. By finely controlling the pitch and pitch of sound, there is little variation in sound quality, and dynamic sound can be recorded naturally.<br>In addition, Sony&#39;s semiconductor technology makes it into a single chip, and high-density packaging technology makes it into a module with peripheral parts, resulting in high noise reduction and improved sound quality.<br><br>It is equipped with cassette stabilizers. As soon as the tape is loaded, the stabilizers installed inside the cassette door fix the cassette half and osae komi the vibration of the tape.<br><br>Laser-molded amorphous magnetic alloys with excellent magnetic properties are used for the head, and high-purity oxygen-free copper PC-OCC is used for the head winding, enabling recording and playback with less signal loss.<br><br>Equipped with the Dolby HX-PRO, the bias current, which is normally fixed, is controlled to an optimum value in units of one thousandth of a second according to the frequency and level of the signal, thereby maintaining linearity in the high frequency range.<br><br>By using a super-bias and shifting up the bias signal frequency, the difference with the audio signal frequency is expanded, which prevents beat noise and intermodulation distortion due to interference between signals.<br><br>Equipped with an auto-calibration function that automatically sets the recording condition to match the tape to be used.<br><br>Equipped with a sound auto-focus function that uses a microcomputer to control the recording level setting to detect the tape position and presence of Dolby NR and to automatically adjust the recording level volume according to the input signal level.<br><br>Equipped with a CD sync recording function, you can easily record from a CD by pairing it with a Sony remote-controlled CD player.<br>If you press the CD sync button on the remote control provided with the deck, the deck will start recording from the pause state and the CD will start playing a little later.<br><br>It is equipped with an electronic counter that adopts FL tube.<br>It uses a linear system that displays minutes and seconds linked to the time the tape actually ran. It also has a subtraction function that allows you to check the remaining time of the tape.<br><br>It is equipped with a peak level meter that can display the peak value of the audio signal in real time and also has a peak hold function.<br><br>You can switch the display mode between two modes : all ON / OFF.<br><br>Equipped with an auto-fader function, you can fade out / fade in by pressing the buttons while recording, and you can also fade in the recorded messages linked to the timer.<br><br>The A-deck is equipped with a pitch control function that allows you to fine-tune the tape speed within a range of ± 10% during tape playback or normal speed dubbing.<br><br>It is equipped with multi-AMS function which is further advanced from AMS function.<br>With this function, you can start up to 30 songs before and after the current tape position.<br><br>It is equipped with a blank skip function, and when there is an unrecorded portion of more than 10 seconds on the tape, it can be played by fast-forwarding to the next song.<br><br>It is equipped with an auto pause function. When dubbing at the standard speed, the A deck is placed in a playback pose for each song and the B deck is placed in a recording pose. You can edit the selected music.<br><br>Equipped with REC mute function with auto space, when recording or recording pause, the unrecorded part for approximately 4 seconds is automatically recorded to the tape with a single button, and it waits in the recording pause state.<br><br>It is equipped with a power loading function. When the operation button such as play / fast forward / rewind is pressed without closing the cassette door, the tape is loaded automatically.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
