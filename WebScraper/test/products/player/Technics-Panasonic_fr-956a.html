				<p class="detail">Stereo / monaural disc players designed for commercial use in broadcasting stations, halls, recording studios, etc.<br>It was exhibited as a reference at the 1979 audio show, and after that it was sold for business use.<br><br>The FR 956 a consists of a turntable deck with a turntable and a pickup, and a main body consisting of an audio circuit, a control unit, an operation panel, a lighting shelf, etc.<br><br>The turntable is directly driven by an ultra-low-speed brushless DC motor. Since there is no high-speed rotating part, machine noise is minimized. Also, since mechanical wear is extremely small, there is almost no degradation in characteristics and maintenance is easy. Since this drive motor is a DC motor with a large starting torque, start-up time is short.<br>A built-in frequency generator (FG) is used to detect the rotation of the motor to improve detection accuracy and stability. In addition, the rotation speed of the motor is locked based on a highly accurate signal from a quartz oscillator to ensure accurate record playing time.<br>DN860 is used for the reference signal generation part of the motor drive circuit, AN660 is used for the control part, and AN640 is used for the motor drive part to obtain excellent control characteristics and high reliability.<br><br>The tone arm is equipped with a gimbal suspension type bearing structure, an inside force canceller, and a dynamic damping mechanism for low-frequency resonance damping.<br>In the gimbal suspension system, the pivot point of the tone arm rotation is fixed at one point, and combined with the low friction of the in-house bearing, it realizes uniform movement in both horizontal and vertical directions.<br>The inside four scan cellar is not used in some commercial machines, but it is used in the FR 956 a to prevent the recording and needle tip from becoming unbalanced and to reduce distortion. The spring structure allows the inside force to be can be canceled according to the needle tip.<br>The dynamic damping mechanism prevents the reproduction signal from being modulated by the low-frequency resonance of the pickup system due to waviness of the sound groove, surface irregularities, warping, etc. of the record board. It controls harmful waviness by anti-resonance of the split weight.<br><br>Professional cartridges (for LP and SP) newly developed for SP) for the FR 956 a.<br><br>Double insulation system is adopted to suppress the vibration transmitted from the floor.<br>In the FR 956 a, vibration is damped by four insulators attached to the lower part of the main body, and is further damped by an insulator attached between the deck and the main body to achieve excellent vibration isolation characteristics.<br><br>Built-in phono equalizer for disc reproducer.<br>This equalizer can be switched between LP and SP, has tone control for tone correction, and has a built-in monitor amplifier and speaker so that you can start a song accurately and send it to the broadcast line.<br><br>By temporarily releasing the brake mechanism of the turntable, it is possible to rotate the turntable in the forward and reverse directions by hand, and accurate heading is possible.<br><br>Equipped with a main volume adjustment volume, it is possible to fade in and fade out the output signal.<br><br>CP (Conductive Plastic) is used for the attenuator to reduce sliding noise and realize a long life.<br><br>With built-in mixing circuit, 2 units can be connected and used.<br><br>Equipped with remote control function, play / stop control is possible from the outside.<br><br>Equipped with a large VU meter.<br><br>Equipped with a CUE lamp that is turned on by an external switch.</p>
