				<p class="detail">This is a cassette deck that uses the highly reliable mechanism originally developed by Denon and Dolby HX Pro.<br><br>The mechanism uses a highly reliable rotary encoder 2-motor + 1-motor computer-controlled silent mechanism. This mechanism uses a newly developed microcomputer for driving the mechanism that integrates the mechanical drive and counter display control into a single chip, and realizes smooth and silent operation.<br>The basic structure consists of a DC-servo motor for the capstan and a high-torque, low-ripple DC-motor for the reel motor. The capstan and high-precision zinc-die-cast flywheel have been specially treated to increase the friction coefficient. By reducing torque fluctuation (cocking) and running loss, the wow flutter and other basic features are enhanced.<br><br>The recording / reproducing head uses SF Hyperbolic Hard Permalloy R/P head.<br>This head reduces the contour effect at low frequencies by making the core part that touches the tape a hyperboloid shape.<br><br>The amplifier section uses a newly developed DC amplifier LSI for the cassette deck. This LSI consists of a left and right channel playback amplifier and a recording amplifier on a single chip. This LSI eliminates differences in L/R characteristics and sound quality, while reducing noise and power consumption.<br><br>The playback equalizer amplifier has a much higher open gain in the high-frequency band than the conventional operational amplifier and realizes low distortion over the entire frequency band. The amplifier also has a high S/N and a wide dynamic range by greatly reducing the noise level generated in the amplifier. In addition, the quality is enhanced by the DC configuration without the input coupling capacitor.<br><br>The C. C. D. C. (Constant Current Drive Circuit) is used in the recording amplifier section to eliminate output resistance, and there is no phase shift even in response to the impedance change of the head due to the recording frequency, realizing a wide dynamic range and low distortion factor.<br>In addition, direct coupling between the head and the recording amplifier eliminates sound quality degradation during recording.<br><br>The power supply is composed of ± 2 power supplies.<br><br>Equipped with Dolby HX Pro.<br>The Dolby HX Pro eliminates over-bias, which has been a problem with the conventional fixed bias method. When the input signal contains many high-frequency components during recording, the bias amount from the oscillator is automatically reduced. This greatly improves high-frequency characteristics and reduces distortion over the entire band. In addition, since the effective bias value is always constant even when the impedance of the head changes due to temperature changes or other factors, there is no degradation in high-frequency characteristics even during long-term recording.<br><br>Equipped with Dolby B Type and Dolby C Type as noise reduction system.<br>The Dolby circuit uses a newly developed symmetrical one chip LSI for left and right channels.<br><br>The Bias Fine control allows you to fine-tune the recording bias amount.<br><br>The display is equipped with a 4-digit digital counter with a memory stop function, a bar graph peak meter of + 8 dB to -20dB, and various indicators such as operation status, tape position and memory stop.<br><br>Equipped with a memory stop function.<br><br>Equipped with an auto tape selector, it automatically identifies each tape when it is set and automatically sets the bias / equalizer.<br><br>Equipped with an MPX filter switch, it can prevent Dolby NR malfunction by cutting the 19 kHz pilot signal included in FM radio waves.<br><br>It uses a Pause/Mute mechanism to combine the pause and mute functions.<br>In recording mode, press the Pause/Mute button (within 0.5 seconds) to create a recording pause. Press and hold the button for 1 second or longer to create a 5-second unrecorded portion and make a recording pause.<br><br>A one touch rec-pause mechanism is adopted, and recording standby can be performed only by pressing the Rec button.<br><br>Equipped with a balanced volume.<br><br>Equipped with a Timer Play-Rec mechanism. By connecting a timer sold separately, it is possible to record your absence or play an alarm.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
