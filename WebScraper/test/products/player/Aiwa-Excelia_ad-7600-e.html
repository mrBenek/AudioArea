				<p class="detail">A stereo cassette deck equipped with an original cassette autoloading system and a front control mechanism.<br><br>It uses a newly developed cassette auto-loading system, and the cassette is set automatically by the built-in dedicated motor. Since the tape is carried by the carrier, it can be set securely in the fixed position.<br>In addition, since the tape is set with an inclination angle of 30 °, the condition of the tape during driving can be clearly confirmed by the internal illumination lamp from both upper and lower sides.<br><br>The head uses an FG head that uses ultra-hard ferrite with excellent wear resistance for both the core part and the guard part. This prevents unbalanced head wear and gap edge collapse.<br><br>The mechanism uses a DC servo motor with a built-in generator to electronically detect changes in the generator output due to changes in the number of revolutions, and suppress uneven rotation due to fluctuations in voltage and load.<br>In addition, the inertia energy of the flywheel is as large as 1860g ・ cm, and the dynamic balance is accurately maintained. Therefore, in addition to pursuing the accuracy of other drive systems such as the center-driven reel shaft, an ideal condition similar to that of a horizontal mechanical system is realized.<br><br>Equipped with the Dolby System, which reduces tape hissing by simply pressing the switch during recording and playback.<br>In addition, in order to prevent malfunction of the Dolby system due to leakage of pilot signal during Dolby recording of FM stereo broadcast transmission, an MPX filter which cuts 19 kHz is built-in.<br>The AD 7600 is designed so that the MPX filter turns OFF when the Dolby is turned OFF, improving the frequency characteristics when the Dolby is turned OFF.<br><br>Equipped with a 3-step tape selector, you can adjust the bias equalizer for LH, Chrome, and Ferrichrome (FeCr) tapes.<br><br>Equipped with a large level meter up to + 6 dB.<br>In addition, it is equipped with a two step peak indicator that lights in two steps of + 3 dB and + 7 dB. For pulse signals that do not appear as a fluctuation of the hands of the VU meter, a yellow peak indicator at + 3 dB indicates the warning level, and a red peak indicator at + 7 dB indicates the distortion level.<br>Also, since it is a 2-step type, you can set the recording level as much as possible.<br><br>Memory counter and quick review / review / Cue are used for the cue mechanism.<br>By using both of them separately, heading operation can be performed easily.<br><br>The autostop uses a full autostop using a Hall IC that combines a Hall element and an IC.<br>Since it is a completely non-contact type, stable operation is obtained without aging.<br><br>It is equipped with a line input / microphone input changeover switch to improve the SN ratio at the line input, an oil dump type cassette lid open, tape running lamp, etc.<br><br>It has a built-in standby mechanism that starts the deck at the desired time by connecting a timer (sold separately), turning on the pause button of the deck and setting it to recording or regenerating condition.<br>Since the pinch roller is separated from the capstan while it is stopped, no excessive burden is placed on the mechanism.<br>In addition, if the power is turned off during recording and playback, the pinch roller is released and the mechanism returns to the stop state, so it can be used as a sleep mechanism of a timer.<br><br>There was a side wood as an option sold separately.</p>
