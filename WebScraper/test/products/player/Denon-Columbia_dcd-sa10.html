				<p class="detail">A SACD player developed by bringing together the best of pure audio technology.<br><br>The DCD-SA10 has completely separate and independent CD and SACD sections. Dedicated circuits are installed for the pickup, servo circuit, decode circuit, audio circuit, audio circuit, and output terminal. In addition, the audio circuit is a separate board unit to minimize interference between the CD and SACD sections, and the dedicated circuit configuration maximizes the advantages of each circuit.<br><br>The CD reproduction system is equipped with AL24 Processing Plus.<br>This circuit is a higher precision arithmetic processing of the conventional AL24 Processing without changing the algorithm, and by realizing more reliable arithmetic processing, the music playback capability is improved.<br>This enables high-bit expansion of data to 24 bits based on 16-bit CD data and high-sampling by 8 times over sampling to further reduce quantization distortion. In addition, pulse data can reproduce an impulse response without ringing by widening the pass band. In addition, an adaptive digital filter that automatically changes the cutoff band is inherited.<br><br>SACD playback is capable of outputting up to 5.1 channels for multi-channel playback.<br>The D/A converter is equipped with one of the highest specifications in the industry. Especially on the front channel, this D/A converter is used in monaural mode and each has its own differential output D/A converter, which is equivalent to the 4 dac configuration of a CD.<br>The rear, center, and LFE channels also use the same D/A converter used for the front channel to ensure high sound quality during multi-channel playback.<br>The peripheral circuit also uses high-quality sound components cultivated through the development of CD players.<br><br>The CD D/A converter uses a multi-bit 24-bit D/A converter, which realizes faithful conversion of 24-bit high-sampling data obtained with the AL24 Processing Plus.<br>The 24 bit multi-bit D/A converter is less susceptible to fluctuations in the power supply voltage (current), and the in-band quantization distortion level is constant regardless of frequency, enabling clear playback with less noise. In addition, a 4 dac configuration that uses two D/A converters per channel in differential operation, coupled with Λ S. L. C., which theoretically eliminates 0 cross distortion, realizes transparent sound playback even for very small signals.<br><br>The internal construction separates the circuit boards of the digital and analog sections, power supply, CD audio circuit, SACD audio circuit, display circuit, etc. to minimize interference and prevent sound quality degradation.<br>In addition to adopting a center mechanical mount with high structural stability, we also adopted structural technologies such as a mechanical cover that reduces the effect of vibration from the drive mechanism to the circuit, a large insulator made of sintered alloy with vibration absorbing material attached, a 15 mm thick front panel, a triple structure bottom cover and a double structure top cover. While clarifying the mechanical earth, we have adopted a vibration isolation structure that completely eliminates the deterioration of sound caused by vibration from inside and outside.<br>In addition, it uses a shield structure that covers digital circuits with copper-plated steel sheets to reduce the influence of electromagnetic waves on sound.<br><br>The case for storing the power transformer and the base for mounting them are made of aluminum sand castings that have large internal loss and do not transmit vibration easily. This reduces the effect of vibration from the transformer part, which is the source of vibration, on sound quality.<br>In addition, separate transformers are mounted for the digital and analog circuits, and the effect on other circuits is minimized by arranging the transformers symmetrically so as to cancel the ーケージフラックス between them.<br><br>Hybrid structure S. V. H. loader is adopted.<br>We have returned to the starting point that trays are unnecessary during playback. We have adopted a highly vibration-resistant paint containing protein for the trays themselves. In addition, we have minimized the impact of the trays on sound quality during playback by using lightweight and highly rigid aluminum die-cast shaft bearings with excellent vibration resistance and plates attached to the lower part of the trays to prevent subtle changes in the trays.<br><br>Newly developed mechanism is adopted for the mechanism part, and it is compatible with SACD trace.<br><br>The simple structure eliminates factors that degrade sound quality, such as eliminating the headphone circuit that loads the output section.<br>In addition, carefully selected high-quality parts are used for 1.1 parts.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
