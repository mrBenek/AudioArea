				<p class="detail">150 mm wide compact MD deck with MD-PC link kit.<br><br>By connecting to a PC using the included MD-PC Link Kit, you can perform basic operations such as MD playback / stop, Start Song (AMS), and fast forward / backward using the PC keyboard and mouse.<br>In addition, editing functions such as MOVE and ERASE can be operated on the PC screen.<br><br>By using the included operation software &quot;MD Editor2&quot;, you can enter Kanji / Hiragana characters from the PC keyboard (only English and Katakana characters are displayed on the PC), and you can print the entered disc name and song name on a label with a PC printer.<br><br>It comes with a PictureGear label maker that can create original MD labels, and can be printed directly on commercially available labels.<br><br>By connecting a PC with a line-out terminal to the MDS-PC2 using the MD-PC Link Kit, you can record a CD from a PC CD-ROM drive to an MD.<br><br>By connecting to a CD player compatible with MD Editor2 equipped with a Sony Control A1/A1II connector, basic CD operations and CD-to-MD recording programs can be performed on a PC.<br><br>Wide Bit Stream Technology has been introduced to enable recording and playback with a wide dynamic range by increasing the dynamic range of the ATRAC DSP and the audio data word length of peripheral circuits such as digital in / out from the previous 16 bits to more bits.<br><br>The 4.5 generation ATRAC DSP employs a new adaptive high-frequency control technology to improve high-frequency reproducibility and natural sound spread. For example, in response to an input signal, if the quantization bit number of quantization bits is small, the high-frequency range is limited and the number of quantization bits is increased for signals that feel distortion is worse. In response to signals containing complex frequency components that are less affected by insufficient quantization bits, the reproduction band is extended to higher frequencies to improve high-frequency reproducibility.<br>This adaptive high-frequency control technology combined with the expansion of the operation word length in the wide bit stream has improved the precision of signal processing, and the total harmonic distortion rate has been improved by approximately 8 dB compared to conventional methods.<br><br>It is equipped with a sampling rate converter that automatically converts 32 kHz and 48 kHz sampling frequency to 44.1 kHz.<br><br>The power supply section uses an R-core transformer with no gaps in the core of the transformer and a circular doughnut type in cross section to greatly reduce magnetic flux leakage and vibration.<br><br>Equipped with digital REC level control, the gain can be controlled from - ∞ dB to + 12 dB at the center of gain 0 dB.<br><br>It is equipped with a music sync function. Simply by pressing the music sync button on the remote control and then starting performance on the connected device, it senses the input of a music signal and automatically starts recording.<br><br>It is equipped with a time machine recording function, and if you press the multi-jog dial in the recording pause state, you can record up to 6 seconds before the sound on the disc.<br><br>It is equipped with a monaural recording and playback function that allows you to use the MD twice as long as the display.<br><br>You can DIVIDE, COMBINE, and MOVE songs, and it also has an UNDO function to cancel the last edit operation if you make a mistake.<br><br>It is equipped with a rehearse function that allows you to check edit points in COORDINATE or DIVIDE.<br>To move edit points, you can fine-tune the DIVIDE edit point in minutes, seconds, or frames (approximately 0.01 seconds).<br><br>Equipped with an A-B ERASE function that allows you to erase between two specified points in a song.<br><br>It is equipped with a title function that can record up to 1,700 characters of disc names and song titles on the disc.<br>In addition to alphabets, numbers and symbols, katakana characters are also supported. You can input characters from the FOMA phone or remote controller during recording or playback.<br><br>The SCMS (Serial Copy Management System) allows digital recording only for one generation and does not allow digital recording for the second or later generations. However, some programs from CS broadcasting cannot be recorded.<br><br>It is equipped with a smart space function that automatically adjusts the non-recording portion of digital recording to approximately 3 seconds.<br><br>It is an energy-saving design that realizes a standby power of 1W or less.</p>
