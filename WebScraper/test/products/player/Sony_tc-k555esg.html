				<p class="detail">A cassette deck developed as a new reference deck exceeding TC-K555ESR.<br><br>By installing a new mechanism, unpleasant mechanical sounds are suppressed and quick operation is realized.<br><br>It uses a closed-loop dual capstan system, in which the tape is held between two capstan sets centered on the head and pinch rollers, and tape travel is stabilized. This has many advantages such as improved wow and flutter characteristics, reduced modulation noise, and stable head touch.<br>In addition, the capstan drive employs a direct drive with a 3-layer linear torque BSL motor with less rotational unevenness. In addition, superior characteristics are obtained by a quartz lock servo and a zinc die-cast base that eliminates transmission of unwanted vibrations.<br><br>It uses power loading. If you put the tape in the cassette lid and press the operation button such as play or rewind without closing the door, the tape will be loaded automatically and enter the operation mode.<br><br>It is equipped with a cassette stabilizer. When the tape is set by power loading, the holding arm secures the cassette half and suppresses harmful vibration while the tape is running.<br><br>Using a 3-head system, the optimum head gap width for recording and playback can be set, resulting in better linearity and frequency characteristics than the 2-head system.<br>A simultaneous recording monitor is also available to monitor recording conditions in real time.<br><br>It uses a midship drive system. The mechanical deck and power supply are placed in the center, and the control system and audio circuit are separately placed on both left and right sides. This realizes a good weight balance in which almost equal weight is applied to the four legs.<br>In addition, it uses an inner chassis that divides the inside into three equal parts, which increases total rigidity and reduces electromagnetic interference between blocks.<br>In addition, the chassis is copper-tight (copper-plated) to prevent magnetic distortion.<br><br>Equipped with a bias calibration function, the bias value can be finely adjusted within ± 20% according to the tape to be used by the built-in oscillator while observing the indicated value of the meter.<br>It is also equipped with a recording calibration function that eliminates differences in recording and playback levels due to tape sensitivity.<br><br>The recording amplifier and the playback amplifier are integrated on an independent board and arranged in upper and lower two stages to reduce mutual interference. The all-stage L/R twin mono DC amplifier configuration also reduces interference between channels.<br>In addition, a GIC type bias filter is used in the reproduction amplifier section.<br><br>In order to realize pure signal transmission, single crystal ESC-OCC wire with high purity oxygen-free copper of 99.997% or more and with almost no grain boundary is used for head lead.<br><br>A large fine ceramic insulator is used for the insulator.<br>In addition, the power transformer is impregnated with a special resin and enclosed in a high-rigidity case prevent vibration.<br><br>Equipped with a CD direct IN terminal, there are two input lines together with the normal line input.<br><br>The head uses an LC-OFC wound laser amorphous head that takes advantage of the magnetic properties of amorphous magnetic alloys and employs an LC-OFC (linear crystalline oxygen-free copper) in the head winding of the original laser amorphous head. This reduces distortion due to capacitive reactances and reduces loss in the mid-range and high-range.<br><br>Equipped with the Dolby HX-PRO, the effective bias amount is controlled to the optimum value in 1/1000 second increments to prevent over-bias in the high-frequency range and improve linearity in the high-frequency range. This function works only during recording, so it is effective even when played on a deck without the Dolby HX-PRO.<br><br>Super-bias is adopted, and by shifting up the bias frequency greatly, the frequency difference with the music signal is expanded, and beat noise and intermodulation distortion due to interference between the bias frequency and the music signal are suppressed.<br><br>Equipped with Dolby NR B-C type.<br><br>Vibration control material with large internal loss is adhered to the chassis, and further vibration control material is inserted in the joint part of each chassis to suppress unnecessary vibration of the case.<br><br>The power cord with polarity is a cabtire cable made of OFC wire.<br><br>Uses gold-plated input / output terminals with low contact resistance and little change over time such as rust and corrosion.<br><br>By using the included wireless remote control, you can record in sync without connecting a sync cord to a CD player supported by Sony&#39;s remote control.<br><br>Equipped with FL tube adoption linear electronic counter with subtraction function of minute and second display.<br><br>It is equipped with a wide range peak program meter that displays real-time peak values in the range of -40dB to + 8 dB and also has a peak hold function.<br><br>Equipped with a display ON/OFF switch, three modes can be selected : all lights, counter only, and all lights.<br><br>It is equipped with an automatic music sensor (AMS) function that can quickly find the beginning of the previous or next music. In particular, the ESG series has been improved in usability by one touch operation.<br><br>Equipped with an auto tape selector that automatically detects whether the tape being used is type I (normal), II (high position), or IV (metal).<br><br>Equipped with an autoplay function that automatically starts playing after rewinding, and a memory play function that starts playing from the position reset to counter 0.<br><br>Timer recording and alarm clock playback are possible by combining the separately sold timer.<br><br>Equipped with a Rec Mute function with auto-space that automatically mutes for approximately 4 seconds.</p>
