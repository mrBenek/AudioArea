				<p class="detail">This DAT deck was developed by combining the know-how of LAX and the latest digital technology.<br><br>Two digital input / output terminals, coaxial and optical, are mounted.<br>A NEW pulse transformer is used for the coaxial output terminal of the KD-117 to improve the delivery efficiency.<br><br>3-mode sampling frequency is supported.<br>A sampling frequency of 48 kHz is set as the standard recording / playback mode of DAT and allows recording from line input, digital recording, and playback of tapes recorded in 48 kHz sampling mode.<br>A sampling frequency of 44.1 kHz is a playback-only mode, and a sampling frequency of 32 kHz can play digital recordings such as BS broadcast A mode and tapes recorded in 32 kHz sampling mode.<br>The sampling frequency of the tape during recording and playback is displayed on the sampling mode display.<br><br>The mechanism uses a recording and re-recording system with a rotating drum head (R-DAT).<br>In this method, the tape comes into contact with the head rotating at a high speed of 2000 rpm. Although the tape speed is as low as 8.15mm/sec, the relative speed is as high as approximately 3m/sec. In addition, the head is laid out obliquely with respect to the tape travel direction. The helical scan method is adopted, which enables high-density recording by using the tape space efficiently.<br>In the KD-117, the drive system such as the rotary head is controlled by a digital servo system with a computer in order to realize accurate reading. In addition, by developing and adopting a unique travel system mechanism, stability and responsiveness are dramatically improved, and a trace without distortion is realized. This has succeeded in smooth tape travel and significant reduction of drop-out.<br><br>The power supply section is a digital-analog separate power supply to prevent the high-frequency pulses from the digital circuit from entering the power supply line and ground line.<br>In the KD-117, the power transformer is separated by five secondary windings to eliminate power fluctuations caused by mutual interference of each circuit. On the other hand, a group of high-capacity capacitors with a total capacity of 92,000 μ F is used to realize a pure power supply.<br>In addition, an S. T. A. R circuit is used in the analog circuit from the power supply circuit to the signal circuit, eliminating sharing of the power supply line and ground line, and realizing smooth signal flow without mutual interference.<br><br>Audio parts are used everywhere to improve sound quality.<br><br>Dual D/A converters are used in the D/A converter section.<br>The KD-117 uses a 16-bit 4 x over-sampling digital filter, while the D/A converter uses a ladder network type and L/R-independent dual configuration to provide excellent phase characteristics during playback and sound with a good sense of location.<br><br>A GIC type 7th-order analog filter is used for the low-pass filter to effectively cut out harmonic components.<br><br>A low-pass filter defeat circuit is installed in the through input of CD.<br>The CD analog output has already passed the low-pass filter. By eliminating the low-pass filter on the DAT side, the quality of CD dubbing is improved.<br><br>By using subcodes, various tape playback is possible.<br>The Start ID and Skip ID can be used with the KD-117. In addition, a new mechanism that allows the start ID contained in the master tape to be copied as it is during digital dubbing has been adopted to improve usability.<br><br>Equipped with 3-speed fast forward function up to 150 times speed.<br><br>24-track program setting is available.<br><br>Equipped with REC END search, which automatically detects unrecorded parts.<br><br>It is equipped with a timer rerecording function that can be used for playing an alarm clock or recording messages.<br><br>Equipped with a function to display the remaining amount of tape.<br><br>Slide tray system is used for the tape insertion part.<br><br>Gold-plated input / output terminals are mounted.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.<br>This remote control can control two KD 117 s with one unit, improving the operability of dubbing etc.<br><br>If the copy prohibited code is recorded in the digital source, digital copying is not possible.<br>Digital direct dubbing from CDs is not available.<br><br>There was a side wood sold separately.</p>
