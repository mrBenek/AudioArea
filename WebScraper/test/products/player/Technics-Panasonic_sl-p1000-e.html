				<p class="detail">ClassAA This CD player inherits the SL-P1200&#39;s audio circuit, vibration-proof design, and editing functions, and introduces new know-how such as an active servo power supply for enhanced bass sound and a digital output terminal.<br><br>The classAA method is used for each of the L/R of three circuits (sample-and-hold circuit, buffer amplifier, and headphone amplifier) at a total of six locations.<br>High resolution is achieved by powerful drive capability and accurate waveform transmission capability.<br>In the sample-and-hold circuit for eliminating switching noise generated by the D/A converter, the voltage-controlled amplifier for waveform transmission and the current-drive amplifier for load drive such as the holding capacitor and low-pass filter are independent, and the voltage-controlled amplifier is operated in unloaded condition to improve the accuracy of D/A conversion.<br><br>The D/A converter uses a dual converter system with dedicated converters for Lch and Rch respectively.<br>This solves the problem of L/R phase difference, and operates the converter output in current mode to speed up D/A conversion and improve the distortion factor and resolution in the high frequency range.<br><br>To prevent noise generated in digital circuits and servo circuits from entering audio and audio circuits via the power supply, we have adopted a 2-transformer power supply transformer with dedicated digital and audio transformers.<br>In addition, the secondary winding of the audio transformer is separated into the Lcn, Rch and Route 3 of the headphone amplifier to prevent interference within the audio circuit.<br>A fast recovery diode and a high-capacity audio electrolytic capacitor are used in the rectifying circuit to reduce rectifying noise and to provide a stable power supply even when Dainyu is in power.<br>On the audio circuit side, the circuit board is placed inside a shield structure inside the chassis to eliminate interference from other circuit systems and power transformers. The line-out terminal is also equipped with a pin jack of shield structure and a coaxial cable with a high shielding effect to enhance sound purity.<br><br>A unique low-noise active servo power supply is used for the power supply for the audio circuit in order to cope with the low sound with a quick rise.<br>A feedback circuit is formed by combining a constant-voltage IC dedicated to the power supply with excellent temperature stability and a wide-band IC with excellent high-frequency characteristics. The feedback circuit reduces power supply noise by more than 20 dB, improves the S/N ratio, and provides excellent regulation (voltage stability) exceeding that of car batteries.<br><br>In order to eliminate various types of vibration that adversely affect sound quality, thorough measures are taken to prevent resonance and vibration.<br>First of all, to prevent sound pressure and vibration transmitted from the speakers, we have adopted a 3-layer weight base for the base, which is made of different materials such as metal chassis, special damping rubber, and new material TNRC (Technics Non-Resonance Compound). By converting vibration energy into thermal energy, high damping effect is obtained.<br>Special デッドニングゴム is also used for the top plate of the cabinet to improve vibration resistance.<br>Next, the floor vibration transmitted from the installation platform is suppressed by a double insulator structure consisting of four large insulators and a floating optical deck.<br>In addition, the two power transformer, which is the source of vibration inside the CD player, is provided with rubber floating to prevent the vibration of the transformer from being transmitted to the outside.<br><br>In order to eliminate noise components generated during D/A conversion of music signals, we have adopted a unique super-clean digital filter for audio circuits.<br>Sound quality is improved by combining a 96th order digital filter and an analog low-pass filter with high calculation accuracy.<br><br>Equipped with two digital outputs coaxial with the optical system, audio signals can be directly transmitted to an external D/A converter unit.<br><br>We use copper foil Styrofoam capacitors and audio electrolytic capacitors. We also use audio resistors with OFC lead wires and non-magnetic caps. Each part of the audio circuit is carefully selected after considering both physical characteristics and listening tests.<br><br>The pickup that reads disc signals uses a unique single-beam system with high laser efficiency and a greatly improved S / N ratio of reproduced signals.<br>In addition, high playability and durability are obtained by the use of an aluminum die-cast base, a glass lens resistant to changes in temperature and humidity, and a phase-difference tracking servo system.<br><br>Equipped with a 2-speed search dial that can finely cue the head in both forward and reverse directions by turning the dial with the fingertips.<br>The playback speed per rotation can be selected from two modes : approximately 1 second (slow) and approximately 30 seconds (fast), enabling precise access in units of three frames (1/25 second) at a minimum.<br><br>A linear motor is used in the drive part of the traverse mechanism that moves the pickup. The pickup movement between songs is reduced to approximately 0.9 seconds by a unique servo system using a microcomputer.<br>In addition, quietness and durability are improved by eliminating the reduction mechanism such as the gear belt.<br><br>It is equipped with a programmable music scan that sequentially plays only the intro part of songs recorded on the disc.<br>The playback time per song can be set freely from 1 to 99 seconds.<br><br>Equipped with a 10-key wireless remote control that allows you to perform almost everything from basic play and pose operations to search, repeat, and time mode display at hand.<br>It is also equipped with a digital Attenuator function that allows you to adjust the volume with the level key.<br><br>Equipped with a preset editing function that enables CD editing according to the tape recording time.</p>
