				<p class="detail">A full auto player with improved sound quality and operability by introducing the latest technology.<br><br>It has a built-in computer and realizes accurate auto operation such as normal full auto operation, search drive, queue down / lift up, memory repeat operation, etc.<br>Accurate operation is achieved by a fully non-side-pressure auto-return detection mechanism using CPU commands and photoelectric sensing elements, and by a pulse motor dedicated to arm drive.<br><br>The newly developed straight tone arm is used for the tone arm.<br>This arm has a linear structure that connects the rotating shaft with the needle tip at the shortest distance. It is a slim type made of hard aluminum material, yet it retains high rigidity. In addition, an ADC-type shell made of carbon fiber is used to minimize contact failure and resistance. In addition, in order to realize smooth movement of the tone arm, ultra-precision miniature bearings are used in the bearing section, and an extremely light feather support system is used in both vertical direction and horizontal rotation direction.<br>As a result, the effective equivalent mass of the tone arm has been reduced to approximately 15g (1/2 compared to the conventional one), and the initial motion sensitivity is as high as 0.5 mg at the center value, greatly improving the traceability.<br>In addition, when a high-compliance cartridge is mounted on an ordinary arm whose resonance frequency determined by the effective equivalent mass of the arm and the compliance of the cartridge is set to 6-7Hz, the infrasound component caused by the sleigh of the record is superimposed on the music signal and causes intermodulation. To prevent this, the resonance frequency is set to a value that suppresses the effect of the sleigh.<br><br>The cartridge is equipped as standard with a VM type 0.6 mil circular needle OC-201V with a dual magnet structure similar to the recording cutter head.<br><br>Uses a 20-pole, 30-slot vertical direct drive motor.<br>Since the servo circuit instantaneously compensates for the sudden load fluctuation of the sound groove at large amplitude, smooth rotation characteristics are obtained.<br><br>In order to improve the flatness of the record surface, the entire surface of the aluminum die-cast turntable is subjected to surface polishing with diamond to improve the horizontal accuracy of the surface to the same level as that of precision machining mechanisms.<br>In addition, the turntable sheet is finished by center gate injection molding of transparent amorphous polyolefin instead of conventional rubber pressure molding to achieve uniform and highly accurate thickness.<br><br>For the cabinet, a 4-layer polymerization combination cabinet combining materials with different physical properties is adopted for miniaturization and non-resonance.<br>3kg/cm of metal plate for the upper layer, synthetic rubber viscoelastic special resin for the middle layer and impact resistant resin for the lower layer<sup>2</sup>Three layers are bonded under pressure to thoroughly reduce the vibration transmission of the turntable board. In addition, vibration-proof resin with different specific gravity from the body is used for the bottom plate part to prevent the effects of resonance overlapping and howling.<br><br>The insulator has a composite structure combining a spiral coil spring that is particularly effective in low frequencies and a special shape rubber vibration isolator that is highly effective in middle and high frequencies.<br>The resonance frequency formed by the total weight of the player and the player and the compliance of the coil spring, is approximately 10 Hz, and an excellent anti-vibration effect is exhibited in the audible frequency band above this.</p>
