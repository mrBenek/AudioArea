				<p class="detail">This cassette deck was released as the standard model of the ESA series.<br><br>In order to further improve the accuracy of the silent and quick action mechanism deck, it is equipped with a mechanism deck that adopts Lapis (sapphire capstan base system). By using sapphire with high hardness and low friction coefficient for the bearing, rigidity and durability are improved.<br>Combined with the adoption of a 3-phase linear torque BSL motor with less rotational unevenness, this product ensures stable tape running performance.<br><br>High-rigidity zinc die-cast (Bellick) is used for the head base material, which is the base of the head. By eliminating unnecessary vibration and maintaining accurate azimuth accuracy, good phase characteristics between channels are achieved.<br><br>A monocoque zinc die-cast (Bellick) base is used for the base of the motor to reduce modulation noise generated by external vibration such as sound pressure. The motor and base are integrated to provide highly accurate and stable rotational performance.<br><br>A closed-loop dual capstan system has been adopted in which capstan and pinch stan and pinch rollers on both the take-up side and the supply side centering on the tape head. This improves wow and flutter characteristics and reduces modulation noise caused by tape vibration.<br>In addition, the capstan drive adopts a direct drive system equipped with a 3-phase linear torque BSL motor with extremely low rotational unevenness, thus achieving excellent performance.<br><br>To ensure sound purity, the layout of the audio circuit follows the signal flow as closely as possible.<br>In addition, the recording amplifier and the playback amplifier are arranged on two separate boards in upper and lower stages to reduce mutual interference. At the same time, the all-stage twin monaural DC amplifier configuration eliminates interference between channels.<br>In addition, the power supply section has been strengthened to improve sound quality.<br><br>Single-crystalline ESC-OCC wire rod with a purity of 99.997% or more and with almost no grain boundaries is used in important parts of the oxygen-free copper.<br><br>In general, a 3-head deck uses an inductor (coil) to prevent the bias signal, which is inserted through the reproducing head during simultaneous recording and re-recording. However, while the inductor eliminates the bias signal, it is connected in series with the signal path, which adversely affects sound quality.<br>Therefore, the bias signal is effectively eliminated by adopting an active GIC bias filter that does not use a coil or capacitor in the signal path.<br><br>The playback equalizer amplifier section has a two stage configuration consisting of a discrete FET and an OP amplifier for signal amplification. The first stage FET suppresses noise and the second stage OP amplifier amplifies the signal, thus achieving both high sound quality and low noise.<br><br>In order to prevent the deterioration of sound quality caused by the slight flow of the signal current of the system control system to the audio system, a C-MOS buffer capable of low-power operation is used in the signal path of the system control system. This reduces the current value of the signal to about 1/10000 and prevents the adverse effect on the audio signal.<br><br>It is equipped with an input terminal for CD recording that enables recording through a simple signal path.<br><br>It uses a midship drive system. The mechanical deck and power supply are located in the center of the chassis, and the control circuit and audio circuit are separately located on the left and right sides of the chassis. This provides a good weight balance with almost equal weight on the four legs.<br>In addition, by adopting an inner chassis that divides the inside of the chassis into three parts, total rigidity is increased and electromagnetic interference between blocks is eliminated.<br><br>High rigidity and high specific gravity fine ceramic composite material is adopted for the cassette holder, and vibration is suppressed by high rigidity.<br>Aluminum extruding material is used for the cassette lid to improve accuracy.<br><br>It is equipped with a cassette stabilizer. As soon as the tape is loaded into the mechanical deck, the stabilizer inside the cassette door firmly secures the cassette half and reduces vibration of the tape.<br>In particular, the ES Series uses a new material, sorbacein, for the free-action holding arm and stabilizer to absorb harmful vibrations and prevent modulation noise.<br><br>Based on a laser amorphous head that takes advantage of the characteristics of amorphous magnetic alloys, we have adopted a PC-OCC wound laser amorphous head that uses high-purity oxygen-free copper PC-OCC for the head winding.<br><br>A pad pressure reduction system is adopted, and a convex protruding part is provided on the surface of the head so that it touches both ends of the pad on the left and right side in the tape running direction, so that excess pressure of the pad is not applied.<br>This method works effectively especially in the closed loop dual capstan mechanical deck, and realizes an ideal tape contact mainly for tension control in the loop.<br><br>Equipped with Dolby HX Pro, the effective bias amount is controlled to the optimum value in 1/1000 second unit to prevent over-bias and increase linearity in the high frequency range.<br><br>It employs a super-bias, and by greatly shifting up the frequency of the bias signal, the frequency difference with the audio signal is expanded, and generation of beat noise and intermodulation distortion due to mutual interference is suppressed.<br><br>It is equipped with a bias calibration function that can adjust the bias value within ± 20% according to the tape to be used by the built-in oscillator (oscillator), and with a recording level calibration function that eliminates the level difference between recording and playback due to tape sensitivity.<br><br>The power cable is a highly durable cabtire cable with a polarity indicator that allows the polarity of each component to be adjusted.<br><br>Equipped with a CD sync recording function, it can be easily recorded from a CD to a deck by combining it with Sony&#39;s remote-controlled CD player.<br><br>It adopts FL linear electronic counter of minute and second display linked with time.<br>Equipped with a subtraction function that makes it easy to understand the remaining time.<br><br>It is equipped with an auto monitor function that simplifies playback operations. When you press the play button, it automatically switches from the SOURCE position to the TAPE position. You can also choose between auto and manual.<br><br>It is equipped with a peak level meter that displays the peak value of the music signal in real time and also has a peak hold function.<br><br>Equipped with a display mode switch, it can be switched to 3 modes such as full lighting, partial lighting of the counter only, or off.<br><br>Equipped with AMS (Automatic Music Sensor), you can quickly find the beginning of the previous or next song.<br>The ES Series is easy to use with one touch operation.<br><br>It is equipped with the Auto Space REC MUTE function. When you press the REC MUTE button during recording or recording pause, it automatically records silence for approximately four seconds, then sends the tape for that amount and stops temporarily.<br><br>Power loading is adopted, and the cassette is automatically loaded into the mechanical deck just by pressing the operation button such as play or fast forward / rewind without closing the cassette door, and it quickly shifts to each operation mode.<br>This series of operations is also performed when the remote control is operated.<br><br>There are 2 variations, gold and black.<br><br>Wireless remote control for each color model is included.</p>
