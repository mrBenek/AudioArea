				<p class="detail">This is a cassette deck that pursues real clarity of sound with a thorough anti-vibration structure.<br><br>The DR-70G is a color variation model of the DR-70, and there is no difference other than the color of the sidewood.<br><br>The mechanism section is equipped with a highly reliable rotary encoder computer-controlled silent mechanism that employs a closed-loop dual capstan system. This eliminates disturbances such as reel reel vibration between the two capstan pairs, greatly reducing modulation noise caused by tape vibration, and realizes smooth head touch and quiet operation.<br>In the DR-70/DR-70G, the mechanical control and counter display function are controlled by a microcomputer integrated into one chip, which realizes smooth operation.<br><br>The capstan drive motor uses an electronically controlled DC motor with strong torque and smooth rotation. A special rubber damper for vibration control is used to float the capstan to prevent vibration from being transmitted.<br>The take-up capstan uses a fly-wheel with a large moment of inertia, greatly reducing wow and flutter.<br><br>Equipped with a non-stop reel drive mechanism, there is no mechanical friction between the motor and the take-up reel stand, so there is no noise or aging change when the tape is taken up, and uniform constant speed running from the beginning to the end of the tape is possible.<br><br>It is equipped with C. C. C. S (Ceramic Composite Cassette Stabilizer) in order to eliminate adverse effects due to micro vibration of the cassette half.<br>This cassette stabilizer is made of a ceramic composite material. When the cassette half is attached to the cassette, it is firmly fixed by an elastic stabilizer from both sides. This reduces vibration of the half, improves tape running stability and greatly reduces modulation noise.<br><br>An amorphous core PC-OCC head is used for the read / write head.<br>This head uses an amorphous core, which is a high-permeability alloy with no crystal structure, and uses a non-crystalline oxygen-free copper (PC-OCC) for the coil wire to improve high-frequency and MOL characteristics.<br>The head is mounted on a head block made of aluminum die cast, and it is firmly fixed without interfering with the vertical movement of the head.<br><br>Equipped with Dolby HX-PRO.<br>Since this circuit automatically reduces the bias amount from the oscillator when the input signal contains many high frequency components, the high frequency characteristics are greatly improved compared with the conventional fixed bias method while keeping the effective bias value of the middle and low frequency ranges constant.<br><br>Equipped with Dolby B/C NR as a noise reduction system.<br><br>In the amplifier section, both the recording amplifier section and the playback amplifier are configured as DC amplifiers to improve the quality.<br>The playback equalizer amplifier employs an IC that integrates an L/R channel amplifier into a single chip to greatly reduce the noise level generated in the amplifier section. In addition, by connecting the playback head directly to the amplifier, the degradation of low-frequency characteristics due to the coupling capacitor is eliminated. In addition, by supplying high voltage and high stability power with ± 2 power supply configuration, the saturation level of the amplifier section is raised and a wide dynamic range is obtained.<br><br>In order to completely eliminate unnecessary vibration, the top cover is made of steel plate that combines both sides and the top plate, and another steel plate is fixed inside with cushioning adhesive.<br>The bottom cover has a double-layered structure with 1.6 mm thick steel plates and attached to a high-rigidity chassis to reduce the center of gravity.<br><br>Equipped with a REC return key.<br>With this function, the computer memorizes the starting position of the recording, and when the REC return key is pressed, it automatically returns to the starting position and enters the standby state.<br><br>Equipped with a real-time digital counter with a tape size selector.<br><br>When the camera is equipped with an auto tape monitor and the camera is turned on to the Play, Rec, or Play (Rec. Mute) status, the auto tape monitor is set to the tape side and monitors the recorded sound.<br>When Stop, Rec Pause, or otherwise the tape is not busy, it automatically switches to the source side.<br><br>Equipped with FL peak meter with peak hold that can display from -40dB to + 10 dB.<br><br>Equipped with a bias fine adjustment function, the bias can be finely adjusted.<br><br>It is equipped with an MPX filter switch to prevent malfunction of the Dolby system by cutting the 19 khz signal included in the FM signal. This function automatically disables the filter when the Dolby system is not in use.<br><br>Equipped with a CD direct input terminal.<br><br>Equipped with a bias fine adjuster.<br><br>Equipped with a slack prevention mechanism.<br><br>Equipped with a follow-up recording function, you can record directly from the regenerating condition.<br><br>It is equipped with an auto recording space function, and you can leave a 4-second interval between songs.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
