				<p class="detail">The development and installation of the Linear D. D> arm solves the problem that had been a bottleneck until now.<br><br>The Linear D. D. Arm developed by Pioneer Shinkai is mounted in order to move the strong arm base horizontally precisely and quietly. By this, factors that cause harmful noise and vibration are completely eliminated.<br>The Linear D. D. arm is structurally very simple because the magnetic repulsion force generated by electrical energy can be directly converted into linear motion. Unlike conventional systems, the arm base can be directly driven without any transmission mechanism such as a rotary motor, gears, belts, or strings.<br><br>Record sound In order to ensure that the arm base follows the movement of the needle tip that traces the groove, we have adopted a contactless arm shift detection mechanism that combines a cds and a lamp at the arm mounting part. By adding this detection output to a differential amplifier, we constitute a servo system that supplies the required amount of current.<br>Moreover, since this arm shift detection angle is a small angle of 0.2 degrees, quick correction is possible. Moreover, since the arm shift detection mechanism makes accurate response correction not only in the inner circumferential direction of the record but also in the outer circumferential direction, there is no need to worry about unnecessary lateral pressure on the needle tip even if a record with eccentricity is traced, and high traceability is achieved.<br><br>In the linear D. D. arm, a two way servo system is activated by the output voltage of the generator linked to the rotary arm feed section to enable smooth arm feed.<br>All you need to do is to lightly touch the arm feed knob and turn it. The arm moves according to the direction and speed of rotation, and the feel of the fingertip becomes the arm action. This allows you to drop the needle from the middle of the middle of the record and start playing freely.<br>The arm feed mechanism is designed to be safe so that it does not work during the performance of the record, so there is no risk of accidentally damaging the needle tip or the record.<br>In addition, by moving the arm left and right by holding the finger of the arm, the arm shift detection mechanism and the two way servo automatically work to move the arm base, making it possible to perform the same operation with the same feeling as manual player.<br><br>Uses a symmetrical straight arm.<br>Since it is a short type with a short effective length, the inertia mass of the arm is reduced and the equivalent mass is also reduced to improve traceability.<br>The material is a strong aluminum alloy, and since it is not subjected to bending process, the strain inside the pipe is reduced and harmful resonance is suppressed.<br>A dynamic balance method is used for needle pressure application.<br>In addition, it is a universal arm, and various cartridges from all over the world can be attached.<br><br>A 1.4 kg arm base with sufficient strength is used for the arm base.<br><br>Arm height adjustment mechanism is adopted, and suitable vertical tracking angle can be obtained according to the cartridge to be used.<br><br>The SH rotor (Stable Hanging Rotor) system, in which the rotor support point (bearing) is moved just below the turntable, is used for the drive part.<br>As a result, the center of gravity and the position of the supporting point almost coincide with each other, and the fluctuation of the turntable is suppressed.<br><br>The motor has an inertial mass of 380kg-cm.<sup>2</sup>It employs a high-torque brushless DC servo motor that drives the turntable at a constant speed within 1/4 rotation (approximately 1 second). It is designed so that the rotational speed does not vary even under the load of approximately 150 tone arms with a needle pressure of 1.5g.<br><br>High-density conifer particleboard with howling protection is used for the cabinet, and a large insulator with height adjustable up to 6 mm is used for the insulator.<br><br>It uses an electronic arm elevation mechanism that uses a dedicated DC motor, allowing the arm to move up and down smoothly.<br>In addition, it is equipped with an electronic auto-up mechanism that lifts the arm from the board immediately after the end of the recording performance, and the turntable stops as soon as the arm auto-up.<br>No extra lateral pressure is applied to the needle tip as it is non-contact type.<br><br>High-conductivity oxygen-free copper wires are used for all cables for signal transmission systems.<br>The output jacks and terminal pins are gold-plated.<br><br>It is equipped with 5 mm thick acrylic cover.<br><br>It comes with a 7.7x7.7 high precision large level that can level the cabinet.</p>
