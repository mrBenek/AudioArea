				<p class="detail">SACD player SACD player developed as a reference player.<br><br>It uses a new premium design that completely replaces the conventional Marantz design.<br>This design is based on the basic concept of expression by light which is not limited only by shape and arrangement. In addition to the front panel of solid aluminum 3 piece construction, aluminum side panel which firmly supports the inside is adopted.<br><br>It is equipped with Marantz original PEC (Phase Error Compensation) circuit using 24 bitDSP, and realizes flat characteristics of phase delay.<br>In addition, this DSP achieves 8 x oversampling and 1st order noise shaper.<br><br>Equipped with a digital filter 3-mode switching function, both SACD and CD can switch the most suitable digital filter for the system to 3-mode. In addition, the DC filter and noise shaper can be turned ON/OFF during CD playback.<br><br>For CD playback, Filter1 is a filter with an original slow roll-off feature that creates a performance image characteristic of analog records and a rich, smooth, deep sound field, while Filter2 is a filter with a slow roll-off feature that realistically reproduces the mid-low to mid-range range.<br>Filter3 is a filter with standard sharp roll-off characteristics. This filter reproduces the coefficient of SAA7220PB, a digital filter with 4 times operation adopted in CD-94/CD-95/CD-95SE, and has 8 times operation. Compared with Filter1/2, the sound is sharp.<br><br>ON/OFF of the noise shaper and DC filter can be selected for each of the three filters.<br>The noise shaper is a digital feedback, but you can check the difference in the gloss of the sound by turning it ON/OFF. In general, turning it OFF reduces the measurement characteristics, but it expresses the gloss of the sound.<br>The DC filter cuts out sound below 1.7 Hz. Turning the DC filter OFF provides a more natural sound field.<br><br>During SACD playback, Filter1 is a direct mode that does not filter DSD data, so it faithfully reproduces the original source.<br>Filter2 filters and attenuates the portion of DSD data exceeding 100 kHz. In addition, by making the operation in the DAC asymmetric, the resolution of the DAC is given priority and the multi-level can be operated at up to 40 multi-level.<br>Filter3 filters and attenuates the portion of DSD data exceeding 100 kHz. The operation in the DAC is 23 multi-level, fully symmetric operation. This filter has the best characteristics when combined with the I/V conversion in the latter stage.<br><br>The D/A conversion section is equipped with two SM5866AS DACs manufactured by NPC Corporation.<br>This DAC performs 12 times of oversampling internally at the PCM input, and converts 96 times of the total signal, including 8 times of the input signal, into 23 levels by the third noise shaper function, greatly reducing residual quantization noise from the audio signal band to the high frequency band.<br>It has a direct mode that does not pass the internal digital filter when the DSD signal is input, and a Route 3 that attenuates the quantization noise of the DSD in the digital domain through a FIR type digital filter and outputs the current with a 23-40 level DAC.<br>In addition, there is an internal register, and the input data is always written in the word clock and system clock which are compared in phase, and it is accurately read out to be jitter-free.<br><br>It is input to the HDAM construction of the triple stage configuration output from D/AC.<br><br>The I/V conversion section is equipped with a discrete I/V conversion circuit composed of HDAM.<br>By directly coupling the current output of the DAC with the HDAM, we aim to improve the small signal loss that does not appear in the physical characteristics.<br><br>A discrete HDAM circuit is used for the LPF after I/V conversion, and a current feedback type HDAM circuit is used for the output circuit to achieve a low impedance and low noise.<br><br>The output is not only unbalanced but also full balanced analog output using XLR terminal. It is composed of current feedback type HDAM circuit similar to audio output to ensure the same output impedance and performance as unbalanced output.<br><br>The block capacitor used in the power supply section is a custom Marantz product developed through repeated trial manufacture and trial listening. The power transformer is a super-ring toroidal transformer with OFC winding. The case is filled with a high-density material to prevent the vibration of the transformer from affecting sound quality.<br>We use high-quality audio parts such as Schottky barrier diodes and mica capacitors for the rectifying circuit of the audio power supply.<br><br>It is equipped with a digital output whose data is crystal relocked by the master clock.<br>In addition, the SA-11S1 automatically stops the digital output in order to eliminate the effect on SACD playback. In addition, the digital output can be turned off during CD playback.<br><br>Uses brass block machined gold-plated analog terminal.<br><br>A mechanism module developed in-house by Marantz is used for the mechanism part.<br>A stabilizer is mounted on the upper surface of the mechanism to increase rigidity.<br><br>A ± 5 ppm high-precision type crystal is placed near the DAC to supply the optimum clock to the DAC with high precision.<br><br>System remote control is included.</p>
