				<p class="detail">Twin Quick Reverse Cassette Deck with Dolby HX-PRO.<br><br>Both Deck 1 and Deck 2 have built-in recording capabilities for alternate continuous recording, 3-hour voice recording (two 90-minute tapes), simultaneous recording on Deck 1 and Deck 2, and 3-hour recording across two stations with a combination of program tuner and timer.<br>It is also equipped with a continuous play function that automatically returns to the beginning when the second tape ends during playback.<br><br>The Dolby HX-PRO, which greatly improves the high-frequency dynamic range, is installed independently on Deck 1 and Deck 2.<br>As a noise reduction system, Dolby B/C NR is also installed.<br><br>Equipped with synchronized dubbing function, dubbing from Deck 1 to Deck 2 can be done with one touch.<br>Dubbing is available in two speeds, constant speed and double speed. In addition, it is equipped with a synchronous recording mute function. If you stop Deck 1 on the playback side during dubbing or select a song by Music Scan, Deck 2 automatically waits from Rec Mute to a pause state. When recording on Deck 2 ends, Deck 1 also stops. In round-trip mode, during dubbing, Deck 1 continues to play until you finish recording on both sides A and B of Deck 2.<br><br>The reverse mechanism employs a fine axis quick reverse mechanism in which the read / write head and erase head rotate together.<br>With this mechanism, the azimuth in both forward and reverse directions can be adjusted independently, and sound quality is pursued by equalizing driving performance.<br><br>Both decks 1 and 2 are equipped with a quick reverse mechanism that detects the reader tape at both ends of the cassette tape by infrared sensors and quickly reverses the tape. In addition, accurate, quick and quiet reverse operation is realized by 2-motor full logic and mechanical drive motor.<br><br>Both decks 1 and 2 have half-shell stabilizers to reduce the effect on sound quality caused by microvibration of the cassette half. In addition, vibration is eliminated from the cassette half locked only on one side, is locked firmly at both ends to eliminate vibration from the cassette half body.<br>In addition, the accuracy of the rotary system such as the pinch roller and belt has been greatly improved, and by adopting a large flywheel with high stability, rotational unevenness has been reduced.<br><br>A DC amplifier configuration is adopted in which the condenser is removed from the circuit of the amplifier section, and low distortion factor and high linearity are realized.<br><br>Equipped with a synchro terminal, recording can be automatically started at the start of CD playback by connecting with VICTOR/JVC&#39;s CD player equipped with a synchro terminal.<br><br>Equipped with multi-music multi-music scanning function of 9 songs before and after.<br>This function allows the microcomputer to automatically detect the unrecorded portion (4-5 seconds or more) between songs, and to skip up to 9 songs before and after the current song and play them at the beginning.<br><br>It is equipped with FL display, and deck 1 and 2 are equipped with independent 4-digit electronic counter.<br><br>Equipped with a timer start mechanism, and by connecting an optional timer, it is possible to record absence and play an alarm clock.<br><br>Equipped with an auto tape selector that automatically detects the type of tape.<br><br>Equipped with automatic recording mute function.<br><br>It comes with a wireless remote control that can also operate music scanning.</p>
