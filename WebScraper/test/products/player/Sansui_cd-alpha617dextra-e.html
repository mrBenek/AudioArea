				<p class="detail">A CD player with a D/A conversion system equipped with New L. D. C. S.<br><br>The D/A converter is equipped with a new linear and direct D/A conversion system based on the Mash method.<br>In the Mash method, only one reference unit is used and the digital output is obtained by turning on / off according to the digital input information. This reference unit is highly accurate because it uses the frequency generated by crystal oscillation as the reference value. Moreover, since the instantaneous voltage output is only &quot;0&quot; and &quot;1&quot;, there is no digit change, and there is no generation of 0 cross distortion or nonlinear distortion in principle.<br>In addition, S/N is also improved by simultaneously performing high-order oversampling and noise shaping, and high precision is obtained by noise shaping with a differential characteristic that the distribution form of quantization noise is small in the low range and rapidly increases in the high range.<br><br>A discrete balanced low-pass filter is used to balance the output of the D/A converter and prevent unwanted high-frequency components from entering the ground line.<br><br>The mechanical part uses a linear motor with strong driving torque to achieve high-speed access performance and quietness.<br>In addition, it has a triple chassis structure in which coil springs and oil dump are used from the mechanical chassis and sub-chassis to the play chassis, and four parts are floated, improving vibration isolation effect.<br>In addition, the tray loading mechanism and mechanical chassis up / down are equipped with independent motors to ensure smooth mechanism operation.<br>The disc tray is made of liquid crystal polymer, which has excellent vibration absorption characteristics as well as high rigidity and elasticity. This makes it possible to obtain a stable trace, to ensure sound quality, and to achieve excellent dimensional accuracy because of its low expansion coefficient.<br><br>In consideration of the fact that the four servos used in CD players have a significant effect on sound quality, we have incorporated a new dynamic servo system that cancels the crossover distortion of the servo drive amplifier.<br><br>The power supply section uses an independent 6-stabilized power supply. The power supplies for the analog system, digital system, DAC section, servo system and display tube are separately wound to eliminate electrical influence.<br><br>It is equipped with an FL display that can display operation status, elapsed time and remaining time simultaneously.<br>In addition, the display can be turned ON/OFF by remote control operation, and noise of FL tube can be cut by turning it OFF during listening.<br><br>It is equipped with a COMPUEDIT function that is convenient for recording on tapes, etc., and it automatically programs the music that enters into the A/B side, making it possible to make tapes easily and quickly.<br>With TIME EDIT, you can select from all songs that can be recorded at a specified time. You can record within the recording time of the tape.<br>In addition, the Program EDIT function allows you to select songs that can be recorded at a specified time from among preprogrammed songs.<br><br>It is equipped with variable scan, tracking memory, random play, repeat function, etc.<br><br>There was a side wood sold separately.</p>
