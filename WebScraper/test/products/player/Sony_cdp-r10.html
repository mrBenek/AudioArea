				<p class="detail">R10 series CD transport with fixed optical system mechanism.<br><br>An optical system fixing mechanism is adopted for the mechanism part.<br>In a typical CD player, the disc is rotated on a fixed motor shaft, and the optical block for reading is moved from the inner circumference to the outer circumference. This method has the advantage of easy random access, such as moving from the first track to the fifth track, because the optical block is relatively light in weight.<br>However, because the lightweight pickup part is easy to move, it is easily affected by external vibration, and it needs to be assisted by a focus and tracking servo mechanism. When the lens moves in a complicated manner, the servo current increases. This current flows into the ground, and at the same time, flux is emitted from the wire connecting the optical block and the substrate, degrading sound quality.<br>In order to solve this problem, CDP-R10 has a structure in which the optical block is fixed to the mechanism body, which is heavy and strong, and the disk side moves from the inner circumference to the outer circumference. This structure greatly reduces vibration to which the optical block is subjected, and the electric current required for the servo is only required to move the lens slowly to the side, thus reducing sound quality degradation.<br><br>A turntable system is adopted to reduce the effect of vibration on the disk side.<br>In the CDP-R10, the disk is mounted on an aluminum alloy turntable and fixed with a chucking pulley that generates high crimping force.<br><br>A non-servo thread mechanism is used for thread control to move the turntable side.<br>The CDP-R10 thread control does not always move during the performance. It is structured to move intermittently at a rate of approximately 100 μ m once every 10 to 20 seconds, and the operation becomes more stable by taking a longer time of stopping.<br>In the non-servo thread mechanism, the timing of movement is determined by a theoretical amount calculated by a microprocessor, and the drive is performed by using a mechanically backlash free worm gear mechanism. The worm gear mechanism does not move even when a driving force is applied from the turntable side. It does not require electric power to stop, so it has an advantage in sound quality.<br><br>The turntable is mounted on a bearing block containing a motor. The bearing block moves on a mechanical base to which the optical system is fixed by means of a thread control. To rattling during movement, the rails installed on the mechanical base are mirror-finished so that the bearing block wheels roll on the rails.<br>The three main wheels ensure flatness, two side wheels maintain lateral accuracy, and five wheels maintain straightness. In addition, the bearing block and the mechanical base are attracted by magnetic force. The bearing block and the turntable are heavy and have a structure that is resistant to external vibration due to magnetic attraction between the bearing block and the mechanical base.<br><br>Two wireless remote controls are included.</p>
