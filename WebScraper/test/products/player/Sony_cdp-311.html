				<p class="detail">CD player equipped with newly developed hybrid pulse D/A converter.<br><br>The D/A converter is equipped with a newly developed hybrid pulse D/A converter that uses Sony&#39;s unique noise-shaping method.<br>This circuit improves the signal-to-noise ratio by incorporating a noise-shaping digital filter that performs high-precision oversampling operation in the D/A converter itself. At the same time, the signal path is simplified by using a single chip, and signal degradation due to jitter is minimized by improving the function of the direct digital sink formed on the same chip.<br><br>It is equipped with a direct digital sink and the master clock is formed on the same chip as the pulse D/A converter. This allows the electronic switch of the pulse D/A converter to be turned on and off more accurately, eliminating harmful jitter and reducing sound quality degradation.<br><br>The servo circuit uses a high-precision digital servo.<br>In this circuit, the signal from the optical pickup is A/D converted, filtered and controlled by digital processing, and then D/A converted again to operate the optical pickup, making it possible to adjust the servo amount according to each disc.<br>The high-precision servo uses a high-sampling rate, high-precision, high-resolution A/D converter and D/A converter to realize a more ideal servocontrol and low power consumption by digitizing.<br><br></p>

            <p class="detail">Equipped with a custom edit function, it has six functions : peak search, time edit, program edit, time fade, variable fade and manual fader.<br><br>In peak search, all songs are searched at high speed, and they are repeatedly played for about 4 seconds before and after the point where the volume level is highest.<br><br>Time Edit enables efficient editing of the A-side and B-side when recording tapes.<br>If you want to edit to fit the length of your tape, use the TIME SET button or AMS button to set the length of the tape (you can also use the direct key to set the length in seconds). Press the Edit button. First, program from the first song for side A. When you encounter a time-over song, select the longest song that fits within the time. Then press the Edit button to edit side B.<br>Also, if you select and edit a half disk with the AMS button, tracks are distributed so that the A side and B side of the tape are about the same length without changing the order of the songs.<br><br>Program Edit allows you to manually edit your favorite songs in any order.<br>Use the AMS key or direct key to program your favorite songs in the desired order while checking the accumulated time. Press the pause button to program the A side and then the B side together.<br><br>Time Fade allows you to fade out at a specified time, which can be set with the TIME SET button or the AMS button.<br><br>You can set the fade-in / fade-out time for the variable fade from 2 seconds to 10 seconds in units of 1 second.<br><br>The manual fader allows you to fade in and fade out at the desired location.<br><br></p>
