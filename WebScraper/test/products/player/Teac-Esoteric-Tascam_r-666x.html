				<p class="detail">Quick reverse deck with rotary reverse head.<br><br>The head section is equipped with a rotary type A. R. H. S. (Acculign Rotating Head System) that integrates a read / write head and an erase head.<br>In the rotary head system, both sides of the A/B are recorded and reproduced with a single head, so the difference in sound quality between the A/B sides is minimized.<br>The rotating shaft is coated with Teflon coating with excellent friction coefficient to obtain high durability. In addition, the azimuth in both directions is adjusted with high precision by the precision azimuth adjustment screw to achieve uniform running characteristics in both directions.<br>The tape end detection sensor is equipped with a transmission type I. R. (infrared ray) sensor. It detects the leader tape and performs quick reverse simultaneously with the attraction with the DC motor for driving the mechanism.<br><br>A 2-motor configuration is used for the tape travel mechanism. A high-precision DC servo motor is used for the capstan, a DC motor is used for the reel, and an independent DC motor is used to drive the mechanism and rotate the head.<br>In addition, operation noise is reduced by not using a solenoid, and the 3S mechanism of soft, smooth and silent is realized.<br><br>As a noise reduction system, in addition to Dolby B/C type, dbxNR is also installed.<br>DbxNR is a professional standard noise reduction system developed by dbx Co., Ltd. and consists of ultra-precision electronic circuits. dbxNR reduces the tape hissing by 30 to 40 dB by compressing the dynamic range of the input signal to 1/2 in decibels for recording and expanding it to exactly twice during playback. In addition, it can acquire a dynamic range of 110 dB, exceeding the limit of the cassette, and is capable of recording CDs.<br><br>Equipped with a dbxDISC position where you can listen to dbx records.<br><br>Computomatic Program Search (CPS) is installed as a music selection function.<br>With this function, you can search up to 15 songs in both directions through the A/B plane. When searching in the forward direction, the song being played is counted as one song.<br><br>It is equipped with an intro check function, and with one touch, only the head part of each song is played one after another for about 10 seconds. If you press the Play button for the song you want to listen to, you can listen to the song as it is.<br><br>Equipped with a block repeat function.<br>This function automatically repeats playback and rewinding between blocks specified by Start M (memory) and Stop M. When rewinding, the microcomputer determines the shortest distance.<br>Blocks over both A and B sides are also possible.<br><br>Equipped with a blank scan function.<br>This function automatically fast-forwards when a silent portion of the tape lasts for more than about 10 seconds and restarts at the beginning of the next silent portion.<br><br>Equipped with an auto tape selector, it automatically detects the type of tape (Normal, CrO2, Metal) and can automatically set the bias and EQ circuit.<br><br>Equipped with auto control reverse mode function.<br>It automatically switches between A-B Oatley verse for recording and A-B-A repeat operation for playback.<br><br>Equipped with 4-digit LED multi-counter.<br>This meter functions as a tape running timer that displays tape running in minutes and seconds with the Mode switch, and specifies the designated music number during CPS operation.<br><br>In addition to the individual preset volumes on the left and right, there is also a slide-type master control.<br>The L/R preset volume and the output volume have half-under control knobs to prevent misoperation.<br><br>It is equipped with a multi-operation indicator that shows the Play/Rec traveling direction at a glance.<br><br>Equipped with one push recording mechanism, quick recording is possible just by pressing the Rec button.<br><br>Equipped with the Rec Mute function, you can automatically set a silent space of approximately 4.5 seconds with one push during recording. You can also set as much silent space as necessary by pressing and holding it.<br><br>Equipped with 2 color 13-dot full-scale LED peak level indicator.<br><br>Equipped with a timer standby mechanism, recording of absence and alarm clock playback are possible by combining with a separately sold timer.</p>
