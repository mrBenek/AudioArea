				<p class="detail">A DAT deck equipped with a broadband (HS : High Sampling) mode capable of 96 khz high sampling.<br><br>It uses a wide-band mode with a frequency of 96 kHz, twice that of conventional 48 kHz sampling. With this mode, the range is expanded to ultra-high frequencies and the smooth sound characteristic of the wide-band mode is obtained.<br>In the wide-band mode, the signal processing LSI, capstan motor and drum motor operate at twice the speed of the standard mode, enabling recording and playback at frequencies exceeding 40 kHz. In the wide-band mode, the recording time is halved because the tape runs at twice the speed.<br>(The wide-band HS mode has the same function as the WIDE mode of the D-07, and the name has been changed.)<br><br>In order to get closer to the original signal waveform, a legato link conversion is installed.<br>This system performs digital signal processing based on the signal recorded on the tape and connects the data with a smooth function curve to obtain sound reproduction close to the original before recording on the tape. It also estimates the original signal before recording and reproduces sound of 20 kHz or higher according to the 1/f attenuation characteristic to achieve more natural sound reproduction.<br><br>The long duration (LP) mode allows twice the recording time of the standard (SP) mode for analog input recording and digital input recording with a sampling frequency of 32 kHz. This enables continuous recording for up to four hours on 120 minute tapes.<br><br>Uses a high-output AT head.<br>It is an all-track structure head with 20 μ m uniform track processing in the track trace direction. Glass is welded on both sides of the head to ensure abrasion resistance. In addition, a special polishing process is applied to the gap to realize a stable tape touch.<br><br>The newly developed 1-bit wide-range linear A/D converter and high-speed pulse flow 1-bit D/A converter are used in the conversion section. The 1-bit method has excellent linearity and is free from non-linear distortion and 0 cross distortion in principle. It reduces conversion errors in minute signals and improves linearity.<br><br>It is equipped with a TOC function that records information such as program time and length of each song at the beginning of the tape.<br>This function enables DAT to manage information such as the total number and time of songs, the song time of each song, the start time of each song, and the remaining time of the recorded part.<br><br>It is equipped with high-speed AI search and subcode application functions. It reads subcode information recorded on the tape to learn the song number and the starting position of the song, and realizes high-speed AI search up to about 300 times (about 600 times for LP) by using this information.<br>You can also record and erase various time information, a start ID that indicates the beginning of a song, a skip ID that is convenient for skipping a part you do not want to listen to, a pole number information, and an end ID that indicates the end of recording.<br><br>At the beginning of each song (start ID part), you can store up to 60 characters of data such as the name of the song, the performer, and notes. The data can be recorded either on the remote control or on the console. The recorded information is scrolled on the counter display when each song starts.<br><br>Equipped with a CD-Q code sync start ID recording function, start ID can be automatically recorded based on the track number and index in the CD-Q code data transmitted to the D-05 through the digital interface when recording digital input from CD.<br><br>To eliminate adverse effects caused by clock signal fluctuations, we have adopted a clean clock circuit that separates the clock signal from both audio and digital signals.<br>As a result, the oscillation itself of the clock that controls the system is cleared, and S/N and distortion factor are improved by driving independently.<br><br>The chassis uses a honeycomb chassis with excellent vibration damping characteristics. The midship structure with the drive mechanism in the center improves the weight balance and suppresses vibration and resonance.<br>In addition, in order to effectively suppress the vibration of the cassette half, it is equipped with a cassette stabilizer unique to Pioneer. The cassette half is sandwiched by special rubber at the top and bottom, and is further pressed by resin at two places on the left and right, so that the cassette half is firmly fixed.<br><br>Equipped with the last memory function, the AUTO ID on/off and input switching status are recorded even when the power is turned off.<br><br>We use carefully selected parts in order to respond to broadband.</p>
