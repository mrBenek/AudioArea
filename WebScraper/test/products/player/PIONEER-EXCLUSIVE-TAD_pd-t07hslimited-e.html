				<p class="detail">This is a limited model CD player that was developed by gathering the wide range technology of pioneer who pursued high quality digital sound.<br><br>It is equipped with Hi-bit, Pioneer&#39;s original technology.<br>In order to estimate the waveform of the original sound from the d-eta stored on the CD, we focused on the small-level signal less than the number of quantization bits. We requantized 16-bit data in the CD format to 24-bit data, and expanded the dynamic range to 120 dB, the maximum amount that can be perceived by the human ear, while reducing quantization distortion.<br><br>It is equipped with Legato link conversion S, and the waveform of the original signal is estimated and reproduced based on 1/f attenuation characteristics for the component of 20 khz or more which is not recorded on CD.<br>In addition, an independent harmonic generation circuit has been added to the overtone. Based on the attenuation characteristics estimated from the original sound, overtone components above 20 kHz are also generated. By adding these components together with the time axis, the playback band is expanded to 50 kHz, while eliminating unnecessary ringing.<br><br>The D/A converter section, which converts 24-bit data reproduced by the Hi-bit Legato Link Conversion S into analog data, is equipped with a newly developed wide-range DAC.<br>By integrating two multi-bit DACs with the same characteristics into one chip, eliminating 0 cross distortion and glisziness, and widening the frequency band to 50 kHz, more faithful analog conversion is realized.<br><br>The newly developed magnetic barrier substrate coated with magnetic material on the circuit board is used to suppress generation and propagation of digital noise.<br>In addition, the digital / servo and audio boards are separated independently to prevent noise generation and propagation within the set.<br><br>A specially designed high-quality part &quot;Great Supply&quot; is used for the rectifier condenser, and a twin power transformer for digital &amp; servo and analog circuits is installed to prevent noise generation due to interference of circuits.<br>In addition, the power supply circuit independently rectifies 5 parts of digital &amp; servo, servo drive, D/A converter, audio + and - by means of a 5-part, 13-regulator to prevent interference between the power supply and the circuit. In addition, an independently developed discrete low-impedance power supply circuit is used for the analog output to prevent impedance increase and external noise in the power transmission line.<br><br>It is equipped with a clean laser pickup developed in-house.<br>This pickup reduces power loss by eliminating optical components such as the collimator lens, and realizes signal folding with low distortion.<br><br>A class A FET buffer amplifier is installed in the audio circuit after D/A conversion to prevent signal degradation.<br><br>A large brushless hole motor (high starting torque 65g ・ cm) is mounted on a 4.5 mm diameter extra-thick shaft / spindle motor.<br><br>It adopts a multi-layered honeycomb chassis with excellent vibration control, and uses a lamisert mechanical base molded with special resin and overlapping different metals for the mechanical base.<br>In addition, a floating structure has been adopted to improve vibration control and vibration isolation.<br><br>Equipped with a unique CD turntable mechanism that reduces unnecessary vibration of the disk.<br>Moment of inertia is improved by about 3 times by supporting the disk from the bottom to the whole surface.<br><br>It uses direct construction with the shortest signal path, connects analog circuits in the shortest distance, and is shielded by copper-plated steel sheet.<br><br>It is equipped with Computer Program Edit which changes the order of songs to minimize the remaining time of the tape just by setting the time of the tape with the remote control, Time Fade Edit which automatically fades out to a pause state when the tape time is specified, and Auto Program Edit which judges how many songs can be recorded and records the last song without interruption when the tape time is specified.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
