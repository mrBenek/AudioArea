				<p class="detail">A stereo cassette deck with thorough measures against resonance and vibration.<br><br>An arc base is adopted to attenuate vibration such as vibration when the mechanism is activated.<br>The arc base is based on a high-density compression-molded board made from approximately 1 kg of soft wood with a good sound. Moreover, the entire surface is held by a steel plate 3.2 mm thick and weighing approximately 2.5 kg. A high-rigidity mechanical holder containing glass fibers is fixed and integrated with the chassis base. The high-rigidity base is not simply connected to the main body. From the basic design, no resonance and no vibration are ensured.<br>Moreover, this arc base incorporates an inner chassis that divides each part of the analog section related to sound quality into five blocks and is directly fixed. This strengthens the chassis structure and reduces interference between the recording section, playback section, power supply section, bias oscillation section, and input circuit section. In addition, the digital operation section is concentrated in one location to prevent interference with the analog section.<br><br>The newly developed Airtight electric cassette door is used for the cassette door.<br>Compared with conventional cassette doors, this cassette door has a smaller window area to increase the weight. In addition, it is equipped with airtight rubber to increase the sealing degree with the main body. By opening and closing the cassette door electrically, the sound pressure from the speaker is cut off to prevent the mechanism from affecting parts and tapes.<br>In addition, vibration of the cassette half itself is suppressed by a half shell stabilizer to reduce acoustic modulation noise.<br><br>The head section uses an independent 3-head system, and the sound quality is improved by adjusting the recording head and reproducing head appropriately. In addition, the recording head and reproducing head use a fine amorphous head, and a good balance of head characteristics is achieved by combining the characteristics of an amorphous head with excellent high-frequency characteristics and an SA (Senalloy) head with excellent magnetic characteristics and abrasion resistance.<br>In addition, PC-OCC (single-crystal high-purity oxygen-free copper material) with greatly reduced signal loss is used for the coil winding and lead wire of the head to improve sound quality.<br><br>A closed-loop dual capstan mechanism using a direct drive motor is adopted for the mechanism part.<br>In this mechanism, capstan and pinch rollers are arranged on both sides of an independent head. By keeping the tension constant from the beginning to the end of winding the tape, stable head touch is always realized. Moreover, since the tape is held between two capstan, it has the effect of making disturbance vibration difficult to transmit.<br>In addition, aluminum die-cast is used for the mechanical base to greatly improve the verticality, parallelism, and vibration resistance of the capstan and pinch roller shafts. Steel plates are stacked on the motor substrate to cope with mechanical vibration, thus effectively reducing total modulation noise, including acoustic modulation noise caused by external vibration.<br>By using a 3-phase 6-coil Ceralock servo direct drive motor, excellent wow flutter characteristics have been obtained.<br><br>The amplifier section uses a DC servo amplifier to improve the S/N ratio by 3-4dB in the low band and 1-2dB in the high band. In addition, high-quality sound parts are used in the details to improve the sound quality.<br>In addition, by setting the bias frequency to a high level of 210 kHz (erasure 105 kHz), sound quality with almost no beat with the signal current is achieved.<br><br>The power supply section employs a low output impedance power supply with ± tracking control using a large transformer with OFC winding and a large capacitor. In this circuit, the positive and negative sides work together so that the ground potential is always 0. Therefore, the stability of the amplifier is maintained. Moreover, by combining a high-gain voltage comparison circuit and a constant-current control circuit with excellent high-frequency characteristics, we have succeeded in reducing the output impedance to less than 1m Ω in the audio audio frequency band.<br>In addition, the power supply is supplied to each circuit through a dedicated line to suppress current changes, eliminating interference between circuits.<br><br>The FL display can be turned off during recording and playback to eliminate the influence of digital noise. The FL display turns on during stop, fast-forward, rewind and pause even when the display is off, and automatically turns off when recording or playback starts.<br>With the digital peak call button, you can call up the maximum peak numerically and check the level.<br><br>In order to record sound as it is without being affected by noise or circuit, it is equipped with two direct inputs, one of which adopts the new CD fine direct input method.<br>The CD Fine Direct Input uses a high sound quality detent volume with a low impedance that is approximately 1/10 of the input impedance of the normal volume to reduce noise emitted from the volume. Furthermore, the low impedance of the recording input circuit reduces the negative effects of pin codes and volume, greatly improving the high-frequency characteristics, distortion, and phase characteristics, and improving the dynamic range of the recording amplifier by approximately 6 dB over almost all bands.<br><br>To prevent noise from entering the signal path, a remote bar is used for the selector and detent volume, and the front panel operation is controlled near the rear panel input terminal.<br><br>It is equipped with Dolby B/C NR as a noise reduction system and Dolby HX-PRO to improve sound quality during recording. The TD-V931 is equipped with an NR defeat circuit that can be disconnected when the Dolby circuit is not in use. It is also equipped with a direct signal path function that enables signal transmission over the shortest distance with a single switch.<br><br>It is equipped with an auto monitor function that automatically switches and outputs the sound of the tape immediately after recording during recording and the sound of the source during pause standby.<br><br>Equipped with an automatic music selection function.<br><br>Uses OFC thick power cord with polarity display and gold-plated input / output terminal.<br><br>Equipped with REC calibration (level bias) function.<br><br>Equipped with a timer start mechanism, and by connecting an optional timer, it is possible to record absence and play an alarm clock.<br><br>Equipped with a headphone port with volume.<br><br>Equipped with synchronous terminal.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
