				<p class="detail">A CD player equipped with an I-PDM D/A converter.<br><br>The newly developed I-PDM (Independent Pulse Density Modulation) system is used in the D/A converter.<br>In this method, the output pulse is made independent so that even if the output waveform is not ideal, it can be accurately converted into an analog waveform as long as the independent pulses have the same area, so that no distortion occurs in the analog waveform in principle.<br><br>The noise shaping method employs a second order noise shaping method that can theoretically ensure an S/N ratio of 140 dB or higher within the audio band and reduce noise from 100 kHz to 500 kHz. This eliminates the need for an analog filter with a steep low-pass filter, which is disadvantageous in terms of sound quality. Thus, superior sound quality is achieved.<br><br>The low-pass filter uses a high-mass passive low-pass filter with high accuracy and large capacity. This low-pass filter uses a passive low-pass filter, which provides better sound quality than conventional active filters. In addition, the core material, copper wires, and the direction of coil winding are carefully examined to use a core material with a capacity several times that of an ordinary one, thus realizing a filter with a wide dynamic range up to magnetic saturation.<br><br>All the amplifiers of the analog audio section are class A operation fixed output to suppress signal degradation.<br><br>The main circuit board is a double-sided copper foil board that reduces transmission loss and high-frequency noise.<br><br>In order to prevent distortion and noise caused by interference between the digital and audio sections, a configuration separated from the power supply section is adopted.<br>The power transformer has separate windings for the digital / mechanical / display section and audio section, and the power supply circuit has an independent board structure to realize clean power supply.<br><br>The chassis and body are designed to be extremely heavy to achieve non-resonance and high rigidity. In addition to the double-top top with a double-top top cover, a double-construction chassis with a double-bottom plate is also adopted to reduce internal and external vibrations, which can cause muddy sound.<br><br>Yamaha&#39;s original GP legs are used for the legs.<br>The GP leg consists of an inverted conical pinpoint leg and a large anti-vibration leg. When the anti-vibration leg is removed, the GP leg can support the load at the pinpoint point. Even when the anti-vibration leg is attached, the pinpoint leg works, and the player&#39;s load is always supported at the point to suppress external vibration.<br>The height of the anti-vibration leg can be variable.<br><br>The mechanism uses an anti-vibration floating mechanism that floats only the necessary parts in the minimum unit. In addition, a stable drive is realized by firmly pressing the disk with a magnet clamp.<br>In addition to the high-rigidity extruded aluminum material, Yamaha&#39;s original GT tray has been added with a damping disk mat utilizing the technology cultivated in GT Player.<br><br>The disk drive uses a vibration control brushless motor with a 4 mm φ extra-thick shaft to reduce vibration.<br>Also, a high-speed linear motor is used for the pickup.<br><br>Equipped with a program file function, it can store up to 100 programs per disc (when 10 songs are programmed) and play programs automatically when the same disc is played.<br><br>10-key direct access is available.<br><br>Equipped with an index search.<br><br>5-mode repeat of one song, all songs, program songs, between A and B, and between indexes is possible.<br><br>Random program play is possible.<br><br>Equipped with a tape edit function.<br><br>Program play of 25 songs is possible.<br><br>Delete program play is available.<br><br>Equipped with auto-space function.<br><br>Timer play is possible by connecting an external timer.<br><br>Wireless remote controller with remote control volume is included.<br><br>There are 2 color variations of titanium and black.</p>
