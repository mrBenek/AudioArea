				<p class="detail">This is a stereo cassette deck with Akai&#39;s unique technologies such as Twin Field and Super GX Head.<br><br>The head uses AKAI&#39;s unique Twin Field Super GX head with a recording gap (4 μ) and a reproducing gap (1 μ) in one head housing.<br>Crystal ferrite with High and High μ is used for the core, and metal tape support is also realized.<br><br>The capstan drive uses an FG servo DD motor with high rotational accuracy, low wow, flutter, and high torque. The FG servo stabilized by the FG servo control.<br>In addition, a high-torque DC motor is used for the reel drive motor, which is combined with a simple reel drive mechanism with high transmission efficiency to further enhance the quality of the drive system.<br><br>The mechanism is equipped with a new mechanism, the quick and quiet mechanism.<br>Each mode is set by a compact system control mechanism with a dedicated motor controlled by a microcomputer. This reduces mechanical noise. In addition, even in the stop state, the head block is lifted up to the conventional pose position, so the start of play operation is quick and durability is excellent.<br><br>The recorder / re-amplifier and microphone amplifier are configured as a DC amplifier with + - 2 power supply system, and various characteristics are improved by using carefully selected devices.<br><br>It is equipped with a direct lead-in system. When the cassette half is set in the ejected state, it is loaded automatically by pressing the desired operation button. It removes the slack of the tape and starts the instructed operation.<br>Also, the eject mechanism is a microcomputer controlled power drive system, and if you press the eject button during play, it will eject automatically.<br><br>Equipped with an auto tape selector climate that automatically detects the tape position just by loading the cassette half.<br>At the same time as detection, the bias and equalizer are set to the AKA reference value to prevent recording errors.<br><br>The meter is equipped with 2-color 12-segment FL bar meter.<br>The tape position indication is also provided on the meter to indicate the warning zone of the maximum recording input level according to the tape position, making it easy to set the level.<br><br>Equipped with a rec-cancel mechanism, when recording a CM or recording timing is wrong, recording can be stopped with one touch, rewound to between songs, recorded without sound for 4 seconds, and set to recording standby.<br>In addition, it is equipped with an introscan that allows you to search for a song you want to listen to by skipping the head of the next song every 10 seconds, an IPLS (Automatic Head-Out) mechanism that automatically calls up the head of the previous or next song with one touch, and a memory autoplay mechanism that automatically starts play by rewinding to counter 0000 position.<br><br>As a noise reduction system, C type is installed in addition to the conventional Dolby B type.<br><br>Equipped with an automatic computer tuning system.<br>The optimum tuning for the tape to be used is automatically carried out and the tape characteristics are drawn out. The bias setting detects the level with Rch, changes the bias sequentially in 8 steps of 2.5% in 1 step, records the same level with 1 kHz and 10 kHz as a pair, and the optimum bias value is set when the levels of 1 kHz and 10 kHz match.<br>The recording sensitivity level is also set to match the 1 kHz reference level by recording a 1 kHz signal in 8 1-dB steps.<br>The tuning time is approximately 25 seconds, and as soon as the tuning is finished, the tape is rewound and on the recording standby mode, making it possible to record any tape with flat frequency characteristics. The tuning operation is controlled by a microcomputer dedicated to tuning. Once the data is tuned, it can be stored one by one for each tape position. This eliminates the need to retune the next time a similar tape of the same brand is used.<br>In addition, it is equipped with a tuning-rec position, and since recording starts after auto-tape tuning even when timer recording is performed, high-quality recorded messages can be recorded.<br><br>Equipped with an auto fader, you can fade in and fade out with one touch in recording mode.<br>In the Recording Standby mode, press this button to automatically fade in to the set recording level and start recording. Conversely, press this button during recording to automatically fade out to create a silent recording part and set the mode to Recording Standby.<br><br>It is equipped with a timer start mechanism, and by connecting a timer sold separately, you can record messages and play an alarm clock.<br>In addition, it can be operated from a remote location by using the separately sold remote control unit.</p>
