				<p class="detail">Stereo cassette deck with independent 3-head configuration.<br><br>The head section uses an independent 3-head configuration in which recording, playback and erasing are performed by dedicated heads respectively.<br><br>Newly developed fine amorphous is used for the head material. This head combines the characteristics of SA head with excellent magnetic characteristics and abrasion resistance with amorphous with excellent high-frequency characteristics to achieve well-balanced head characteristics.<br>In addition, PC-OCC (single-crystal high-purity oxygen-free copper material) is used for the coil winding and lead wire of the head to greatly reduce signal loss.<br><br>Closed-loop dual capstan system is adopted for the mechanism part.<br>In this method, the tension of the tape is kept constant from the beginning to the end by arranging capstan and pinch roller on both sides of the independent head, and the head touch is always stabilized. Moreover, the tape is held between the two capstan, and disturbance vibration is hardly transmitted.<br>In addition, aluminum die-cast is used for the mechanical base, greatly improving the verticality, parallelism, and vibration resistance of the capstan and pinch roller shafts. In addition, steel plates are stacked on the motor substrate to cope with mechanical vibration. This effectively reduces total modulation noise, including acoustic modulation noise caused by external vibration.<br><br>A 3-phase 6-coil Ceralock servo direct drive motor is used as the drive motor.<br><br>A DC servo amplifier is used in the amplifier section to improve the S/N ratio by 3 to 4 dB in the low range and 1 to 2 dB in the high range.<br>In addition to the use of carefully selected high-quality parts, the OFC board with high transmission efficiency is used for the signal board.<br><br>The bias frequency is set to 210 kHz (erase 105 kHz) to suppress the beat with the signal current.<br><br>The signal path is designed to be as short as possible in order to prevent noise contamination and degradation of characteristics due to routing of the signal path.<br>The front panel power switch, input selector and input level volume are connected via a remote bar so that they can be controlled close to the rear panel input terminal.<br><br>The power supply section employs a low output impedance power supply with ± tracking control using a large transformer with OFC winding and a large capacitor. In this circuit, the positive and negative sides work together so that the ground potential is always 0, thereby maintaining the stability of the amplifier. Moreover, by combining a high-gain voltage comparison circuit and a constant-current control circuit with excellent high-frequency characteristics, the output impedance is reduced to less than 1m Ω in the audio frequency band. This realizes a stabilized power supply resistant to complex disturbance noise.<br>In addition, by supplying power to each circuit through a dedicated line, mutual interference between circuits is eliminated.<br><br>It has a structure in which three blocks, power supply, recording / re-independent amplifier, and control are separated independently.<br>In the TD-V721, the microcomputer and display parts are concentrated in one place, and each board is separated by an inner chassis. In addition, in order to eliminate magnetic retention from power transformers, etc., the recording and reproduction systems of the amplifier are separated and shielded by a special copper-plated chassis, thereby eliminating interference from the recording system.<br><br>The FL display, which is a source of digital noise, can be turned off during recording and playback.<br>Even when it is OFF, it lights up during stop, fast forward, rewind, or pause. It is automatically turned OFF when recording or playback starts. After recording, you can call up the maximum peak numerically using the Digital Peak Call button.<br><br>In order to reduce acoustic modulation noise caused by external vibration, the front panel uses a high-density mold base with a specific gravity of approximately 1.5 times and a rigidity of approximately 1.7 times. Switches and mechanical buttons are also made of aluminum material. The lower body is equipped with a high-rigidity heavyweight solid base, which realizes low center of gravity and vibration control structure.<br><br>Equipped with a half-shell stabilizer to prevent vibration of the cassette itself.<br><br>Equipped with Dolby B/C NR as a noise reduction system.<br><br>Equipped with Dolby HX-PRO.<br>This circuit controls the effective bias to be constant according to the fluctuation of the input signal during recording. This circuit can greatly improve the high-frequency dynamic range. Since this system operates only during recording, recorded tapes can be played in high quality on other decks.<br><br>The Dolby B/C NR and Dolby HX-PRO can be removed from the circuit by switching the switch.<br><br>Equipped with a direct input terminal for direct connection to digital sources such as CDs.<br>For direct input, direct recording is performed without passing through the balance volume, and even the bias and wrap (for NR OFF playback) are separated in TD-V721.<br><br>Equipped with an auto monitor function, you can automatically switch and output the sound of the tape immediately after recording during recording, and the sound of the source during pause standby.<br><br>Equipped with an automatic music selection function.<br><br>Uses an OFC thick power cord with polarity indication.<br><br>Uses gold-plated input / output terminals.<br><br>Equipped with REC calibration function (level bias).<br><br>Equipped with timer start mechanism, recording and playback are possible by connecting an optional timer.<br><br>Equipped with a headphone port with volume.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
