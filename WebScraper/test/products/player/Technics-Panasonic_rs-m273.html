				<p class="detail">A stereo cassette deck equipped with a 3-head, 2-motor, and electronic counter as a deck of the Technics &quot;Impact&quot; cassette deck series.<br><br>SX Sendust Combination Head, which uses laminated Sendust as head material, is used for recording and reproducing head.<br>The laminated SENDUST is finished as a combination head in which the optimum gap for recording and playback can be selected independently. This eliminates the vertical gap between the heads that is a problem in a 3-head system. In addition, since it has excellent azimuth (vertical) characteristics, there is no need to worry about high-frequency degradation or phase gap between channels.<br><br>The erasing head uses a double-gap ferrite head made of ferrite material with high saturation magnetic flux density and low high-frequency loss. The compact shape with loop-free placement of the double capstan ensures stable head touch and increases erasing efficiency.<br><br>3-head system allows simultaneous recording and monitoring.<br>The source and tape can be switched with a switch on the front panel, and the sound quality can be checked by listening comparison.<br><br>The amplifier section is designed based on the concept of low noise and low distortion to improve linearity.<br>In addition, a dedicated high-gain amplifier is adopted for the headphone, and the monitor for recording is also possible for the headphone.<br><br>Equipped with a 3-head system indicator, a 3-head symbolic display for erasing, recording, and playback is laid out on the left side of the tape counter and the recording monitor status can be checked.<br><br>A 2-motor double capstan mechanism is adopted for the mechanism part.<br>The capstan drive is equipped with an electronically controlled DC motor that controls the rotation by an electronic circuit, while the reel drive is equipped with a DC motor to ensure stable tape travel.<br>In addition, it is a double capstan design in which two capstan are arranged on the tape feeding side and the tape winding side. The two capstan with a precision finish of 0.1 micron roundness are of a type with a minute difference in diameter. It obtains an appropriate back tension and realizes a stable head touch.<br><br>The control section uses computer logic with a microprocessor to ensure the correct operation of the mechanism and allows direct switching from ff/rew to play.<br><br>Equipped with a digital tape counter, it achieves higher accuracy and reliability than mechanical counters.<br>To detect the number of revolutions, a Hall element attached to the bottom of the reel unit catches the signal, calculates it with a computer, and converts it to digital.<br>The display is designed with four bars added to the three digit number, and the number changes after each bar lights up.<br><br>You can play various games by using the digital counter.<br>The repeat position of the Memory button allows you to automatically repeat from the beginning of the tape to 000, from 000 to the end of the tape, or from 000 to the beginning of the tape to repeat the entire tape.<br>At the stop position of the memory button, you can play from the beginning and stop at position 000, fast forward from the beginning and stop at position 000, and rewind from the end and stop at position 000.<br><br>Equipped with an auto tape selector, it detects the tape type detection hole on the back side of the cassette half and automatically sets the tape position. The set position is indicated by an indicator.<br>In addition, it is equipped with a bias adjuster that severe adjustment.<br><br>Equipped with 18-segment 2-color peak hold FL display.<br><br>Double Dolby NR circuit is mounted.<br><br>Equipped with an auto input selector that automatically switches to microphone input when the microphone plug is turned on.<br><br>Equipped with an output volume.<br><br>Recording can be performed by the separately sold timer.<br><br>Remote control is possible by the separately sold remote controller.</p>
