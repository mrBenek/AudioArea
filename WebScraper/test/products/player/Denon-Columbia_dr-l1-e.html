				<p class="detail">A quick reverse deck with improved cost performance by omitting some functions from the DR-L2.<br><br>A 4-track head system has been adopted for the head part which is a problem in the quick reverse deck.<br>In this system, the first and second tracks of the four tracks are used for forward, and the third and fourth tracks are used for reverse. By simplifying the mechanism, durability is greatly improved. In addition, since there is no misalignment of the head position (alignment) caused by wear of the mechanism, initial performance can be maintained for a long period of time.<br><br>The recording and playback head uses a hard permalloy head with high magnetic flux density and high abrasion resistance. Furthermore, the laminated type improves the high-frequency performance and enables recording with less distortion.<br>The two erasing heads, one for forward and the other for reverse, have a double-gap structure to achieve a strong erasing effect even for metal tapes.<br><br>In order to match the characteristics of each track of the head, the playback amplifier section uses four playback equalizer amplifiers that are specially tuned for each track. In particular, the first stage of in the first stage to prevent degradation of the quality of the music program.<br>A transistor-based electronic switch is used to select the four playback equalizer amplifiers and to switch between the recording amplifiers, providing durability not found in switches with mechanical structures.<br><br>The mechanism part is designed to be symmetrical, and the tape drive in both directions is made identical.<br>In this mechanism, the DC servo motor for the capstan always rotates two flywheels and capstan rotating in opposite directions to each other. The capstan for running the tape at a constant speed is designed so that one of the capstan always rotates without contact with the pinch roller. This, combined with the fixed head system, shortens the rise time until the tape is reversed and moves to constant speed, enabling quick reverse of approximately 0.16 seconds.<br><br>Silence is suppressed to less than 0.4 seconds when reversing the tape.<br>The tape reversal position is detected by an infrared tape sensor set opposite the forward erasing head. This detection position uses the back side of the area where the tape runs on the erasing head surface, so there is no malfunction even if a tape with a crease is used. The detection position optically accurately detects the boundary between the recording tape and the reader tape, ensuring reliable operation.<br><br>A microcomputer control system is used to drive the loading motor. The microcomputer quickly processes signals from an infrared sensor and directions of tape movement, and drives the loading motor for mode switching.<br>This motor performs track switching of a 4-track, 4-channel fixed head and crimping / releasing pinch rollers, thus minimizing unpleasant mechanical noise during tape reversal.<br><br>Equipped with a travel direction memory, the tape travel direction is memorized even when the power is turned off.<br><br>The basic mechanism of tape travel is a two motor drive system with separate capstan drive and reel drive.<br>The capstan uses a DC servo motor whose rotational speed is less affected by temperature changes in the mechanism, and the reel uses a DC motor.<br><br>Equipped with a non-slip reel drive mechanism, the tape tension on the take-up side is kept constant to prevent changes in tape running accuracy and uneven winding of the tape regardless of the amount of the tape wound.<br>Since the L series is a reverse machine, this mechanism is installed on both left and right sides.<br><br>Equipped with output level control for both headphone output and lineout.<br><br>Equipped with timer standby mechanism, it is possible to record the absence and play the alarm clock by using the timer sold separately.<br>When recording, the recording stops after one round recording, so that the recording on the opposite side is not deleted.<br><br>Equipped with VU meter and 3-point peak level indicator.<br><br>The Dolby System is installed as a noise reduction system.<br><br>Equipped with 3-step switching type Otre Tape Selector.<br>In the automatic mode, the detection mechanism operates to detect normal, chrome and metal tape types and automatically set the bias / equalizer. Some metal tapes without detection holes can be handled by the metal position switch.<br><br>Equipped with a microphone mixing function.<br>The microphone jack can be used as a center microphone when only the left channel is used.<br><br>The Auto-Rec Mute function is built-in. When you press the REC/MUTE switch, an approximately 4-second non-recording section is automatically created and the recording pause state is set. When you release the pause, recording starts, so you can edit the tape cleanly by repeating this operation.<br>If you press and hold this switch, it will be muted, and if you release it, it will be paused at that position.<br><br>By switching the tape direction switch, one way recording / playback, one round recording / playback, or endless playback can be selected.<br><br>A wired type remote control unit was sold separately as an option.</p>
