				<p class="detail">DAT deck with K2 interface.<br><br>It is equipped with a K2 interface that eliminates digital sound quality variation factors.<br>This circuit has a structure that reads only the code information from the transmitted digital signal contaminated by out-of-code components such as jitter (time-difference distortion) and ripple (waveform distortion), and creates a pure digital signal at another location.<br>In the XD-Z909, this K2 interface is installed just before the D/A converter to prevent the sound quality of the digital signal from changing.<br><br>It is equipped with newly developed AA (analog-accurate) converter.<br>The AA converter uses a 1-bit conversion method, replacing analog signals with pulse waves instead of bits, and directly converting the width of the waves into digital signals. This eliminates the need for precision in the direction of amplitude. Moreover, pulse waves that vary with time can be precisely controlled by a quartz clock, making it possible to perform digital conversion with excellent linearity.<br>Furthermore, in order to reduce the conversion error, it is passed through a fourth order noise shaper to shift the sampling distortion out of the band, and this data is passed through a 64 x digital filter to almost completely remove noise outside the audible band.<br><br>The D/A converter consists of an 18-bit digital bias D/A converter and an 18-bit active D/A converter. It uses an 8-times oversampling full-time 18-bit 4D/A converter.<br>In this D/A converter, 18 bits are always fully operated from Oire power to large input. In addition, there is no 0 cross distortion by the digital bias operation, and the non-linear distortion of the DAC is randomized, so that the sound quality in the auditory sense becomes natural.<br><br>Uses a fine tracking mechanism with a total weight of only 230g.<br>The rotary head with this mechanism uses a TSS head with excellent recording and playback characteristics and high abrasion resistance for the double-scan system. The ultra-compact capstan DD motor uses a plunger brake to shorten the search time. In addition, a 28 mm diameter flywheel and a tension control mechanism have been introduced to achieve precise operation.<br><br>A fully independent 5-block structure is adopted to eliminate mutual interference between each circuit.<br>Both the A/D and D/A converters, the mechanical part, the power supply part, the signal processing part and the display part such as the display are separated by the board or by adopting the shield structure, and the analog / digital circuit is separated by installing the twin configuration power transformer.<br><br>In consideration of the effect on sound quality, the signal transmission system is minimized and interference and vibration between fine parts and wires are eliminated thoroughly.<br><br>In order to reduce the adverse effects of vibration, a solid base with optimum damping characteristics and heavy weight is placed further below the chassis base, eliminating vibration from the outside and effectively absorbing vibration from the inside.<br><br>The wireless remote control is equipped with an FL display off function, which can turn off the FL display which is a source of digital noise.<br><br>It is equipped with a microphone jack, and the microphone amplifier is a full-fledged low-noise type with an attenuator.<br>In addition, it is a completely separate box design that is independently installed under the deck body.<br><br>The input / output terminal is equipped with one optical / coaxial system for the digital system, and one variable output terminal in addition to one fixed input / output terminal for the analog system. The volume can be adjusted by remote control.<br>The input can be switched by the selector on the front panel of the main unit.<br><br>It uses a start ID recording function that automatically reads the Q code information of the CD, and accurate heading information can be written.<br>In addition, manual rewriting can be easily performed by using Auto ID Edit, which searches the position where the start ID is written on a computer, and by using an independent subcode key.<br><br>Equipped with a digital mixing function, it can mix not only analog but also digital input signals.<br>You can also edit digital mixing by adding another DAT deck.<br><br>Equipped with a digital fade function.<br>The 5-second fade-in and 10-second fade-out functions are memorized in the computer, and one touch fade operation without failure is possible.<br><br>Equipped with a sampling monitor function, the digital input is also D/A converted before recording so that the sound quality and level can be checked in advance. In addition, the digital input is A/D / D/A converted and output even without a tape, so it can be used as an A/D / D/A converter.<br><br>Cassette tray can be opened / closed by remote control.<br><br>Equipped with a 20-dot digital meter with peak hold function.<br><br>Equipped with 10-key direct music selection function.<br><br>Equipped with blank search, skip, and end search functions.<br><br>Equipped with an intro-scan function.<br><br>It is equipped with a repeat playback function for all songs / one song.<br><br>It has a Queue &amp; Review function.<br><br>Equipped with P-time display function.<br><br>Compulink-1 / Synchro terminal is mounted.<br><br>Timer recording and playback are supported.<br><br>Equipped with a headphone port with volume.<br><br>Gold-plated input / output terminal is mounted.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
