				<p class="detail">A linear tracking player system equipped with an active trace servo system in addition to a biotracer.<br><br>Biotracer is used for the tone arm part.<br>In the biotracer, a speed sensor, a position sensor and a linear motor are installed on the vertical rotating part and horizontal driving part of the arm, respectively. The signals detected by the two sensors are sent to a servo amplifier, which supplies the necessary current to the linear motor to control the movement of the arm.<br>In addition, it is easy to follow the disk. It can reproduce slight warpage and eccentricity without any problem. In addition, we have succeeded in suppressing the low-frequency resonance peak to less than 3 dB regardless of the cartridge used. This makes it possible to bring out the original character of the cartridge. It also improves crosstalk.<br><br>Linear tracking system equipped with newly developed active trace servo is adopted.<br>Active Trace Servo is based on the major premise that the disk pitch always moves inward while varying variably. The motor for arm cross-feed is rotated in advance, and the change in pitch is read by the biotracer position detection sensor. When the pitch becomes coarse, the moving speed of the arm is increased, and when the pitch becomes fine, the moving speed of the arm is decreased. By this, the speed of the needle tip and the speed of the arm support are almost matched.<br>With this active and race servo, the arm can move continuously without stopping while slightly changing the moving speed. This eliminates the so-called wild chervil caterpillar movement and greatly reduces phase distortion caused by sudden movement of the arm support.<br><br>In order to eliminate the rattling of the arm support part which is a problem in the linear tracking system, the slide bearing by the mono-rail guide which matches the support shaft of the horizontal feed with the arm support point is used for stabilization, and the rattling is suppressed by the powerful damping force of the biotracer.<br>A linear BSL motor of the same system as the turntable is used for the motor for arm cross-feed.<br><br>The turntable motor uses a linear BSL motor that was developed based on the Nohha for the turntable for consumer players and cutting machines. There is no slot (groove) that causes torque unevenness, and the brush is removed for a simple structure.<br><br>The speed detection section of the servo circuit uses a Magne-disk speed detection method that employs precision measurement technology of the Sony Magne-scale. The multi-gap head detects 512 wave signals that are magnetized with high precision on the periphery of the turntable. This method enables servo compensation up to relatively high frequencies of flutter components.<br>In addition, in order to prevent the accurate servo from becoming ineffective due to the temperature characteristics of the element, we have adopted a quartz lock that controls the phase of the rotational frequency by utilizing the high oscillation accuracy of the crystal. This ensures stable rotational accuracy that is not affected by fluctuations in ambient temperature or power supply voltage.<br>When the rotation is stabilized, the Locked indicator on the front panel lights to indicate that the quartz lock has been performed.<br><br>The tone arm has a square pipe to increase rigidity and suppress natural vibration.<br>In addition, the shell connector is also devised, and the tip of the shell plug is held by strong force due to the wedge effect, and the base is tightened from four directions using a neck cylinder mechanism.<br><br>The SBMC has been adopted for the cabinet, which is less likely to resonate due to its larger internal loss than metal, can be machined with high precision, and has greater strength.<br>In addition, a large rubber cup filled with a gel-like high-viscosity elastic material is used for the insulator, and an acrylic dust cover, which is resistant to howling, is used for the dust cover, thereby suppressing vibration from the outside in both solid propagation and air propagation.<br><br>Equipped with auto 0 balance function, vertical speed sensor and linear motor replace counter weight to automatically take 0 balance.<br>In addition, since the needle pressure adjustment is an electronic needle pressure application method that makes use of the power of the linear motor, it can be controlled while the disk is being played back.<br><br>Almost all operations can be done with the front panel buttons except for replacing the disc.<br>In addition to the normal auto operation such as start / stop of performance, Oatley peat, and rotation number switching, the dedicated BSL motor enables the tone arm to feed left / right, needle tip up / down, and turntable start / stop operation.<br><br>If you press the FAST button at the same time as the left / right feed button of the arm, the moving speed will be increased.<br><br>The size is automatically detected by the optoelectronic disk size selector.<br>In addition, even if the start button is pressed without setting the disk, the needle tip does not move downward and returns as it is.<br><br>Equipped with muting circuit linked to up / down of tone arm.<br>It is always muting on when it is up, so you do not need to reduce the volume of the amplifier when you change the cartridge.<br><br>The separately sold synchronized remote control unit allows synchronized play with the cassette deck.</p>
