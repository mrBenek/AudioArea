				<p class="detail">DAT deck equipped with 2 ADC and 18-bit recording system.<br><br>The A/D converter uses a unique 2 ADC 18-bit recording system.<br>In this circuit, a small-level input signal is amplified by a factor of four, A/D converted by an A/D converter arranged independently on the left and right sides, and the output is reduced to 1/4 by digital operation. As a result, linearity in small-level signals is greatly improved and a high S / N ratio of over 94 dB is achieved.<br><br>The D/A conversion section uses a 4-DAC 18-bit conversion system.<br>This system uses a 4 dac configuration with two D/A converters for both the right and left channels, one for the positive signal side and the other for the negative signal side. Input digital signals are D/A converted individually, and only the high-linearity parts of each component are synthesized. In principle, 0 cross distortion, which interferes with the reproduction of small signals, is shut out. In addition, high resolution of 18 bits is obtained by high-precision control of the 4 dac processor, and together with the adoption of high-precision 4 x oversampling digital filter of the 266th order, the detail reproduction capability of music is improved.<br><br>The classAA method is applied to a total of eight locations, including sample-and-hold circuits, buffer amplifiers, and head amplifiers for recording and reproduction, thereby increasing the resolution in the middle and high range by accurate waveform transmission capability.<br>In addition, the power supply section is equipped with a unique active servo power supply regulation and low noise.<br><br>One optical and one coaxial input / output terminal is installed.<br><br>Three sampling frequency modes are available : 48 kHz recording / playback, 44.1 kHz playback, and 32 kHz recording / playback.<br><br>Equipped with an editing function, you can record or erase the start position (Start ID) and the start point of automatic skipping (Skip ID) on a recorded tape with dubbing as desired. In addition, the EDIT key for dubbing is equipped with. If you press the record / erase key for Start ID or Skip ID by mistake while the EDIT is off, the dubbing operation will not be entered and malfunctions will be prevented.<br><br>Equipped with auto mode, the start ID and number of songs can be recorded automatically when a silent part lasts for more than 2 seconds during recording.<br><br>Equipped with an unnecessary start ID automatic deletion function, it can be used for fine adjustment of the start ID recording position.<br><br>It is equipped with a high-speed renumbering function. With this function, when adding a music number to a newly recorded start ID, you can check the music number while driving at 100 times speed and correct only the part that should be corrected.<br><br>Equipped with 30-step program play function.<br>The unique CRV (Constant Relative Velocity) servo system realizes 200 x speed search, high precision program play and direct access.<br>In addition, the operability of the program reservation operation is improved by installing the continuous reservation key.<br><br>Equipped with a cleaning indicator.<br>If the rotary head becomes dirty, the cleaning indicator lights during playback and then flashes to request cleaning.<br><br>Timer recording is possible by using an optional timer.<br><br>On the display, you can see the total recording time (absolute), the recording time of each song on the tape (program), and the tape counter (counter).<br>It can also display the number of songs being played, the order of reservation, and the number of songs passed during search. It is also equipped with a digital response level meter of -60dB to 0 dB.<br><br>Equipped with an input switching key.<br>Select analog for normal recording, and digital for digital recording.<br><br>Equipped with the A-B repeat key, you can set any section and repeat playback up to 16 times.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.<br><br>You cannot copy digitally from a source that contains a CD player or copyguard.</p>
