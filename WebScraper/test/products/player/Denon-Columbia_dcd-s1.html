				<p class="detail">A CD player developed with DENON&#39;s technologies such as ALPHA processor and extra-thick sand-cast chassis.<br><br>It is equipped with an ALPHA processor which is a unique analog waveform reproduction technology.<br>Digital data recorded on CDs and other media is interpolated so that the sound is closer to the sound that existed in nature, and 16-bit data is reproduced at 20-bit quality.<br>Also, when recording music data with unnecessary bands cut off or test CD pulse data, or other CD with different recording methods, the filter functions as an adaptive digital filter (Automatic Low Pass filter Harmonic Adjustment) that automatically adjusts the cutoff band based on the input signal.<br>This circuit realizes the reduction of quantization distortion which is the destiny of digitization.<br><br>The D/A conversion part is equipped with Λ (lambda) S. L. C.<br>The D/A converter is equipped with DENON&#39;s original lambda processor, which in principle does not generate 0 cross distortion by arranging two ultra-high-precision 20-bit current addition type DACs differentially. By further improving the precision, it is possible to convert minute music information into high-purity signals.<br><br>The bottom chassis is made of sand casting with less stress and faster vibration damping than die-casting. The chassis frame is made of extruded aluminum with an average thickness of 6 mm on both sides, making it ideal for vibration damping.<br>In addition, the Oshige quantity and low center of gravity structure prevent resonance and adverse effects of propagation of specific frequencies.<br><br>The insulator is made of a composite material of sintered alloy and aluminum, which converts vibration into heat and eliminates the effect on sound quality.<br><br>The mechanism section has a top-loading structure, eliminating the tray section, which tends to cause vibration. The door opening is equipped with a special air shield to prevent air from entering, and the door is equipped with extruded aluminum material to shut out external light.<br><br>The pickup base is made of sand mold casting, and it has a double structure with oil damper and spring to absorb the swing back.<br>In addition, the mechanical plate supporting the pickup mechanism is also floating, and by using a 3-layer vibration isolation structure, adverse effects on sound quality are eliminated.<br><br>The transformer and pickup mechanism unit are located in the center, and the power supply, audio and digital parts are separated from each other on the circuit board to achieve an ideal weight balance.<br><br>We have developed and adopted a high-torque cogging less motor for the motor section of the turntable.<br>A ruby plate with high hardness and low friction coefficient is adopted for the shaft seat of the motor, and the precision of pit reading is improved with stable drive.<br><br>Uses a machined large diameter stabilizer that holds the entire surface of the disk.<br>By holding the entire surface of the disk, resonance is suppressed and jitter of the read signal is prevented, and the large inertia produced by the stabilizer acquires extremely stable rotation and improves the read jitter margin.<br><br>Linear motor drive is used for pickup drive.<br>The fine feed resolution of the pickup is improved by a linear motor drive that floats without contact and without using gears.<br><br>It is equipped with two systems coaxial with Tos-Link as digital input, and can also be used as a D/A converter.<br><br>Digital outputs include Tos-Link, BNC and balanced line (AES/EBU balanced transmission) XLR Route 3.<br><br>It is equipped with functions such as direct selection, program selection, repeat performance, manual search, automatic search and index search.<br>Wireless remote control is included.<br>With this remote control, you can select music, repeat music, search function, open / close air tight door, display dimmer, etc.</p>
