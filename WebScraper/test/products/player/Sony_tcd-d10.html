				<p class="detail">Digital audio / tape recorder &quot;Digital Denske&quot; was announced as a portable type of DAT deck.<br><br>While maintaining is reduced to B5 size while maintaining the quality.<br><br>It adopts the same 4D. D. motor mechanism as DTC-1000ES, and maintains high precision over a long period of time even under severe operating conditions, and acquires high reliability and durability.<br><br>A high SN ratio has been obtained by using a low-noise FET for the microphone amplifier.<br>In addition, to expand the dynamic range, the first stage of the microphone amplifier uses a power supply that is boosted to ± 15 v.<br><br>Although it looks like 2 lines on the outside, it uses 4 lines independent volume with separate line input and microphone input on the circuit.<br>We have also adopted an NF-type attenuator that minimizes the deterioration of the SN ratio.<br><br>Recording characteristics are improved by applying pre-emphasis.<br><br>The A/D converter uses a 16-bit double integration type that has been used in professional PCM equipment.<br><br>Start ID up to 99 points can be recorded automatically (always at the start of recording) or manually (at any point during recording). Also, during playback, scan search allows recording confirmation for approximately 10 seconds from each start ID.<br><br>You can use the built-in clock to record the recorded time in real time. The recorded time is the year, month, day, day of week, hour, minute and second, and can be called up on the display during playback.<br>This function is only available for self-recording on TCD-D10.<br><br>It is equipped with a 2-speed Cue &amp; Review function that plays normally for about 5 seconds at first and fast-forwards after that.<br><br>In addition to the recorded time, it is equipped with the liquid crystal display which can display recording elapsed time, remaining time of the tape and remaining battery warning.<br><br>Equipped with a limiter function to prevent distortion caused by unexpected large input.<br>It also has a 20 dB attenuator that prevents the microphone amplifier from being saturated by a loud source.<br><br>It is equipped with a monaural monitor speaker that can confirm the recorded contents.<br><br>Equipped with a hold switch to hold recording and regenerating condition even in heavy motion.<br><br>By placing the main switch on the top panel, indoor usability is also taken into consideration.<br><br>It comes with a pointing angle variable MS type one point microphone that utilizes the know-how of professional machines.<br><br>Comes with a wired remote controller that can be used as a microphone grip.<br><br>Carrying case / belt is included.<br><br>Even in places where there is no home power supply, the attached rechargeable battery allows recording for about 2 hours continuously.<br>This rechargeable battery is fully charged in 1.5 hours using the included AC adapter and battery charge adapter.<br><br>With accessories sold separately, it can be driven by car battery.</p>
