				<p class="detail">A three head cassette deck developed using the technology used in the TD-V931.<br><br>It employs an arc base that combines a mechanism with a chassis base made of a high-density compression-molded board made of coniferous trees. By equivalently increasing the total weight of the mechanism, vibration during mechanical operation is attenuated.<br>Delicate sound quality parts are directly mounted on this arc base to eliminate resonance. In addition, the recording section, playback section, power supply section, bias oscillation section, and input circuit section are structured by block to eliminate mutual interference. The digital operation section is integrated in one place to prevent interference with the analog section, which has a subtle influence on sound quality.<br><br>The newly developed Airtight electric cassette door is used for the cassette door.<br>Compared with conventional cassette doors, this cassette door has a smaller window area to increase the weight. In addition, it is equipped with airtight rubber to increase the sealing degree with the main body. By opening and closing the cassette door electrically, the sound pressure from the speaker is cut off to prevent the mechanism from affecting parts and tapes.<br>In addition, vibration of the cassette half itself is suppressed by a half shell stabilizer to reduce acoustic modulation noise.<br><br>The head section uses an independent 3-head system, and the sound quality is improved by making appropriate adjustments to the recording and reproducing heads. In addition, the recording and reproducing heads use fine amorphous heads, and excellent head characteristics are achieved by adding the characteristics of an SA (Senalloy) head with good magnetic characteristics and long life to the amorphous head with excellent high-frequency characteristics.<br>In addition, PC-OCC (single-crystal high-purity oxygen-free copper material), which greatly reduces signal loss, is used for the coil winding and lead wire of the head to improve sound quality.<br><br>High-precision DC motors for the capstan, reel capstan, reel, and mechanism drive. In addition, the capstan uses a closed-loop dual capstan system with a twin belt drive system that provides a stable driving force by using two belts.<br>In addition, aluminum die-cast has been adopted for the mechanism base, greatly improving the positional accuracy of main parts related to mechanical running.<br><br>Equipped with Dolby B/C NR as a noise reduction system.<br>It is also equipped with the Dolby HX-PRO, and achieves flat frequency characteristics by recording with the bias variable according to changes in the music signal.<br><br>Equipped with an NR defeat circuit, the noise reduction can be removed from the signal circuit by switching the switch to eliminate the influence of the circuit.<br><br>Equipped with two direct input jacks, you can record music signals from digital sources with higher purity.<br><br>The using a remote bar for the input selector and controlling it close to the input terminal, noise in the signal path is prevented.<br><br>The audio circuit uses a DC amplifier configuration for both recording and playback systems, and phase characteristics, distortion factor and linearity are improved by eliminating capacitors as much as possible.<br>In addition, in order to protect music signals that are easily affected by other circuits from interference of bias frequency, a high bias method (210 kHz) is adopted for the recording amplifier section.<br><br>Two separate displays for a mechanical counter and a level display are used to improve visibility and operability.<br>In addition, to eliminate the influence of digital noise from the FL, the FL display can be turned off during recording and playback. Even when the display is off, it turns on during operations such as stop, fast forward, rewind, and pause, and turns off automatically when recording or playback starts.<br><br>For checking the recording status, you can confirm the level at which the maximum peak can be called up with a number.<br><br>It is equipped with an auto monitor function that automatically switches and outputs the sound of the tape immediately after recording during recording and the sound of the source during pause standby.<br><br>Equipped with an automatic music selection function.<br><br>Uses OFC thick power cord with polarity display and gold-plated input / output terminal.<br><br>Equipped with REC calibration (level bias) function.<br><br>Equipped with a timer start mechanism, and by connecting an optional timer, it is possible to record absence and play an alarm clock.<br><br>Equipped with a headphone port with volume.<br><br>Equipped with synchronous terminal.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
