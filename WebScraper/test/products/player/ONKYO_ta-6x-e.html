				<p class="detail">A stereo cassette deck equipped with a newly developed real-time counter.<br><br>We have developed and installed a dual-sensor real-time counter that detects the rotational speed not only from the delivery reel but also from the take-up reel and calculates the remaining time using a computer based on both rotational speeds. This prevents in principle the influence of tape thickness depending on brand and grade, and improves time detection accuracy.<br>Since the remaining time is displayed within a few seconds from any position during a performance, it is also effective when recording is started with a tape in the middle of winding. The remaining time display continues during fast forward and rewind as well as during play travel. Even while the time display continues, you can obtain more accurate remaining time by checking again with one push when you want to know.<br>There are 3 types of remaining amount display switches, C-46, C-60 and C-90. In addition, pressing 46 and 60 is compatible with C-50, pressing 60 and 90 is compatible with C-80, and pressing 46 and 90 is compatible with C-120 tapes.<br>In addition, you can enjoy Memory Stop and Memory Play using the counter 0 : 00 position in conjunction with the memory switch and rewind.<br><br>Equipped with Auto Space Rec Mute which is convenient for cutting CM and editing tape during recording.<br>If you press this switch during recording, a non-recording portion is automatically created for approximately five seconds, and recording waits with REC-PAUSE.<br><br>The tape drive section is a 3-motor silent mechanism equipped with a brushless FG servo DD motor with excellent rotational performance and stability for capstan drive, and a dedicated DC high torque motor for reel drive and head base drive.<br><br>The head is equipped with a special hard permalloy head with a hard guard that uses permalloy as a basic magnetic material and has improved performance such as head touch, abrasion resistance, and saturation magnetic flux density.<br>By improving the head touch by making the shape into a hyperbolic type, the contour effect is reduced and the flat characteristic over the whole circumference fractional band is obtained.<br>As for durability, a hard layer called Mohs scale 8.5 is specially deposited on the surface of permalloy to guard the core to ensure excellent abrasion resistance. In addition, parts without a core are also protected with metal of the same hardness as the core to prevent uneven wear of the core.<br><br>In addition to the Dolby B type which is well known for its effect of reducing tape hissing, it is equipped with the Dolby C type.<br>The Dolby C type not only realizes an excellent noise reduction effect, but also solves the breathing phenomenon using the sliding band method and improves the high-frequency saturation level using the anti saturation method.<br><br>Equipped with an accu-bias control, you can control the bias value to the optimum value according to the characteristics of the tape.<br><br>Equipped with a 2-color 12-segment LED peak digital bellmeter with excellent responsiveness.<br><br>Equipped with timer standby mechanism that is useful for voice recording and alarm clock playback.<br><br>Equipped with a full auto-stop mechanism so as not to burden the mechanism and tape.</p>
