				<p class="detail">CD player with 8 times over sampling and 18 bit high bit system.<br><br>The digital filter is equipped with an 8 fsx 18-bit digital filter. The digital filter has 225 + 41 + 21 orders of operation order and achieves 8 times oversampling by high-precision digital operation.<br>By raising the sampling frequency of CD from 44.1 kHz to 352.8 kHz, which is eight times higher than that of CD, this digital filter shifts sampling noise, which adversely affects audio signals, to a higher frequency range. Furthermore, the digital filter itself has characteristics of -100dB or less for out-of-band noise and ± 0.0001 dB or less for in-band ripple. Both digital filters have achieved high performance of 16 bit resolution or less. This reduces the occurrence of pre-echo and post-echo, which affect sound quality.<br><br>The D/A converter uses an 18-bit left / right independent twin D/A converter.<br>In order to eliminate quantization errors, this D/A converter receives the 18-bit output of a digital filter and performs D/A conversion with a resolution four times higher than that of conventional D/A converters. This realizes more faithful D/A conversion the minute signal level where the number of bits decreases.<br><br>There are two types of audio outputs : filtered through a low-pass filter and direct without a low-pass filter.<br><br>The feed of the optical pickup is equipped with a unique high-speed access linear motor for quick music selection playback.<br>In addition, to prevent unwanted vibrations from being transmitted to the optical pickup, the mechanical unit uses a heavyweight BMC as the base material to suppress resonance.<br><br>The servo circuit is equipped with a 2-way computer servo, which automatically switches between fast and slow response to reduce disturbance in digital signal processing and improve tracing capability.<br><br>In order to eliminate interference caused by electrical and mechanical vibration between the digital servo, audio and power supply sections, we have adopted a separate sheet configuration in which each circuit is composed of independent boards. In addition, the audio sheet is equipped with a copper-plated VM stabilizer that covers the entire audio circuit section from the lower part of the sheet and suppresses vibration.<br><br>The audio output circuit consists of two stages, a V/I conversion amplifier and an I/V conversion amplifier V conversion amplifier. This allows the audio signal to transmit current and prevents digital noise.<br><br>The power supply to the digital servo section and audio section consists of a large 2-transformer power supply with an independent shield case.<br>In addition, the power supply circuits for the D/A converter section and the audio section employ a shunt regulator system with independent A-class operation to supply power with low noise and low impedance.<br><br>The front, top, and side of the cabinet are made of highly rigid extruded aluminum materials, and the bottom plate is made of a heavy bottom cover to eliminate cabinet noise.<br>In addition, a 4-piece heavy insulator composed of sintered alloy, rubber vibration isolator, felt, and aluminum cover is used for the leg part.<br><br>It is equipped with two digital outputs which are coaxial with the optical system.<br><br>0.4 dB step digital volume is mounted.<br>This volume has a dynamic range of 120 dB by 20-bit operation.<br><br>Equipped with 2 speed monitor search, it is possible to fast forward and fast backward while playing. With this function, it is slow at first, and if you keep pressing it, it becomes fast.<br><br>Equipped with an index search.<br><br>One touch direct music selection is possible with 10 keys on the main unit or 24 keys on the remote control.<br><br>Equipped with 3-mode program function of manual, delete and random.<br><br>Equipped with 4-mode repeat function between 1 song / all songs / program / A and B.<br><br>Equipped with a space insert function, you can set a silent space of approximately 3 seconds between songs.<br><br>Alarm clock regeneration is possible by combining with an external timer.<br><br>Equipped with 24 songs music calendar.<br><br>Equipped with FL display, track No, index No and performance elapsed time can be displayed independently.<br>It also has an optical head position function that displays the position of the optical head as a percentage, and a volume level display that allows you to check the output level.<br><br>It comes with a full 44-key remote control that allows you to perform almost all operations from tray open / close, program settings, volume adjustment, etc.</p>
