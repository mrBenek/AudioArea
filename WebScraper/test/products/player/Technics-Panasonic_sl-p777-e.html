				<p class="detail">CD player with 8 sample linear interpolation in addition to 4 dac linear 18-bit conversion system and class AA.<br><br>A 4DAC linear 18-bit system is used for the D/A converter.<br>This circuit employs a 4 dac configuration in which a D/A converter for the positive signal and a D/A converter for the negative signal are mounted on each of Lch and Rch. Each component is individually D/A converted and synthesized by a newly developed 4 dac control LSI, eliminating the generation of 0 cross distortion in principle. In addition, the S/N ratio of 112 dB or more is ensured by canceling out common-mode noise, greatly improving the reproducibility of small signals.<br><br>The digital filter that removes unwanted high-frequency components from the input signal from the CD employs a high-precision four times oversampling digital filter, which provides twice the time resolution of the conventional 16-bit two times oversampling output waveform.<br><br>It is equipped with an 8-sample linear interpolation circuit. When a data error occurs due to scratches or dirt on the disk signal surface, if the number of data errors is up to 8 in succession, the signal does not shift to the previous value hold and the linear interpolation prevents noise generation.<br><br>A classAA system unique to Technics is adopted for the buffer amplifier and headphone amplifier.<br>In classAA, voltage control and current drive, which used to be performed by one amplifier, are shared by two different amplifiers. This enables faithful waveform transmission that is less affected by the load, and realizes low distortion and high resolution in the middle and high range.<br><br>Equipped with an optical digital output terminal and a digital output ON/OFF switch on the front panel.<br><br>High-quality audio parts are used to further improve sound quality.<br>The rectifier circuit uses a fast recovery diode and a high-capacity audio electrolytic capacitor to reduce rectification noise. The resistor uses a newly developed high-sound carbon film resistor with a non-magnetic cap, and the capacitor uses a high-sound electrolytic capacitor to enhance musical performance by adding a low-distortion and transparency.<br><br>In order to reduce floor vibration transmitted from the installation platform, four large insulators and a multi-insulator structure consisting of a double floating optical deck are adopted, which realizes large vibration damping.<br>A multi-layered base made of different materials, such as metal chassis and TNRC (Technics Non-Resonance Compound), provides a high vibration damping effect against sound pressure vibration transmitted from speakers.<br><br>The Edit Guide function automatically calculates and displays on the display the number of songs, number of songs and remaining time that can be recorded on the A side and B side of the tape by simply selecting the length of the tape to be used (90 minutes, 60 minutes or 46 minutes). You can set the length of the tape to be recorded from 1 to 99 minutes.<br>It is also equipped with a disk link function, enabling efficient recording and editing from two or more disks to a single tape.<br><br>It is equipped with an auto-peak search function that automatically detects the peak level of all songs on the disc or program songs, and then repeats playback for approximately 3 seconds before and after the peak point, for a total of approximately 6 seconds. This function allows you to easily set the recording level at the deck.<br>In addition, the SL-P777 is equipped with AB Peak Search, which enables high-precision peak search of any two points (A-B) in play state.<br><br>Equipped with shuttle search, it is possible to search from 1/8 times speed to 76 times speed by the angle of the dial in 4 stages each in forward and reverse directions.<br><br>It is equipped with a window repeat function so that it can be played repeatedly while producing the phrase sound of the pause position in the pause state.<br>You can choose between narrow (approximately 0.2 seconds) and wide (approximately 1 second) playback duration.<br><br>Equipped with an Lch/Rch independent digital level meter and a display that can display the playing position by switching.<br><br>20 keys are used for both the main body and remote control, and direct access is possible.<br><br>A unique high-speed linear access system using a linear motor is adopted for the traverse mechanism that moves the pickup to realize high-speed access.<br><br>Equipped with 2 mode timer play function of normal and random.<br><br>Equipped with headphone volume.<br><br>Equipped with auto queue, 1 song / all songs / program songs / repeat between A and B, and 32-step program memory.<br><br>Equipped with 4-mode time display function.<br><br>Equipped with a display ON/OFF function.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
