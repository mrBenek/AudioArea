				<p class="detail">3-head &amp; DD series cassette deck.<br><br>The mechanism part uses a double servo quartz lock DD motor.<br>This motor uses a Hall element developed at Victor Central R &amp; D Center for polarity switching to realize a brushless structure that eliminates mechanical contacts. In addition, by removing the core and slot, rotating irregularities such as cocking and noise are eliminated, making it possible to achieve smaller size and higher performance.<br>FG servo is used for the servo circuit, and detection error is suppressed even if positional deviation occurs by the all-around integration type of 204 pole 102 pulse. In addition, in order to prevent positional deviation, the FG magnet is coaxial with the capstan, and it is magnetized after holding the center.<br>The double servo quartz control circuit uses a control method that increases the stability of the quartz by a factor of 10. The rise of the quartz is checked by FG, the quartz is driven to a constant speed, and then the double servo quartz control is applied. This makes the rise of the quartz itself smooth, and the Quartz Lock indicator lights when the quartz lock is engaged.<br>In addition, in order to prevent the rotational accuracy from being affected by temperature changes and variations in parts, a newly developed multi-pride bridge drive circuit is adopted to improve wow and flutter. In addition, a composite material effective against modulation noise is adopted for the flywheels to eliminate flutter components caused by squeal (vibration) and cloudiness in the high-frequency range.<br><br>The mechanism part of the 3-head &amp; DD series has been further improved for the 3-head.<br>In the conventional 3-head system, tension was applied by sandwiching the tape between an erasing head and a pad. However, in the new mechanism, the structure of the mechanism itself has been reconsidered and the tension pad has been eliminated by improving the accuracy. This eliminates the driving instability caused by friction and reduces modulation noise.<br>In addition, the operation feeling is improved by suppressing mechanical operation sound as much as possible despite the solenoid operation with good start-up. In addition, as many as six utility models have been adopted around the door, and the cassette half is firmly fixed by minimizing play (play), which has a positive effect on running performance.<br><br>Equipped with a tension-stabilizing loop system that applies eddy current (eddy current).<br>In this system, a disk that rotates in synchronization with the take-up reel is set to face the flat disk magnet attached to the supply side reel. Since the direction of rotation of the magnet and disk is opposite, eddy current is generated between them and tension works. This reduces the difference in tension between the beginning and end of winding and ensures stable running performance.<br><br>Equipped with a B / E / S tuning system.<br>This circuit uses a microcomputer to tune the B (bias), E (equalizer) and S (シンシティビティ) for each tape to achieve a recording condition close to the ideal.<br>For the B, E, and S tuning, when you press the Start button, the computer starts the bias adjustment operation and searches out the average of 16 steps for the left and right sides. The equalizer is divided into 16 steps for the high frequency (12.5 kHz) and 8 steps for the middle frequency (4 kHz). The high frequency is recorded three times, averaged, and the left and right sides are set independently. Sensitivity compensation is also averaged for the left and right sides.<br>All the above operations are performed in about 30 seconds. When tuning is completed, the tape is automatically rewound to the start position.<br><br>Equipped with Dolby C NR and ANRS (Dolby B NR) as noise reduction systems.<br>The Dolby C uses a 2-stage sliding band system, which changes the frequency of compression and expansion according to the signal level. The sliding band is effective in reducing bleeding and has excellent S / N ratio and transient characteristics when there is a signal.<br>The noise reduction band is wider than in the past over the middle and high frequency band to obtain a high noise reduction effect. It also has a function to improve the high-frequency linearity to further improve the high-frequency characteristics.<br>In addition, by adopting the newly developed Dolby C standard IC, operation is more stable and reliability is improved.<br>The DD-99 has a built-in MPX filter to prevent malfunction.<br><br>It uses a combination head that uses an X-cut Sen-Alloy head for the playback head and a Sen-Alloy head for the recording head. By adopting a 3-head configuration that provides the optimum gap width for each head, it enables recording and playback with higher fidelity.<br>The Sen-Alloy Head has a unique composite structure in which a Sen-Alloy Chip is bonded at high temperature to the tape sliding surface of a Permalloy 6-layer laminate core. It has many advantages in terms of core loss, gap accuracy, wear resistance, and corrosion resistance. In addition, since the maximum magnetic flux density is high, it is compatible with the superior high-frequency characteristics of metal tapes. The X-cut Sen-Alloy Head has a special shape processing of the Sendust chip to improve the low-frequency waviness (contour effect) in response to the high-frequency expansion.<br><br>The erasing head uses a 2-gap Sen-alloy head.<br><br>In order to prevent misalignment and head touch, the head slide base is made of 4-point zinc die-cast, which is strong against twisting and deformation. In addition, the development of a non-contact back tension system provides further stability and dramatically improves changes over time.<br><br>The amplifier circuit employs a DC configuration amplifier that reduces the number of capacitors in the signal system. This reduces distortion, noise, and phase change caused by the capacitors, and improves transient characteristics. The head amplifier is a direct coupling with a double differential amplifier. The microphone amplifier, recording amplifier, and ANRS/Dolby NR circuit are also DC amplifier configuration with ± 2 power supply. Therefore, all amplifiers that pass audio signals are DC configuration.<br>In addition, the power supply circuit has improved its performance by increasing the accuracy of the error detection circuit, resulting in a stable circuit with less ripple.<br><br>Full logic control is adopted.<br><br>Equipped with a dot matrix 2-color FL18 segment digital peak meter capable of switching between peak and VU.<br>Comes with peak hold.<br><br>Equipped with 4-digit FL electronic counter.<br>This counter uses a Hall element to detect the magnetic change of the magnet that is directly connected to the take-up reel and displays the FL. In addition, it has a built-in 2-point memory mechanism and can be used with the auto-rewind mechanism to repeat playback of any 2-turn.<br>This counter can also be used as a stopwatch by switching the switch.<br><br>Equipped with a music scan (automatic cue) function.<br><br>Equipped with memory auto-rewind mechanism.<br><br>It has a headphone linked playback volume.<br><br>Equipped with a timer standby mechanism and by connecting an optional timer, it is possible to record the absence and play the alarm clock.<br><br>Equipped with remote control terminal.</p>
