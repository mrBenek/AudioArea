				<p class="detail">ES series CD player equipped with newly developed pulse 8D/A converter.<br><br>The D/A converter consists of a high-density linear converter system, a 45-bit noise-shaping digital filter and a pulse D/A converter.<br><br>The Pulse D/A converter consists of a current source and an electronic switch. It expresses music waveform by switching two values of 0 and 1 at high speed. By this, the amplitude level is always constant and changes only in the time axis direction. The PLM (Pulse Length Modulation) wave is output. By passing it through a low-pass filter, unwanted high-frequency noise outside the audio band is removed and music waveform is obtained.<br>To reduce quantization noise in the audible band up to 20 kHz, the pulse D/A converter is equipped with a multi-stage noise shaping operation that employs 64 times oversampling and the Sony Extended Noise Shaping method. Oversampling reduces quantization noise in the audible band by increasing the sampling frequency. Noise shaping reduces quantization noise in the audible band by feeding back the requantization error to the input side when the number of bits is reduced. These technologies ensure a high dynamic range.<br>The pulse D/A converter operates at 45 mega pulses per second, and it completely eliminates differential non-linear distortion, glitch, and 0 cross distortion, which were difficult with conventional methods.<br><br>The newly developed pulse D/A converter has a 4D/A output that outputs positive-phase, negative-phase, and each LR signal.<br>The ES Series is equipped with two pulse D/A converters in the complimentary service mode, in which two pulse D/A converters are used to produce 8D/A outputs. In the complimentary service mode, two pulse D/A converters are modulated and differentially synthesized so that they are complementary to each other. This mode has the effect of canceling harmonic distortion and improves the distortion factor. In addition, the SN ratio is improved by doubling the output current value.<br><br>To take advantage of the pulse D/A converter, the high-density linear converter system is equipped with a 45-bit noise-shaping digital filter in the front stage.<br>This circuit achieves a high dynamic range by performing a highly accurate oversampling operation and a first order noise-shaping operation on the operation result.<br><br>A direct digital sink is included to eliminate jittering issues.<br>In this system, the master clock is formed on the same chip as the pulse D/A converter, and jitter is eliminated in principle by eliminating jitter immediately before the electronic switch, which is the final stage of the pulse D/A converter.<br><br>The analog low-pass filter is a GIC type low-pass filter in which passive elements such as capacitors and coils are not connected in series. In addition, the CDP-X777ES is equipped with a line amplifier of a discrete configuration using a low-noise FET. It is composed of two input stages of FET input and differential and an output stage of A-class operation. The high-impedance input characteristic of the FET makes it possible to completely separate the noise component of the low-pass filter at the front stage.<br><br>Low noise and high stability are achieved by incorporating an RF amplifier in the pickup section.<br><br>The digital signal processing LSI uses the fourth generation LSI for the Sony CD player. Previously external RAM has been upgraded to a capacity of 32 kbit and built into the digital signal processing LSI. The precision of the signal processing capability is further enhanced by adopting the strict 6-fold error correction method.<br><br>The drive circuit of the optical pickup uses a newly designed fine drive.<br>This circuit uses a balanced push-pull drive circuit with ± 2 power supply system instead of a single-drive circuit with one side ground in the past. This circuit is separated from the earth by using a balanced push-pull drive circuit with ± 2 power supply system. This eliminates noise current from entering the power supply line and realizes a cleaner optical pickup drive.<br><br>The servo circuit is equipped with the S Servo III, which works on out-of-band noise, and the Advanced TS Servo, which works within the servo band.<br>In the S Servo III, the high-frequency noise component of the servo current is removed with a low-pass filter to supply a smooth servo current, which stabilizes the power supply from the power supply and prevents adverse effects on sound quality.<br>The Advanced TS Servo reduces the current that is unnecessary for servo operation by nearly 10 dB. In addition, the actuator of the optical pickup is equipped with a newly developed optical pickup to further improve the quietness of the optical system.<br><br>A digital CLV servo is installed in the drive system servo circuit that controls disk rotation.<br>The digital CLV servo detects the rotation of the spindle motor and controls it with 10-bit resolution to maintain an accurate linear velocity regardless of the disk&#39;s inner or outer circumference. It also detects the difference in inertial mass between the 12 cm CD and 8 cm CD disks to drive more appropriately.<br><br>An aluminum die-cast base unit is used for the base of the optical mechanism.<br>By adopting aluminum die-cast with low resonance mode and high accuracy and machining accuracy, and by adopting floating structure with double suspension containing high viscoelasticity gel, external vibration is completely eliminated.<br><br>An acoustic shield is mounted on the opening of the front panel where the tray is stored, and a damper made of special rubber material is installed to improve airtightness and reduce the effect of air vibration entering the chassis.<br>The tray itself uses a high-rigidity G tray made of the same material as the G base unit to prevent unwanted vibrations from being transmitted to the disk.<br><br>The FB chassis is used for the chassis structure, and the whole chassis is firmly joined by the frame surrounding the outer circumference and the beams passing through the front and rear front and rear to realize a structure resistant to vibration.<br>In addition, the CDP-X777ES uses a copper plating inside the chassis and a high-rigidity aluminum top plate to make the chassis nonmagnetic, thereby eliminating the occurrence of magnetic distortion.<br>Uses fine ceramic insulators for the legs.<br><br>The power supply section is composed of two transformers, and the digital servo section and audio section are fed independently. In addition, a power supply circuit is provided for the D/A converter section to prevent interference from the power supply from the root. In addition, rubber dampers are used in four places to prevent vibration of the transformer from being transmitted.<br>The CDP-X777ES uses a heavy-weight transformer with a shield case. The entire transformer core is hardened with a hardened filler made of polybutadiene resin mixed with silica sand to reduce the noise of minute transformers.<br><br>Consideration is also been given to the circuit board structure, and interference from the digital part to the analog part is suppressed by the separate sheet structure which separates the digital circuit board and the audio circuit board.<br>We also use high-strength glass-epoxy ES substrates for digital circuits, power supply circuits, and audio circuits to prevent deterioration of sound quality caused by internal vibration and electrostatic floating capacitance.<br><br>Aluminum panel is used for the front panel, and side wood is equipped on the side.<br><br></p>

If you turn on Auto Space at this time, you can edit each song by adding a 3-second blank to the playing time. When you press the pause button, you can program the A side and then the B side together.<br><br>The manual fader allows you to fade in and fade out at the desired location.<br><br></p>

You can set up to 10 points per disc and fine-tune it in steps of approximately ± 0.15 seconds.<br><br>The program bank allows you to keep track of program performance settings.<br><br>In the last mode memory, you can store the play mode and fade time set just before removing a disc with a custom file. When the same disc is inserted, that mode is automatically recalled.<br><br>With File Recall, you can check what kind of file was stored.<br>This function can be function even if you don&#39;t have a disc installed, and you can delete unnecessary files on the fly.<br><br></p>
