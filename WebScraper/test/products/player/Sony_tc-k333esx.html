				<p class="detail">ES series cassette deck which inherited the design philosophy of TC-K555ESX.<br><br>Midship drive system is adopted to pursue ideal weight balance and rigid structure.<br>In the midship drive system, the mechanical deck and power supply unit, which account for a large proportion of the total weight of the deck, are located in the center of the chassis, and the operation control system and audio circuit are separated to the left and right sides, so that the weight balance is achieved with almost equal weight on the four legs.<br>In addition, the inside of the chassis is divided into almost three equal parts by a U-shaped inner chassis equipped with a mechanical deck and a power supply unit, which improves total rigidity and reduces mutual interference and resonance between each block.<br><br>In the audio circuit, the recording amplifier and the reproducing amplifier are arranged on an independent board and arranged in two upper and lower stages with a sufficient distance between them. Interference between the two amplifiers is suppressed. Interference between channels is also suppressed by using an all-stage L/R twin mono DC amplifier configuration.<br>In addition, the two blocks of the audio signal system, control signal system, and power supply system brain are completely electrically isolated.<br><br>The head uses an amorphous magnetic alloy for the core material and an LC-OFC wound laser amorphous head that uses LC-OFC for the head winding.<br>In addition, an independently suspended three head system has been adopted to achieve accurate azimuth accuracy and uniform head touch for both recording and playback heads.<br><br>The tape is sandwiched between two pairs of capstan heads and pinch rollers in a closed-loop dual capstan system. This improves wow and flutter characteristics, reduces modulation noise, and stabilizes head touch.<br>The capstan drive motor uses a 3-phase linear torque BSL motor for direct drive, and quartz lock servo for excellent driving characteristics.<br><br>It is equipped with a bias calibration function that can fine-tune the recording bias value within ± 20% and recording level calibration.<br><br>In addition to the counter 0.00, it is possible to perform a memory stop / play in which the operating point is the time when the memory button is pressed.<br>This memory point is retained even when the reset button is pressed, and can also be used as a marker to check the remaining time from the middle of the tape using the subtraction function of the linear electronic counter.<br><br>Equipped with newly developed Dolby NR B-C type IC.<br><br>Equipped with a wide-range peak program meter that simultaneously displays peak hold and real-time peak values.<br><br>Equipped with TypeI/II/IV auto tape selector.<br><br>Equipped with Rec Mute function with auto space.<br><br>Equipped with tape slack prevention function at cassette loading.<br><br>Equipped with an output variable headphone jack.<br><br>The timer (sold separately) allows continuous recording and playback.</p>
