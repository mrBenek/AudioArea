				<p class="detail">A cassette deck equipped with 2-motor system, HPF head, and Dolby NR circuit.<br><br>The mechanism uses a 2-motor system with a DC motor exclusively for quick winding and rewinding. This eliminates the need for a complicated transmission mechanism and allows the stable rotation of the dedicated capstan motor to be taken out as it is.<br>In addition, a flywheel with a large inertial mass is attached to the lower part of the capstan driven by the belt. Together with the mirror-finished capstan, the tape travel is further stabilized.<br><br>The head uses an HPF head with excellent high-frequency characteristics.<br>The HPF head is made of ferrite processed at high temperature and high pressure. In particular, the gap part is finished with high precision in the order of microns, so that recording / reproducing is possible up to 25 kHz at 19cm/s. Moreover, the head surface is finished with mirror surface, and the shield plate and core holder are made of HPF material with the same hardness, so that the estimated life of 200,000 hours is realized.<br><br>It is equipped with Dolby NR as a noise reduction system, and RS-676U is equipped with a level adjusting volume so that the level can be matched in recording and reproducing so that excellent reproduction is possible while maintaining the linearity of the signal.<br>In addition, an MPX filter switch is installed to enable accurate operation during FM recording.<br><br>The new time constant of 70 μ S has been adopted for the equalizer for chrome tape, which improves the SN ratio by 4.5 db compared to the conventional time constant.<br><br>Equipped with a tape selector with built-in chrome tape automatic detection mechanism.<br>When a chrome tape with a sensing recess is set, the bias circuit and bias current are automatically switched for the chrome tape. The tape selector can also be manually operated.<br><br>Since the line and microphone input are completely separated and sent to the amplifier, the SN ratio and linearity during line recording are improved.<br>There is also a position tuner and an OFF position for quick input switching.<br><br>An electromagnetic control using a plunger is adopted for the control button of the tape running, and it operates accurately by feather touch operation.<br>The internal lighting of the Play, Record and Pause buttons turns on during operation, making it easy to check the operation.<br><br>The Record button can be operated independently.<br><br>Pose lock is available.<br><br>The left and right independent volumes are eliminated, and the main volume and balance volume are used to control the volume.<br>The output volume is semi-fixed and mounted on the rear panel.<br><br>A constant voltage power supply is used for the power supply circuit to obtain stable operation and excellent linearity.<br>The oscillator circuit is driven differentially through a constant-voltage power supply to reduce distortion, and the circuit is sealed in a shield case to prevent beat with the tuner.<br><br>A high-gain low-noise transistor is used in the amplifier circuit, and together with the effect of the constant voltage power supply, the over-margin is 0 dB to + 20 dB.<br>In addition, a full-scale active filter is installed in the output stage to minimize the via Threec.<br><br>It is equipped with a newly developed level meter, which can perform peak check operation by switching the switch.<br>The pointer rises at -3dB (Normal-12dB) for a 10 mS signal. In addition, the meter uses 0 dB for an input with a magnetic flux density of 160nWb/m on the reference tape, making full use of the meter without fear of an instantaneous large input in peak check operation.<br><br>Equipped with a memory play mechanism.<br>In this function, the counter is set to 000 at any point and the switch is turned ON to play back. When it is rewound after that, it stops at the counter 999 position and the play operation starts automatically.<br><br>There was a wood case sold separately.</p>
