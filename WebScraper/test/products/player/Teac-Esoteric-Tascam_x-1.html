				<p class="detail">A high-end CD player developed by putting in various technologies and pursuing the essence as a pure music player.<br><br>The mechanism part uses the V. R. D.S. (Vibration-Free Rigid Disc-Clamping System) mechanism used in the Esotheric CD drive unit P-2.<br>The mechanism consists of a turntable with the same diameter and slightly tapered angle as the disk, and a clamper that is adjusted with high precision to crimp the disk. The clamper corrects the warpage and distortion of the disk and completely eliminates unnecessary vibration. In addition, the pickup that is adjusted to the same angle as the turntable makes it possible to always read a minute pit centered on the optical axis of the pickup.<br>Similar to the P-2, the X-1 uses a high-mass zinc die-cast turntable and clamper through a high-precision metaloid, greatly reducing the resonance frequency and vibration mode, and achieving high-quality sound quality.<br>A high-torque brushless Hall motor with a high magnetic flux density samarium-cobalt magnet is used for highly accurate rotational drive. Zinc die-cast is also used for the mechanical base and motor bearing bridge that support these mechanisms as a whole, providing high rigidity, rotational stability, durability, and high reliability.<br><br>The newly developed pickup balance drive system has been adopted for the pickup part to improve the drive capability, acquire pure earth potential, and thoroughly reduce noise.<br><br>The D/A converter is equipped with a distortion shaper ZDII, and the basic circuit is equivalent to D-2.<br>The Distortion Shaper ZDII is equipped with a dither method as a countermeasure against distortion caused by a small signal level of -60dB or less, which is inevitable for D/A, and conversion errors that occur when the signal changes slowly.<br>As a result, the conversion error of the D/A converter is dispersed and drastically reduced, and the extremely low distortion factor is achieved.<br>In addition, a high S/N ratio is obtained by using a unique high-frequency concentrated (high-pass) dither.<br><br>In order to further improve the principle of ZDII averaging, we have newly adopted a 1/16 shift (digital offset) small-signal oriented DAC that can eliminate MSB errors that normally occur near 0 V.<br>By shifting the 0 v operating point of the DAC by 1/16 of the full scale, the 0 cross distortion that occurs when the input code passes through 0 v is reduced to 1/8 compared with the conventional method. This improves the linearity in the signal region of -18dB or less where the music signal is concentrated.<br><br>The clock oscillation circuit uses a high-precision circuit with an average absolute frequency deviation within ± 50 ppm, enabling the reproduction of carrier purity, sign accuracy and time axis.<br><br>In the chassis structure, the V. R. D. S. mechanism is mounted at the center corresponding to the center of gravity of the body, and digital and analog boards are completely separated from each other on the left and right sides of the V. R. D. S. mechanism. Midship mounting method is adopted.<br>The optimum weight balance eliminates unnecessary vibration, and mutual interference between signal systems is completely eliminated.<br>These components are fixed in a highly rigid double chassis, making the structure resistant to internal resonance and external vibration.<br><br>The front panel is a high-density, high-density front panel that is pressurized with stainless steel and ceramic powder, and exhibits a shielding effect by weak conductivity in addition to a tremendous vibration control effect. It has an elegant design with an fcurve.<br>The center is equipped with a window with light up to watch the playing disc.<br><br>Balanced transmission is adopted for the main part including transmission between digital and analog. By transmitting not only positive-phase signals but also negative-phase signals simultaneously, noise contamination of the ground line is cancelled.<br><br>The power transformer employs a balanced winding that divides the windings are divided into two equal parts and opposite phases to each other to cancel the magnetic field and minimize electromagnetic noise. In addition, since the windings are arranged in parallel, both self-inductance and DC resistance are reduced and excellent regulation is obtained.<br>In addition, the positive and negative balanced power supply section is constructed with the positive and negative power supply and the negative power supply as independent windings to clarify the ground potential.<br><br>Originally developed audio-only parts were introduced, and non-inductive polypropylene condenser, PPS (polyphenylene sulfide) condenser, 25 bit arithmetic digital filter, ultra-low power consumption 80 mw relay, ultra-low distortion operational amplifier, etc. were adopted.<br><br>Equipped with a multi-functional remote controller, the brightness of the FL display can be adjusted in 3 levels of bright / dark / off by remote control.</p>
