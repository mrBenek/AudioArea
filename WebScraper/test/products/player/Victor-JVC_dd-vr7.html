				<p class="detail">3-head recorder / re-quick reverse deck adopting ceramic guard SA head.<br><br>Ceramic guard SA head is used for recording and re-recording head.<br>The Ceramic Guard SA head uses a non-magnetized ceramic guard that reduces the overall magnetization of the head, reduces the friction coefficient of the head surface, and reduces overall modulation noise.<br><br>The reverse mechanism uses a rotary head type Fine Axis Reverse System with a 3-layer die-cast structure.<br>This mechanism consists of a head mount base and a head holder for the rotating part. It uses a Jewel lock system to prevent distortion by pressing a ruby into the tip of the azimuth adjustment screw that receives the head holder. In addition, a stainless steel clamp plate is wound around the part of the head holder that is in contact with the ruby to improve abrasion resistance. The precision of all parts is on the order of 10 microns, and the die casting precision is ultra-precision processing.<br>The rotating part has been given molybdenum (baking) processing with good sliding and excellent temperature characteristics. There is no change in friction coefficient, smooth rotation can be ensured, and there is no play even in long-term use. In addition, we pursue accuracy by adopting a 2-point holding structure to minimize head tip fluctuation, and adopting a screw pitch of 1 / 2 of the normal screw pitch for azimuth adjustment and head height adjustment.<br>In addition, the head is not fixed directly to the head holder, but is inserted into the head clamp and press fit into the head holder. This allows not only independent azimuth adjustment in both forward and reverse directions but also head height adjustment. The relative position between the head and tape can be accurately determined in both directions. As a result, the frequency characteristics in both forward and reverse directions and the high-frequency characteristics that tend to fluctuate are maintained in automatic operation.<br><br>Flipping the tape from A to B is done by an infrared sensor embedded in the guide pin of the tape.<br>When the light emitted from the light-emitting device hits the splicing tape between the magnetic tape and the reader tape, the light-receiving device detects a change in the light and issues an inversion instruction, with a sound break of only 0.4 seconds.<br><br>The mechanism uses a 2-motor full logic and a silent mechanism with a mechanical drive motor. All modes are moved by detecting the position of the cam linked to the mechanical drive motor with a microcomputer.<br><br>A pulse servo DD motor is used for the capstan motor.<br>The servo circuit of this motor employs an FG servo that uses a frequency generator to detect rotation. The VICTOR/JVC method employs an all-around integration type of 160 poles and 80 pulses for this part, making detection errors difficult to occur even if positional deviation occurs. To prevent positional deviation, the FG magnet is coaxial with the capstan, and the magnet is magnetized after the center is held.<br>In addition, in order to prevent the rotational accuracy from decreasing due to temperature changes and variations in parts, the multi-pride bridge drive circuit absorbs these effects and improves wow flutter.<br><br>Equipped with auto REC mute.<br>When this function is pressed in the REC mode, a silent space of approximately 4 to 5 seconds is automatically set to the REC standby mode. In addition, Victor&#39;s unique circuit design allows for no recording from the stop mode.<br><br>It is equipped with an index scan, which allows you to scan the A and B sides one after another while playing the head part of the song for 10 seconds at a time.<br><br>It is equipped with a blank search so that you can look for blank areas on the tape.<br>If there is an unrecorded part for 12 seconds or more in the FF state, it is regarded as a blank, and it automatically returns to the end of the song, sends the blank part for about 4 seconds, and stops.<br><br>Equipped with 2 memory functions of STOP and PLAY, block repeat between 2 points is possible by using both STOP and PLAY memory in addition to the normal STOP memory and PLAY memory.<br>In combination with the reverse mode, block repeat across A and B faces is possible.<br><br>Equipped with a music scan.<br><br>Equipped with a 4-digital counter, it can be used as a function of direct reading of remaining time on the tape, 4-digit electronic counter, 20-song skip selection and stopwatch.<br>With the tape remaining time direct reading function, when the tape is reversed, the remaining time on the B side is displayed as soon as it becomes 0 at the end of the tape on the A side and enters the B side, and the minute display flickers when less than 3 minutes.<br>The 4-digit electronic counter is negative in the reverse direction so that the same number is displayed at the same position on the A side and the B side of the tape.<br>This is a 20-song jump function. You can select up to 20 songs from both A and B sides. When you select one song, you do not need to specify the number of songs, and you can search directly with the Music Scan button.<br>The stopwatch function is added across both A and B sides. The display time is automatically held when you stop or pause.<br><br>Equipped with an eject &amp; up mechanism that makes it easy to take in and out the cassette.<br><br>Equipped with 2-color FL peak meter capable of peak hold.<br>It is also equipped with a digital peak display function, which enables high-precision recording level setting by always digitally displaying the peak value of the signal.<br><br>Equipped with Dolby B/C NR as a noise reduction system.<br>The DD-VR9 is equipped with an MPX filter to prevent malfunctions.<br><br>Equipped with an auto tape select function.<br><br>Equipped with an output volume.<br><br>Equipped with timer standby mechanism with safety lock.<br><br>Remote control terminal is mounted.</p>
