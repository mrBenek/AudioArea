				<p class="detail">A compact disc player developed as an audio device that takes advantage of digital sources by adopting an enhanced D/A converter and an optimal servocontrol.<br><br>The D/A converter uses a 16-bit integration type D/A converter.<br>In this D/A converter, it is necessary to read data correctly in a certain amount of time. However, correct output cannot be obtained if the constant current value of the integrator is changed. Therefore, Trio has developed a constant current circuit for high-precision integration and supplies a stable current to the integration circuit of the D/A converter.<br>As a result, we have succeeded in reproducing audio signals that are faithful to digital signal data.<br><br>In order to improve the sound quality of the D/A converter and the analog section that follows it, we have invested the sound quality know-how obtained from Trio&#39;s amplifier and tuner technologies.<br>First, the digital signal processing section and the analog signal processing section each have independent power supply circuits to eliminate mutual interference and prevent unwanted signals from mixing into the audio output signal.<br>In addition, a high-precision analog switch IC dedicated for Lch and Rch is adopted for the conversion circuit to the RAM wave to improve separation and prevent sound from becoming muddy due to mutual interference.<br><br>The servocontrol which raises the tracing capability is equipped with the optimum servocontrol which detects the location of the scratch by dividing 1 lap into 120.<br>When a disc is damaged or dusty, it automatically detects it, controls the servo amount from before the damage, and returns to the original servo amount when the disc passes through the damaged area.<br>In addition, it automatically counts the error condition of the pickup, and controls the calculator that always calculates the pickup signal according to the condition, and always detects music information stably.<br><br>In the pickup section, a high-precision lens with less aberration is adopted as a collimating lens that converts the laser beam emitted from a semiconductor laser into a parallel beam and an objective lens that converges the laser beam and focuses it on the signal surface of the disk.<br>In addition, a multi-reflection critical angle detection method is employed for focus error detection, and a time difference detection method with a four division detector is employed for tracking error detection to obtain accurate servocontrol signals. Therefore, the laser beam is completely controlled by a high-precision focus / tracking adjustment mechanism of a two dimensional drive actuator system with excellent response characteristics, and the laser beam traces accurately on a row of minute pits.<br><br>Mechanism systems such as the rotary servo system and the pick-up feed mechanism are controlled by a computer to further increase the response speed of the music selection system.<br><br>It uses a large concentrated display that can check the operation status at a glance.<br><br>By using a high-precision mechanism system and a servocontrol, we have realized a multi-functional DPSS (Direct Program Search System) that can instantly start a song.<br><br>Up to 16 songs can be stored in the program memory with the music selection key operation of 0 ~ 9, while the performance order is freely set.<br><br>A remote control is included.<br><br>There are silver model and black model.</p>
