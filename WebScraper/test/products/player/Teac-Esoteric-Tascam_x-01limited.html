				<p class="detail">SACD/CD player upgraded from X-01.<br><br>The technology and know-how of the flagship models P-01 and D-01 developed by Esotherik are invested in the X-01Limited.<br>In addition, the 2 ch audio output terminal and digital output terminal realize 75 Ω transmission, and RCA Jack Nextgen from WBT, Germany, which covers a vast frequency band is adopted.<br><br><br>High-purity 6N copper cable is used for main internal wiring.<br>This high-purity 6N copper cable was jointly developed by Mitsubishi Cable Industries, Ltd. and Acro Japan, Inc., as well as Esoteric&#39;s MEXCEL interconnect and power cables, and is also used in the P-01/D-01.<br><br>We reviewed and upgraded the circuit configuration of the DAC section and analog output stage, and major components such as capacitors and resistors.<br><br>Uses WBT Nextgen&#39;s WBT 0210 cu RCA jack for audio output (L/R) and digital output.<br>In this terminal, the plate connected to the cold side has an open structure with one point contact. This structure eliminates adverse effects such as signal reflection and eddy current generation due to the closed structure of the surface contact surrounding the conventional plate. It also enables digital transmission with an impedance of 75 Ω in combination with a high-grade digital cable that guarantees 75 Ω, and suppresses signal attenuation due to impedance mismatch.<br><br>A gold plate marking X-01Limited is attached to the top panel.<br>This plate is only for X-01Limited, and it is not installed in the version up from X-01.<br><br><br>The mechanism section is equipped with a new VRDS mechanism.<br><br>The D/A converter uses PCM1704, a 24-bit D/A converter made by Bar-Brown.<br>By adding techniques such as current addition, each channel is composed of four chips at the time of 2 ch reproduction, and linearity is improved by addition of 2 dac output, and common-mode noise is suppressed by using this output in differential.<br>In addition, in order to realize high-precision D/A conversion by suppressing the generation of unnecessary jitter, a high-precision type crystal oscillator with ± 3 ppm precision is used for the crystal oscillator located inside the audio DAC substrate.<br>This DAC substrate uses a 4-layer substrate, and the left and right independent substrates reduce interference between channels.<br><br>A power transformer is installed exclusively for the D/A converter to eliminate noise from the mechanism and digital circuit.<br><br>The case has a 3-division structure with high rigidity and little interference between circuits, and a mechanism is placed in the center.<br>In addition, an ideal installation environment is constructed by supporting three points with a hardened copper pinpoint foot.<br>In addition, thick aluminum is used for the front panel, top plate, and side plate to eliminate the effect of vibration.<br><br>The high-end design features such as the illumination-style operation buttons that light up the surroundings, the front panel that accentuates the beauty of the short scratch finish, and the precise brand logo carved on the top plate.<br><br>Word Sync is supported, and master clock generator G-0s/G-0 (sold separately) can be connected.<br>In addition to supporting the 44.1 kHz system (up to 176.4 kHz), it is also possible to input the universal clock (100 kHz) unique to Etho-Telic. Quality is improved by placing the operation of the X-01 Limited under control of the ultra-high precision clock built into the G-0s/G-0.<br><br><br>There was a version upgrade service that provided an equivalent upgrade to the X-01.</p>
