				<p class="detail">A CD player with K2 interface and newly developed arc base.<br><br>The digital circuit has a K2 interface.<br>In this circuit, a detection circuit controlled by a precise master clock reads only the code information from the digital signal including the non-code component, and creates a completely identical new digital waveform on another block based on the information. This circuit completely shuts out the non-code component contained before passing through the K2 interface and suppresses current noise that cannot be removed by waveform shaping.<br><br>The D/A converter is equipped with a DD (Digital Direct) converter.<br>Unlike conventional ladder-type D/A converters, the DD converter converts digital signals into 1-bit pulse waves that vary based on the crystal clock and directly converts them into analog signals. Therefore, unlike conventional ladder-type D/A converters, the DD converter does not accumulate bits, so 0 cross distortion caused by amplitude errors does not occur in principle. This greatly enhances the ability to reproduce signals at minute levels. In addition, it realizes excellent characteristics such as a dynamic range of more than 100 dB and a distortion rate of less than 0.0017%.<br>The DD converter consists of three parts : a digital filter, a noise shaper, a PEM, and a DAC, all of which are digitally processed.<br><br>The chassis structure employs a newly developed arc base.<br>The arc base is made of a newly developed special resin with excellent vibration absorption, and has a new design of lattice-like ribs that completely suppress resonance.<br>The structure damping characteristics of the CD player as a whole are greatly improved by attaching the mechanism and circuit board directly to the chassis base steel plate and then attaching it to the base. In addition, in order to maintain the precision operation of the disk drive system, an insulator is placed between the arc base, mechanical base, and pickup base for flow training, and vibration is effectively eliminated by a three layer suspension structure combined with a special damper of a large insulated foot integrally molded with the arc base.<br><br>It uses a stabilizing wheel to improve rotational stability by equalizing the moment of inertia of the 12 cm disc and the 8 cm CD single, thereby suppressing changes in servo current and maintaining high sound quality at a high level.<br><br>Two FL displays are mounted on the display section, and the counter display is separated from the 20-track program chart and installed separately on the upper part of the tray. It is easier to see by function.<br>In addition, the display ON/OFF switch, which prevents microcomputer noise, can turn off either one of the positions that can be turned off during play, and the dimmer switch allows the display brightness to be adjusted to three levels.<br><br>Equipped with a 3-mode Triple A ditto system, you can edit various CDs.<br>In addition to distributing songs that fit within the specified time to the A/B side of the tape, it is equipped with auto-edit which can be automatically edited by one touch according to the order of songs by the microcomputer, program edit which can be selected according to your favorite order of songs, and multi-edit which can be programmed from many disks to make the best.<br><br>The volume uses a remote control electric volume linked to the headphone.<br><br>It is equipped with functions such as repeat (all songs / one song / program / A-B), 32 songs random program, 99 songs index search, introscan, autospace, timer play, etc.<br><br>Equipped with two digital output terminals that are coaxial with the optical system.<br><br>There are two analog outputs, fixed and variable.<br><br>Equipped with synchronous terminal.<br><br>In addition to the regular color, there was a gun-metallic color variation.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
