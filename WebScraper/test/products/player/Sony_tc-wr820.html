				<p class="detail">A cassette deck equipped with newly developed mechanism and sound auto-focus function.<br><br>It is equipped with a sound auto-focus function that detects the tape type and the presence of Dolby NR and automatically sets the appropriate recording level by the computer. The setting is done in the recording standby mode, but if there is an excessive input during recording, the volume is gradually reduced so as not to leave unnatural sound in the music. Furthermore, if the volume is set to 0 at the time of timer recording, a fade-in recording is automatically performed and the sound auto-focus function operates as soon as the recording starts.<br>By adopting a motor drive volume for the volume, the sound quality is equivalent to that of a manual machine.<br><br>The mechanism part is based on the mechanical deck TCM-200R which was launched in Shinkai for the reverse machine.<br>In addition, it is equipped with a cassette stabilizer, and when the tape is set by power loading, the holding arm secures the cassette half and suppresses harmful vibration during tape travel.<br><br>It uses power loading. If you put the tape in the cassette lid and press the operation button such as play or rewind without closing the door, the tape will be loaded automatically and enter the operation mode.<br><br>The head uses an LC-OFC wound laser amorphous head that takes advantage of the magnetic properties of amorphous magnetic alloys and employs an LC-OFC (linear crystalline oxygen-free copper) in the head winding of the original laser amorphous head. This reduces distortion due to capacitive reactances and reduces loss in the mid-range and high-range.<br><br>Equipped with the Dolby HX-PRO, the effective bias amount is controlled to the optimum value in 1/1000 second increments to prevent over-bias in the high-frequency range and improve linearity in the high-frequency range. This function works only during recording, so it is effective even when played on a deck without the Dolby HX-PRO.<br><br>Super-bias is adopted, and by shifting up the bias frequency greatly, the frequency difference with the music signal is expanded, and beat noise and intermodulation distortion due to interference between the bias frequency and the music signal are suppressed.<br><br>The B deck is equipped with a bias fine tuning function, and the bias value can be finely adjusted.<br><br>Equipped with Dolby NR B-C type.<br><br>By using the included wireless remote control, you can record in sync without connecting a sync cord to a CD player supported by Sony&#39;s remote control.<br><br>Equipped with FL tube adoption linear electronic counter with subtraction function of minute and second display.<br><br>It is equipped with a wide-range peak program meter that displays real-time peak values and also has a peak hold function.<br><br>Equipped with a display ON/OFF switch, three modes can be selected : all lights, counter only, and all lights.<br><br>Equipped with an auto-fader function, you can fade in or out from the position where you press the auto-fade button.<br>In addition, you can also fade in by recording messages in conjunction with the timer.<br><br>It is equipped with a quick Oatley birth function that realizes quick action with almost no sound cut when reversing the tape.<br><br>Equipped with AMS (Automatic Music Sensor) function that can quickly find the beginning of the previous or next music.<br><br>It is equipped with a blank skip function that fast-forwards to the beginning of the next song when there is a silent part of more than 10 seconds and restarts the performance.<br><br>It is equipped with an auto pause function. When dubbing at normal speed, the A deck waits for each song in a pause state and the B deck waits in a recording pause state. By using this function, you can dub while selecting songs.<br><br>Equipped with an auto tape selector that automatically detects whether the tape being used is type I (normal), II (high position), or IV (metal).<br><br>Equipped with an autoplay function that automatically starts playing after rewinding, and a memory play function that starts playing from the position reset to counter 0.<br><br>Timer recording and alarm clock playback are possible by combining the separately sold timer.<br><br>Equipped with a Rec Mute function with auto-space that automatically mutes for approximately 4 seconds.</p>
