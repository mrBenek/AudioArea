				<p class="detail">A record player with a flat roof and linear skating mechanism.<br><br>The linear skating mechanism developed in the TC-K88 is adopted. When the button on the front panel is pressed, the turntable body is pulled out to the front and record setting can be done smoothly.<br>It also has a flat roof style similar to that of cassette decks, amplifiers and tuners. This allows decks and amplifiers to be stacked and can be loaded up to 20 kg on the free upper part.<br><br>All operation of FL5 is done by front panel buttons, and smooth full auto is realized by microcomputer and exclusive motor for arm drive.<br>In addition, the FL5 is linked with a linear skating mechanism equipped with another dedicated motor to improve usability and safety.<br>When you set a record with the turntable main body pulled out and press the start button, the main body is automatically stored inside, then the turntable is started and the tone arm is led in.<br>In addition, if the eject operation is performed during a performance, the turntable body is pulled out while performing the same operation as the auto-cut operation.<br>Furthermore, if there is an obstacle in front of the turntable while the turntable is moving, or if a foreign object is caught between the turntable and the outer casing, the motor will reverse after stopping for approximately 15 seconds.<br><br>When playing with the turntable body pulled out, it operates as a complete manual machine.<br>Move the arm by hand and press the arm lifter button to start the turntable and lower the arm. Then press the arm lifter button to raise the arm.<br><br>The player automatically detects whether the set record is an LP or a doughnut, ensuring that you are led in at the beginning of the given first track. In addition, this autorecord size selector detects when the start button is pressed without placing a record, returns the arm and protects the needle tip.<br>The FL5 FL5 is equipped with a muting mechanism that eliminates shock noise when the needle tip touches or leaves the record, so you do not need to reduce the volume of the amplifier when changing cartridges.<br>In addition, the end detection mechanism that detects the end of play of the record is non-contact optical and protects the record and the needle tip without applying lateral pressure to the needle tip.<br><br>The rotating system uses a 3-stage block consisting of quartz lock servo, magne-disk speed detection, and linear BSL motor to obtain excellent characteristics.<br>In the quartz-locked servo system, the rotational speed is phase-controlled by utilizing the high oscillation accuracy of the crystal. This eliminates the instability of the servo system due to the temperature characteristics of the elements found in DC servo systems, and achieves stable rotational characteristics that are not affected by ambient temperature changes or power supply voltage fluctuations.<br>In addition, the speed detection mechanism adopts a magnedisk speed detection mechanism incorporating Sony Magnescale precision measurement technology. The multi-gap head detects the average value of the detection signal, which is densely magnetized around the turntable, and quickly detects minute changes in the rotational speed.<br>In addition, a linear BSL motor is used for the motor. The slot that caused cogging, which is said to be the destiny of a DC motor, is removed in principle. The brush is also eliminated to make the structure simple, and rotational accuracy, stability, and durability are improved.<br><br>Low mass and straight tone arm is used for the tone arm.<br>In addition, the cartridge is equipped with XL-20G MM type stereo cartridge as standard, and the cartridge can be replaced.<br><br>An overhang gauge is mounted on the back side of the turntable sheet.<br><br>By using the Synchronized Remote Control Unit RM-65 (sold separately), it is possible to play synchronized with Sony&#39;s remote control deck.</p>
