				<p class="detail">The Direct Drive Player System was developed with an emphasis on operability and durability while pursuing superior basic performance.<br><br>A direct drive system is adopted as the drive system.<br>In this system, the turntable is directly connected to the motor shaft, and there is no reduction mechanism such as belt or idler, so there is little unevenness in rotation and the motor itself rotates quietly at the same speed as the turntable.<br><br>DENON&#39;s proprietary high-precision magnetic recording method is used to detect the servo circuit speed.<br>In this system, the magnetic head detects pulses that are accurately recorded on the turntable inner circumference and converts them to voltages corresponding to their frequencies. This voltage is compared with a reference voltage to control the voltage applied to the motor. Pulses are recorded with an accuracy of 1,000 pulses and 0.01% wave-length errors. This enables extremely accurate speed detection, extremely fast and sufficient servo control, and realizes excellent wow flutter characteristics.<br>In addition, stable rotational speed can be obtained even if load conditions such as needle pressure change. In addition to temperature compensation, the servo circuit has a built-in DC stabilized power supply so that rotational speed is not affected by fluctuations in power supply frequency, voltage and temperature.<br><br>The same solid rotor type AC torque motor as the DP-3000 is used for the drive motor.<br>Compared to synchronous motors and DC motors, this motor has smooth rotation characteristics with less vibration. In addition, since it is driven by AC with neatly shaped waveform, there is almost no rumble.<br><br>Weight of 1.1 kg and inertial mass of 160kg-cm by the adoption of speed detection system with fast response and stable servo type.<sup>2</sup>As a result, the starting characteristic is less than 1/2 revolution, and the life is extended by reducing the bearing load of the motor.<br><br>The cabinet is designed with a combination of aluminum die-cast frame and 53 mm thick wooden arm board.<br>Viscoelastic material is used in various parts such as the joint part between frame and arm board, dust cover, arm mounting part, etc., and excellent vibration damping effect is obtained by combining with the effect of leg insulator.<br><br>The tone arm is a laterally balanced S-shape designed for use with a light needle pressure cartridge. This arm is not equipped with an inside for scan seller due to DENON&#39;s long experience as a professional use. The needle pressure adjustment is a micrometer type direct reading type.<br>The rotary bearing section has the same consideration as the arm for broadcasting station in order to always maintain high sensitivity and high reliability. The horizontal rotary bearing has two high-grade miniature bearings protected by a double housing. The vertical rotary section combines an angular type bearing protected by a special elastic material with minimal friction change and a hardened and precision polished pivot, so that it is stable against external vibration and impact, while at the same time minimizing resonance of the arm itself.<br><br>A special low-capacity output code is used for the code so that the high-frequency characteristics are not impaired even when playing 4-channel records.<br><br>The rubber sheet is 5 mm thick and has a shape that makes it easy to handle records. The surface has been given an antistatic treatment.<br><br>The manufactured DP 2700 is shipped after a long running test (aging) after a strict product inspection.</p>
