				<p class="detail">Stereo cassette deck equipped with spectro-peak indicator and SA (Senalloy) head.<br><br>Uses Sen-alloy head for the head.<br>This head has a structure in which a Sendust chip is bonded at high temperature to the tape sliding surface of a core laminated with six layers of Permalloy. It has excellent characteristics by maintaining high gap accuracy while taking advantage of multi-layer with low overcurrent loss and good high-frequency characteristics.<br><br>Equipped with a spectro-peak indicator which is a further development of the 5-point peak indicator.<br>This peak indicator divides the frequency band into five sections and displays the peak components of each center frequency (100 Hz, 300 Hz, 1 kHz, 3 kHz, and 10 kHz) with five square LEDs for a total of 25. This makes it easy to check the presence or absence of recording input, frequency distribution, and peak level.<br>In addition, by checking the spectrum peak indicator, it is possible to adjust the recording level with higher sound quality. For music with little undulation (chamber music, BGM, etc.), the 100 Hz to 3 kHz indicator is set to + 3 dB, the 10 kHz indicator is set to -5dB at the maximum, and the VU meter needle is set to + 2 dB as a guide. For music with loud impact (rock, jazz, etc.), the signal level indicated by the VU meter is set to + 3 dB at 3 kHz or less, and 0 dB at 10 kHz is set to light occasionally, and the average signal level indicated by the VU meter is set to 0 dB at the maximum.<br><br>The head amplifier is a PNP-NPN2-stage direct connection DC feedback amplifier. In addition, the playback equalizer and microphone amplifier are independent from each other and the optimum circuit constant is selected to improve the characteristics.<br>A carefully selected low-noise IC is used for the IC, and an operational amplifier with a large amplification factor is used for the headphone amplifier.<br><br>In order to eliminate high-frequency noise such as tape hiss regardless of the performance of the head or amplifier, the ANRS automatic noise reduction device developed by JVC is mounted. In this circuit, the high-frequency range of the input signal is raised in advance during recording, and only the level of the tape hiss is relatively lowered by flattening it during playback.<br>In addition, by further developing the principle of ANRS, it is equipped with a SuperANRS which greatly improves the lack of high-frequency linearity and narrow dynamic range. By adopting an IC circuit, sound quality and reliability are improved.<br><br>The BIAS and EQ can be adjusted independently in three stages, allowing you to select a position that matches the characteristics of the tape.<br>In addition, the BIAS and EQ selector switches are equipped with REC and EQ switches to more precisely correct the high-frequency characteristics, which are not sufficient with the BIAS and EQ selector switches alone. The frequency characteristics during recording can be changed in five steps from -3dB to + 3 dB in 1.5 dB steps at 10 kHz, making it possible to record more flatly.<br><br>The mechanism section employs a 2-motor ID (Independent Drive) mechanism with dedicated motors for the capstan drive (FG servo motor) and reel drive (DC motor). This reduces mutual interference caused by delicate vibrations from the rotating system, simplifies the transmission mechanism, and improves stability and durability.<br>Moreover, we have achieved a wow flutter of 0.05% by using high-precision parts such as 80 mm flywheels with accurate dynamic balance and capstan shafts with a roundness of 0.1 μ.<br><br>Full logic control using IC and MSI (medium-scale integrated circuit) is adopted.<br><br>The cassette door employs a combination of a gear and an oil dump. When it is opened, it can be opened slowly at constant speed, and when it is closed, it can be closed lightly by canceling this mechanism.<br>In addition, there is a remaining tape light which can check the remaining tape amount.<br><br>Uses a pure electronic auto-stop mechanism that detects electromotive force with a Hall element.<br><br>Equipped with a continuous timer standby mechanism capable of recording the absence and playing the alarm clock.<br><br>A memory counter, output volume, MIC/DIN and LINE input selector switch are provided.<br><br>There was a special rack handle sold separately.</p>
