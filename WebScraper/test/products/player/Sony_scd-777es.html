				<p class="detail">This is the first SACD player in the ES series developed by inheriting the design philosophy of SCD-1.<br><br>The SCD 777 es is for 2-channel stereo only and does not support SACD multi-channel playback.<br><br>SACD decodes DSD digital data recorded on a disk and generates 1-bit pulse signals.<br>The decoder circuit for processing the DSD signal is mounted as an LSI, and the circuit wiring is shortened along with the improvement of reliability to realize high-speed processing.<br><br>The DSD signal of SACD expresses the music signal by the pulse density, and in order to maintain high accuracy, it is important how accurately the pulse is reproduced. The accuracy of this pulse reproduction is determined by the accuracy in the direction of the amplitude axis and the accuracy in the direction of the time axis. The SCD-1 is equipped with an ACP system and a current pulse D/A converter for accuracy in the direction of the amplitude axis, and an S-TACT pulse generator for accuracy in the direction of the time axis.<br><br>An ACP system (Accurate Complementary Pulse Density modulation System) is installed to eliminate the effect of switching distortion.<br>In the ACP system, even 0 signals that do not normally output pulses are processed so that pulses are output, and the pulse widths of 1 and 0 are processed so that they have a complementary relationship with each other, so that the information of &quot;presence / absence&quot; of pulses is converted into information of &quot;wide / narrow&quot; of pulses, so that even if switching distortion occurs, it does not affect the accuracy of the DSD signal itself, making it possible to convert wide-band music signals into analog signals with high purity.<br><br>It is equipped with S-TACT (Syncronus Time Accuracy Controller) in order to improve the fluctuation of time base.<br>The pulse generator reads the input digital data and generates a highly accurate pulse signal. The pulse is generated using a high-purity clock with a quartz oscillator, and has extremely high time axis accuracy with quartz accuracy.<br>In the LSI for S-TACT, the digital calculation section is placed on the ACP side to separate the pulse generation section from the digital calculation section, thereby eliminating the adverse effect of switching noise generated in the digital calculation section and enabling pulse generation with quartz accuracy.<br><br>The D/A converter is equipped with a current pulse D/A converter.<br>The DSD signal with improved switching distortion and time axis fluctuation by the ACP system and S-TACT is a high-precision voltage pulse, but in the case of a voltage pulse, the amplitude of the pulse may change subtly depending on the response at the time of switching.<br>The current pulse D/A converter has a stable constant current source inside, and is converted into a cleaner current pulse by switching the current source using a voltage pulse.<br><br>The digital filter used when playing CDs is equipped with a 24-bit variable (V. C.) digital filter.<br>This filter has more computing power than conventional filters. It has 24-bit accuracy and allows direct 8 x oversampling in a single operation. In addition, there are 5 filter positions where you can enjoy changing the sound.<br>Additional filter positions include the #1 Clear, which has been processed to make the signal smoother, and the #3 Fine position, Sony&#39;s first even-order filter.<br><br>The analog low-pass filter is a GIC type that does not have an active element in the signal path to reduce the coloring caused by the element, and the cutoff frequency and cutoff characteristics are selected to provide an appropriate playback band.<br><br>The newly developed twin pickup is used in the pickup section to improve the reliability of signal reading by providing an optimum wavelength pickup.<br>In addition, the optical system fixing mechanism is adopted for the signal reading method, and the pickup, which is easily affected by vibration, is fixed, and the heavy disk side is moved horizontally slowly. This reduces the fluctuation of the servo current controlling the pickup and enables stable signal reading.<br><br>Newly developed high-rigidity aluminum die-cast is used for the drive spindle motor.<br>A sapphire bearing is used for the support part and a ruby ball is used for the rotating part to reduce servo current by reducing rotational friction loss at the contact point.<br><br>It has a strong structure and adopts a top loading system that is resistant to vibration.<br>When opening and closing, the panel rises slightly and slides smoothly.<br><br>BP chassis is used for the chassis structure.<br>This chassis has a simple structure consisting of a base chassis with two metal plates attached to it to a thickness of 10 mm and seven cast iron pillars to which side plates and top plates are attached. By increasing the strength of the constituent materials, the chassis has a simple structure with sufficient rigidity and a large space inside the chassis.<br><br>A twin transformer configuration is used for the power supply, and dedicated R-core transformers are installed for each of the audio circuit and servo / digital system.<br>The transformer employs a circular, unbroken, doughnut-shaped core that greatly reduces magnetic flux leakage and vibration. The power supply circuit uses discrete circuit boards with superior sound quality, and carefully selected electrolytic capacitors and other parts are used.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.<br>This remote control is a thin design with a clickable key switch and 1 mm thick aluminum plate.</p>
