				<p class="detail">A CD transport equipped with a Word Sync terminal and D/D converter in the VRDS mechanism that takes over the blood line of P-0.<br><br>The mechanism part is equipped with the VRDS mechanism.<br>This mechanism clamps the disk firmly on a high-mass turntable with the same diameter as the disk, and completely eliminates the natural vibration of the disk itself and unnecessary vibration of the mechanism system. In addition, the warpage and distortion of the disk are corrected by giving an extremely gentle inclination to the crimping surface of the disk. The pickup, which is finely adjusted to the same angle as the inclination angle of the turntable, always realizes accurate pit reading at the center of the pickup optical axis. By greatly improving the relative optical axis accuracy between the optical pickup and the disk pit surface, unnecessary servo current is reduced. These measures greatly reduce disk reading errors and prevent timing errors (jitter) in the clock circuit.<br>The P-70 greatly improves the machining accuracy of all surfaces including the disk crimping surface. By adopting a newly designed aluminum / brass composite turntable, the squeal noise during disk rotation is greatly reduced. In addition, the turntable is dyed in green to absorb unwanted diffuse reflection and improve the sound quality. The surface of this turntable is 1.6 μ m and the taper is 0.5 ° precision machined.<br>In addition, in order to securely hold the newly developed turntable, a machined aluminum bridge with a thickness of up to 20 mm is used for the bridge part, and in addition, a composite structure bridge is adopted for the motor bearing on the upper part of the bridge, which is made of carbon tool steel (SK material) with high precision polishing treatment of 130x65mm and 5 mm thickness.<br><br>A newly developed spindle motor is used as the drive motor.<br>This motor uses a samarium-cobalt magnet with 10 times the energy compared to conventional motors to obtain strong torque and improve pit reading performance.<br><br>The chassis structure uses full-bodied construction.<br>This structure is a fully integrated structure directly connected to the body without any floating structure. Each part is 8 mm thick and heavy 8 kg metal board bottom base, 3 mm thick pure metal board top panel with rib structure for strength improvement, and aluminum front panel with maximum thickness of 10 mm. The precision design VRDS mechanism and inner chassis are firmly packaged. In addition, the front and both sides of the inner chassis are plated with copper plated steel plate and nickel plated to form a 1.6 mm thick structure, which eliminates internal interference as much as possible.<br>In addition, a pin-point insulator made of heavy cast iron is used for the leg part to realize a high-mass body with a total weight of 25 kg, which strengthens the countermeasure against internal and external vibration.<br><br>The pin-point insulator made of cast iron adopted for the leg is supported by 3 points, 2 points in the front and 1 point in the rear, and provides optimum mechanical grounding.<br>In addition, the center of gravity is laid out at the center of a triangle connecting three pin points.<br><br>The word sync terminal supports 44.1 kHz and 88.2 kHz.<br>A PLL circuit with an internal VCO is used to create a master clock (33.8688 MHz) that controls the inside of the device. This master clock is completely synchronized with the device that outputs the word sync, so that jitter in transport and in transmission can be ignored.<br>In addition, the P-70 uses a VCXO using a crystal oscillator to minimize the jitter of the VCO and can also select the PLL loop filter constant.<br>Since the word sync terminal is a BNC connector with a through-out terminal, other word sync transports can be connected. When the through-out terminal is used, the termination impedance is automatically switched.<br><br>RDOT (Refined Digital Output Technology) is used for upconversion of the D/D converter.<br>The RDOT is an analog-and-complementary technique based on the full entropy theory. It reproduces sound of 20 kHz or higher without distortion of time axis components. The RDOT is used to upconvert to 24bit/88.2 kHz, 176.4 kHz sampling frequency.<br>Two XLR two XLR terminals. 176.4<br><br>The digital outputs of all terminals (XLR, RCA and TOS) are land-locked by the master clock immediately before the output terminal to further improve jitter accuracy.<br><br>There is also a digital output that does not go through the D/D converter, and these outputs are also relocked by the master clock.<br><br>The power supply unit has a 2-transformer configuration that separates the mechanism and digital parts.<br>In addition, an 8-constant voltage power supply circuit is mounted to eliminate mutual interference of each circuit.<br><br>The latest transmitter IC for digital output uses AK4103 which is compatible with 192 kHz.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.<br><br>The P-70 was offered a version upgrade service from 2003 to 2005.<br>This version can handle 176.4 kHz word sync input, and the word sync terminal has been changed to BNC terminal of gold plating specification.<br>Carefully selected high-quality parts were used for the parts.<br>In addition, it has been changed to an integrated pinpoint foot that can be reliably installed for early P-70 users.</p>
