				<p class="detail">A CD player developed by incorporating the technology of a high-end machine.<br><br>The digital filter uses a 4 x oversampling digital filter.<br>The D/A converter employs a dual D/A converter in which the left and right channels are independent, eliminating the phase shift between the channels and improving the orientation.<br><br>The pickup section has no transmission mechanism such as gears, and uses a linear motor tracking mechanism that enables high-speed access with extremely quiet operation.<br>In addition, the base unit is equipped with a black-cemented base unit with excellent damping properties. This base unit is made by composite molding of metal and special ceramic containing powder with extremely high internal loss. As a result, the degree of Kyoshin sharpness is greatly reduced and high rigidity is obtained.<br>In addition, the entire mechanical block has a floating structure, and the influence of external vibration is cut off to prevent unnecessary vibration and resonance, thereby suppressing disturbance of servo current.<br><br>The base plate of the chassis is a double-walled chassis with a laminated structure consisting of two plates of sufficient thickness, and rigidity and vibration control are thoroughly enhanced.<br><br>It uses a taper chucking method that absorbs the eccentricity due to the error of the center hole of the disk and keeps it within a negligible range.<br><br>The servo circuit is equipped with S Servo II, which is an improved version of S Servo.<br>The operating principle of the S servo is that the RF-IC detects signal drop-out caused by scratches or dirt, calculates the timing of the next drop-out based on the rotation cycle of the disk, and optimally controls the servo amount of both tracking and focus servo circuits just before the drop-out to minimize the occurrence of errors.<br>The S Servo II performs even more precise predictive control of the servo amount. The prediction time accuracy is improved from 1/8,000 second to 1/10,000 second. Moreover, by supporting CLV (constant linear velocity), this accuracy is maintained at any position inside and outside the disk. Compared to the method in which the servo amount is controlled after the drop-out occurs, the trace stability is improved and the disturbance of the servo current is greatly reduced.<br><br>The analog circuit has a twin-mono configuration that follows the signal flow, and phase shift and mutual interference between channels are eliminated from the root. In addition, the circuit configuration has been greatly simplified by incorporating digital filters.<br>In addition, the MOS gate transfer method is adopted for digital data transmission to the analog system to prevent data current from mixing into the analog system ground, thereby eliminating factors of sound quality degradation.<br><br>Nine independent stabilized power supplies are used for the power supply section to eliminate mutual interference between circuits.<br><br>It is equipped with a digital processing soft muting circuit, and it prevents click noise by instantly muting when the performance stops or poses are operated.<br><br>Two digital outputs, coaxial and optical, are installed.<br>In addition, a digital / analog output changeover switch is mounted to prevent mutual interference.<br><br>There are two analog outputs, fixed and variable.<br><br>Equipped with line-out volume for headphone output as well.<br>These volumes can be controlled by remote control and are motor-driven when the volume is adjusted by remote control.<br><br>A custom file function is included as a new function.<br>This function allows the CD player to store up to 226 titles of music information and messages input by the listener for each disc. Each time a disc is replaced, the CD player automatically identifies which disc it is, recalls the memory, displays messages for each disc, and plays the disc according to the performance information.<br>Custom files have three functions : disk memos, custom indexes, and program banks. You can file disk notes and either custom indexes or program banks.<br>Disk Memo allows you to enter your own message up to 10 characters per disk.<br>The custom index can be set up to a maximum of 6 points per disk. To set the index, press the FILE button during playback to specify the point.<br>The program bank can store up to 20 program performance functions.<br>By memory backup, stored contents are retained even when power is turned off.<br><br>Equipped with a program edit function, editing program can be done for each A/B side of the tape at one time.<br><br>It has a delete shuffle function that allows you to shuffle and play only your favorite songs.<br><br>Equipped with 6-mode repeat of 1 song / whole song / part (remote control only) / program / shuffle / custom index.<br><br>It is equipped with a time keeper function with the next display to know the next program performance music.<br><br>Equipped with auto space / auto pause function.<br><br>Equipped with Music Search.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
