				<p class="detail">This tape deck is designed to improve its high performance and operability by integrating 20 years of experience and know-how of deck making and the latest technology.<br><br>The mechanism section employs a direct drive system using a DC servo electronic commutator motor. The direct drive system has the advantage of less slip and uneven rotation due to the reduction mechanism. In addition, the 88 mm φ outer rotor type flywheel and high-precision capstan realizes an excellent rotation mechanism.<br>The A-5300 motor has a servo detection coil wound in parallel with the drive coil. When the motor rotates, the servo detection coil generates a voltage proportional to the number of rotations. This voltage is converted into a control voltage and sent to the servo amplifier of the motor. When the rotation speed increases, the motor drive voltage is lowered. When the rotation speed decreases, the voltage is increased. In order to obtain accurate rotation, we use capstan shafts manufactured with a precision of 0.15 microns in roundness.<br><br>The reel motor uses a DC-reel motor that provides ideal torque against tape tension and is less susceptible to cocking and vibration, resulting in improved high-frequency flutter characteristics.<br>The compact and lightweight design also reduces heat generation and power consumption, improving efficiency. In addition, the brake mechanism of the motor also protects the tape from damage.<br><br>An IC logic control circuit is used in the drive section of the tape deck. In combination with a soft-touch keyboard switch, all operating modes are electronically controlled.<br>The operation of the mechanism is controlled by a logic circuit using more than 10 ICs, and the highly reliable keyboard switches used in desktop computers are used as frequently used switches.<br>By combining this IC logic control circuit and DC motor, the output signal of each mode of the IC logic circuit drives the switching circuit of the transistor and activates the plunger solenoid motor, which reduces click noise during operation.<br><br>Equipped with a real-time pause mechanism.<br>In the A-5300, in addition to the plunger for constant speed running, the plunger solenoid for pause is used for the plunger that operates the pinch roller. This allows the pinch roller to pull in the lifter when entering a pause from recording mode, allowing the tape to remain in contact with the head for erasing, recording, and playback. In addition, the pinch roller does not return to the stop state as with the conventional pause mechanism. Because the pinch roller is located very close to the capstan, the tape is sent as soon as you start recording.<br><br>It is equipped with an independent selector switch that provides the optimum bias and equalizer for low-noise and regular tapes, and with a level selector switch that allows the recording level to be 3 VU higher, taking advantage of the 3-5dB dynamic margin of low-noise tapes.<br><br>Equipped with a high-precision, large double-scale expanded type VU meter.<br>It is linked with the level selector switch, and the maximum level can be adjusted to plus 6 vu (high) or plus 3 vu (normal) depending on the tape used.<br><br>High hardness permalloy head is used for the head.<br><br>It uses a volume equipped with memory markers that are convenient for marking input and output levels.<br><br>Oatley verse is possible by attaching sensing foils to the end of the tape (base side). Also, if you attach foils to the beginning and end of the tape (magnetic side), it will be repeated playback g red brain.<br><br>The microphone input and the line input are fed independently by the circuit design, making it possible to mix the microphone and line.<br><br>Equipped with a shut-off arm that stops the mechanism automatically when the tape is finished winding.<br><br>Equipped with a 4-digit index counter that is convenient for finding the beginning of the program position.<br><br>It is equipped with a reel stand height adjustment mechanism so that the tape does not rub against the reel and get damaged depending on the thickness of the reel.<br><br>It uses a quick lock reel clamper and can set the reel just by turning the shaft to the right.<br><br>Equipped with two Input/Output terminals that can be used by two systems.<br><br>Timer recording / playback is possible by combining the timer control adapter and timer (sold separately).<br><br>Operation from a remote location is possible by using the separately sold remote control unit.</p>
