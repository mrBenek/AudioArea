				<p class="detail">While inheriting the performance of the GX-Z 9100 GX-Z ev.<br><br>The GXISM (The Super Glass &amp; X&#39; tal Head Independent Separated Mount) has been adopted with an improved head mount structure to bring out the basic functions of the Super GX Head further.<br>The GXISM is a fully independent mounting system and has a structure in which the recording head and the reproducing head are mounted separately. This makes it possible to individually adjust the azimuth of the recording head and the reproducing head, which was impossible to adjust with a combination type head. Even after the head is incorporated into the mechanism, it can be adjusted to the highest phase characteristic according to the tape running of each unit.<br>The head winding uses &quot;LC-OFC Class 1 material (Quantum),&quot; the highest grade oxygen-free copper wire in which the content of hydrogen gas, which is harmful to sound quality, is reduced as much as possible.<br><br>It is the first commercial cassette deck to use a balanced transmission for the playback equalizer circuit, reducing the influence of electromagnetic interference, which is a major factor affecting sound quality. It also uses a Dolby NR pass circuit. When the Dolby NR is turned off, the output of the playback equalizer is line output as it is, making it possible to output in the shortest signal path.<br>In addition, we have adopted a fully connected DC amplifier with no coupling capacitor that affects sound quality from the head to the lineout (at NR pass). We have also adopted an element that matches the Super GX head for the regenerative equalizer amplifier to ensure low noise.<br><br>The newly developed dual construction reel (D-C-R system) is used to drive the tape take-up reel in order to make the travel of the cassette tape smoother, thereby absorbing torque unevenness of the reel motor during recording and playback of the tape and further improving wow flutter.<br>In addition, it is equipped with the traditional closed-loop double capstan DD tape transport mechanism with ceramic composite tape guide and high grip processed capstan, and it maintains stable tape running for a long time and improves running characteristics.<br><br>Separate block construction is used for the internal construction.<br>In this structure, the amplifier block and the deck mechanism / system control system are separated and separated by the chassis. In addition, the inside of the deck is made into upper and lower double structure to implement fine shielding measures. This prevents harmful noise emitted from the mechanism, control microcomputer, display, etc. from interfering with the amplifier circuit.<br>In addition, the highly rigid chassis design eliminates vibration and resonance effects.<br><br>Ceramic composite materials are used in cassette stabilizers and side panels (high-density resin) to reduce external vibration.<br><br>In order to reduce the adverse effect on sound quality caused by unwanted vibration of the cassette half, the cassette stabilizer is made of a high-vibration absorbing material, such as sorbocein, and a non-magnetic ceramic composite material that is effective in reducing vibration. In addition, in order to accommodate cassette half of various shapes, the surface that contacts the half is processed into a convex shape to improve adhesion.<br>Also, aluminum is used for the cassette lid.<br><br>Equipped with a manual bias / level calibration mechanism, the built-in oscillator (400Hz/16kHz) can be used to maximize the characteristics of the tape.<br><br>The power supply is independent from the transformer winding for each block of the amplifier and system control display system, and the stabilizing power supply is independent for each block of the equalizer circuit, Dolby circuit and headphone amplifier to reduce mutual interference.<br><br>By adopting a high frequency bias circuit and raising the bias oscillation frequency to 210 kHz, more than double the conventional frequency, beat interference due to interference with music signals is suppressed, and the effect of the bias trap filter on the audible band is reduced.<br><br>Equipped with a display-off function, caused by the FL display can be suppressed.<br><br>Equipped with a CD/DAT direct connector with input sensitivity optimum for the output level of CD/DAT.<br><br>A film type bypass capacitor is used for canceling microcomputer noise.<br><br>Equipped with Dolby HX-PRO, which improves high-frequency characteristics.<br>In addition, Dolby B/C NR is installed as a noise reduction system.<br><br>A silent mechanism is adopted.<br><br>Direct Lead-In &amp; Power Eject, Auto Tape Selector, Real-time Counter, Auto Monitor, A-B repeat, Rec Cancel, etc.<br><br>Equipped with IPSS function, you can skip up to 16 songs in front and back.<br><br>Gold plating is applied to the input / output terminal and headphone terminal.<br><br>Power cord with polarity display is used.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
