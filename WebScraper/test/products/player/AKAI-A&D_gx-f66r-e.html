				<p class="detail">With long play and music selection functions, this cassette deck was announced as the top model of quick reverse deck.<br><br>The quick reverse operation uses an infrared tape sensor developed by Akai for the first time.<br>This sensor detects the next leader tape after the end of the magnetic tape segment and operates a reverse mechanism. In addition, the bi-counter capstan drive system is employed to make the characteristics of the reciprocating tapes uniform. Special capstan shafts and pinch rollers are provided for each of the reciprocating tapes, making it possible to make the characteristics of the reciprocating tapes uniform.<br>In addition, AKAI&#39;s unique linear motion mechanism, which quickly shifts the recording and reproducing head back and forth, supports tracks on tapes with different normal and reverse directions.<br><br>By switching between the 3 positions of the reverse selector, you can enjoy 3 types of tape play : one way recording / playback, one round recording / playback from the normal direction, one way recording / playback from the reverse direction, one round recording / playback from the normal direction and endless playback, one way recording / playback from the reverse direction and endless playback.<br><br>AKAI&#39;s unique Twin Field Super GX head, which has a recording gap (4 μ m) and a reproducing gap (1 μ m) in one head housing, provides the same performance as the 3-head system.<br><br>In the mechanism section, dedicated DC motors are used for the capstan and reel respectively to obtain stable performance and durability.<br>In addition, in order to eliminate tape deflection and uneven crimping at the recording / reproducing head, which directly affect sound quality, we have adopted a unique red travel mechanism, and the tape during travel is firmly held by the tape guides on the left and right of the recording / reproducing head.<br><br>It is equipped with RPSS (Random Program Search System) which enables four types of autoplay by a special microcomputer.<br>You can perform sequential play, random play, skip play, and repeat program up to 99 times in the specified order of songs.<br><br>It is equipped with an intro-scan mechanism that plays only the intro-portion of a song every 10 seconds and a blank search function.<br>In addition, it is equipped with a recording cancellation mechanism. When the switch is pressed, the tape is rewound to the head position of the part which was recorded by mistake, and it enters the recording standby state.<br><br>Equipped with an auto-mute mechanism that automatically sets a silent recording period of approximately four seconds and activates the REC standby mode.<br>Press and hold if you need more than 4 seconds.<br><br>Equipped with an auto tape selector, it detects the type of Normal, CrO2 and Metal tapes just by inserting the tape into the holder, and automatically sets the bias and equalizer to the values suitable for each tape.<br><br>Equipped with a digital bar meter that can be used as both a VU meter and a peak meter by switching the switch.<br>It is equipped with a function that can hold the maximum value for approximately 1 second for 0 VU or more so that the maximum level can be read in both peak and VU cases.<br><br>Equipped with a tape counter and an LED digital display for displaying programs.<br>It is a 4-digit tape counter in normal operation and a 2-digit counter when the RPSS system is used. The program is displayed and &quot;Err&quot; is displayed when there is an error in the program.<br><br>An MPX filter switch is provided to prevent the 19 kHz pilot signal from causing a malfunction of the Dolby NR when recording an FM stereo broadcast transmission.<br><br>Equipped with a timer start mechanism.<br><br>Equipped with mono-microphone mechanism.<br><br>Equipped with a remote control terminal to which a separately sold remote control unit can be connected.</p>
