				<p class="detail">CD player with 16fs45-bit staggered 4D/A conversion system.<br><br>The D/A converter is equipped with a 16 fs 45-bit noise shaping staggered 4D/A converter.<br>This method uses an 8 fs 45-bit noise-shaping digital filter CXD-1244 developed by Sony. It uses two D/A converters per channel, one with 8 fs digital data as it is and the other with a half-cycle delay. The two outputs are combined at a later stage to achieve high-precision 16fsD/A conversion while maintaining low glitch.<br>The four D/A converters use an 18-bit linear type to achieve low-noise sound quality.<br><br>A direct digital sink is used to prevent phase disturbance caused by jitter.<br>In the CDP 990, a digital sync IC connected to the D/A converter readjusts the voltage time axis of the digital signal to the accuracy of the master clock, which is free from jitter, and sends it to the D/A converter, enabling more faithful D/A conversion with accurate phase.<br><br>The digital circuit is equipped with the next-generation LSI CXD-2500, the fourth generation.<br>In the CXD 2500, the RAM capacity has been increased to 32 kbit from the conventional external configuration. Moreover, it is integrated into a single chip. This enables digital data exchange inside the LSI, greatly reducing unnecessary radiation noise, reducing interference with audio circuits, and improving error correction capability.<br><br>A newly developed pickup with a built-in RF amplifier is used in the pickup section, enabling low-impedance signal output and improving sound quality through low-noise and high-stability.<br><br>The servo circuit is equipped with S Servo III.<br>The S Servo II prevents the disturbance of the servo current from adversely affecting the analog section through the power supply. Noise components that adversely affect the analog section are removed with a low-pass filter to supply a smooth servo current. In addition, the power supply from the weak power supply section is stabilized to reduce the influence on the audio circuit.<br><br>FB chassis is used for the chassis structure.<br>The FB chassis uses a metal material with sufficient thickness and strength for the chassis material, and the whole chassis is firmly joined by the frame surrounding the outer circumference and the beams before and after passing the front and rear to reduce internal and external vibrations that muddy the sound quality.<br><br>The disc tray uses a G tray made of the same material as the G base unit used in high-end models.<br>The G-tray is made of a glass-fiber reinforced plastic containing calcium carbonate, which is the same as that of marbles. By reducing the Kyoshin sharpness, unnecessary external vibration is prevented from being applied to the disc.<br><br>In order to prevent the vibration of the power transformer from being transmitted to the audio circuit, rubber dampers are used at four locations and are installed in a floating manner.<br><br>Aluminum front panel is used for the front panel.<br><br></p>

            <p class="detail">Equipped with a custom edit function, you can perform seven functions : peak search, multi-disc program, time edit, program edit, time fade, variable fade and manual fader.<br><br>With the Peak Search function, you can perform a high-speed search of all songs and play them repeatedly for about 4 seconds before and after the point where the volume level is the highest.<br><br>The multi-disk program feature allows you to edit tapes across multiple disks.<br>Insert a disc and press the multi-program button to display Disc-1. Program the song you want to insert, eject it, insert the second disc, and program the song you want to insert.<br>You can program up to 24 songs on up to 6 discs. When editing, &quot;Next Disc&quot; appears every time one disc is finished, and playback is complete until &quot;-END -&quot; appears.<br><br>With the Time Edit function, you can use the Time Set button or the Direct Key to set the length of one side of the tape. When you press the Edit button, the program is performed for side A starting with the first track. If you encounter a time-over track, the program automatically sets the longest track among the tracks that fit within the time. When you press the Edit button again, the program is performed for side B.<br>You can also program the songs you want to include first and then time-edit the remaining time.<br><br>With the Program Edit function, you can program your favorite songs in any order while checking the accumulated time using the direct keys or AMS keys. When you press the pause button, the A side is completed, and then the B side is completed at once.<br><br>With the time fade function, if you enter the length of the tape, it fades out at the specified time.<br><br>The Variable Fade function allows you to change the fade-in / fade-out operation time in units of one second from 2 seconds to 10 seconds.<br><br>With the manual faders, you can fade in / out at the desired location.<br><br></p>

            <p class="detail">Equipped with the custom file function, you can use 6 functions such as level file, disk memo, custom index, program bank, last mode memory and file recall.<br><br>The Level File function allows you to store the desired playback level for each disc. Simply adjust the Line Out Volume to your preference and press the Level File button. When the disc is inserted again, it is automatically set to the stored level.<br><br>The Disk Memo feature allows you to record messages of up to 10 characters per disk.<br>You can use a total of 46 alphanumeric characters plus special symbols.<br><br>With the custom index function, you can set your own index at any point in a song without having to record an index on the disc.<br>Up to 10 points can be set per disc, with a rehearse function that allows fine adjustment in steps of approximately ± 0.15 seconds.<br><br>The Program Bank function allows you to record programs set by the Program Performance function as they are.<br><br>The last mode memory function stores the play mode, repeat, fade time, and auto space that were set just before the disc was taken out of the tray. When the disc is loaded again, that mode is automatically recalled.<br><br>The File Recall function allows you to check the files you have inserted without having to insert the disc, and to delete the files on the spot.<br><br></p>
            
            <hr>
            <p class="detail">Equipped with a multi-mode timer function, you can select a play mode such as program music, shuffle play or custom index and play it with a timer.<br><br>It is equipped with a delete shuffle function corresponding to 99 songs that you can leave only your favorite songs and play them randomly.<br><br>The display section has a 20-track music calendar.<br><br>It has a program performance function of up to 24 songs.<br><br>Equipped with 7-mode repeat function of 1 song / all songs / part (remote control only) / program / shuffle / delete shuffle / custom index.<br><br>It is equipped with an autospace function that adjusts the interval between songs to 3 seconds and can be operated only from a remote control.<br><br>It is equipped with index search and can be operated only from remote control.<br><br>Equipped with 2-speed music search for fast forward / fast backward while listening to music.<br>Slow mode can only be operated from the remote control.<br><br>Equipped with full / partial ON / OFF display mode function and can be operated from remote control.<br><br>It is equipped with two line outputs, fixed and variable. It is also equipped with a headphone port with volume linked to the lineout.<br>The volume is designed so that the LED flashes when the remote control is operated.<br><br>Equipped with an optical digital output.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
