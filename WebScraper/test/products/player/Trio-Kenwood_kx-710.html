				<p class="detail">This stereo cassette deck adopts the DC servo motor introduced at the same time as the KX-910.<br><br>It employs 90 φ flywheels with rotational energy that is approximately twice that of conventional 70 φ flywheels. This greatly reduces wow flutter and realizes stable tape travel.<br>In addition, flat belt is used for the drive belt for the flywheels. Both sides can be polished to eliminate unevenness in thickness. Therefore, there is less unevenness in slip compared to the square belt and the wow flutter is improved.<br><br>The drive motor uses a high-torque DC servo motor that maintains the specified rotation speed of 2,000 rpm even at a load torque of 70g-cm.<br><br>The mechanism chassis is made of steel material with a thickness of 1.4 mm. By greatly improving the mechanical strength, deviation of flatness is minimized as much as possible. By this, vibration generated from the rotating part can be absorbed, and flutter is improved by cutting vibration transmission to the head part.<br>The accuracy of the head has also been improved by improving the thickness of the head plate to 1.6 mm.<br><br>The capstan has been given an ultra-precision finish to achieve a roundness of 0.1 μ.<br><br>Equipped with an auto-stop mechanism, the pinch roller automatically separates from the capstan as the head separates from the tape when the tape finishes running, and the operation button is turned OFF. This prevents excessive force from being applied to the motor and tape to maintain initial performance.<br><br>A constant voltage circuit is adopted for all blocks of the power supply section, and by always keeping the power supply voltage constant, fluctuation of oscillation output of recording bias is suppressed and frequency characteristics are improved.<br><br>The recording / reproducing head uses ultra-hard SFH (Super Ferrite Head), which has low high-frequency loss and maintains semi-permanently stable frequency characteristics. Since this head has excellent abrasion resistance, it reduces disturbance of characteristics caused by unbalanced head wear.<br><br>The recording magnetic flux density of the tape is set to 160 pwb as the recording reference level of 0 vu. Since the saturation level of the tape is approximately 10 dB, recording with a wide dynamic range and less distortion is possible.<br><br>It is equipped with a peak level indicator using LED, and can be checked when a large input near the saturation point of the tape is input.<br>Since this indicator lights up at 250 pwb, the saturation level is approximately 6 dB, enabling recording with plenty of room.<br><br>Equipped with ALC (auto-level control) circuit.<br>If the ALC circuit is turned ON when recording a source with a wide dynamic range, sound with little distortion can be recorded even if an excessive input is input.<br><br>The microphone amplifier and the line amplifier are designed separately.<br>By installing separate amplifiers for microphone and line recording, it is possible to prevent the deterioration of the SN ratio caused by the attenuation of the line to the microphone level when the amplifier is shared, and recording with good linearity is possible.<br><br>It is equipped with a queue / review function, and you can fast forward and rewind while producing a playback sound.<br><br>Built-in memory rewind function.<br>With this function, for example, if you set the tape counter to 000 when recording and turn on the memory switch, REW after recording stops automatically at 999.<br><br>Equipped with a level meter.<br><br>The Dolby System is installed as a noise reduction system to reduce noise such as noise caused by tape hiss.<br><br>It is equipped with Dolby FM copy function for listening and air checking of FM broadcasting through Dolby system.<br><br>Equipped with an auto tape selector. When a chrome tape with a detection hole is attached, it is automatically switched to an equalizer circuit for chrome tape.<br><br>The push button arrangement adopts a duplex (two stage arrangement) system in which the tape operation buttons are divided into a running function and a stop function.<br>In this system, the frequently used travel function is placed at the front, and all seven buttons are placed within the range of one hand to improve operability.</p>
