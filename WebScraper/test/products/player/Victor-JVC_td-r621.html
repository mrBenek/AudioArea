				<p class="detail">Quick reverse deck that adopts fine axis reverse mechanism.<br><br>The reverse mechanism uses a fine-axis reverse mechanism. The rotation center of the head and the track center of the tape are finely adjusted, and the relative position (axis = axis) of each is accurately maintained. Thus, the high-frequency characteristics of the outward and return paths are maintained at the same level.<br>In addition, the drive force is strengthened and stabilized by the 2-point holding structure that minimizes the fluctuation of the tip of the rotating head, the precision of parts on the order of 10 microns, and the mechanical base made of aluminum die cast.<br><br>It employs a silent mechanism composed of a 2-motor full logic mechanism and a motor for driving the mechanism. It uses a microcomputer to quickly judge tape reversal caused by head rotation, and minimizes the sound loss of songs.<br><br>The recording / reproducing head is equipped with a newly developed fine amorphous head with excellent high-frequency characteristics and magnetic balance.<br>In addition, by using PC-OCC wire for head winding, purer transmission is achieved.<br><br>As a countermeasure against interference between the amplifier and control section, a two box layout with a separate structure is adopted.<br>In addition, by adopting the remote bar, the input selector and volume are controlled close to the input terminal of the rear panel, eliminating the mixing of noise.<br><br>In order to prevent unnecessary vibration from occurring in the body, high density and high rigidity front mold base and large insulation foot are adopted.<br>The newly developed half-shell stabilizer reduces vibration of the cassette half itself.<br><br>The power supply section employs a low-output impedance power supply with ± tracking control using a large transformer and a large-capacity capacitor, providing a stable power supply that is resistant to complex changes in music signals and disturbance noise.<br><br>All stages of DC amplifier configuration with capacitors removed as much as possible is adopted for the audio circuit to improve phase characteristics, distortion factor and linearity.<br><br>A direct input terminal that does not pass through the amplifier is provided exclusively for the digital source.<br><br>Equipped with Dolby HX-PRO.<br>This circuit controls the effective bias to be constant according to the fluctuation of the input signal during recording. This circuit can greatly improve the high-frequency dynamic range. Since this system operates only during recording, recorded tapes can be played in high quality on other decks.<br><br>Equipped with Dolby B/C NR as a noise reduction system.<br><br>It is equipped with Music Scan, and you can start up 9 songs before and after the song you are listening now with the direct selection key of the remote control.<br><br>It is equipped with a digital counter with a remaining time display function. When the length of the cassette tape is set, the remaining time of the tape can be checked automatically.<br><br>Equipped with a 16-dot peak meter.<br><br>Equipped with digital peak display function that can read peak level numerically.<br><br>Equipped with a memory stop function, it automatically stops when the memory button is pressed in the middle of fast forward or rewind.<br><br>It is equipped with a blank skip function that fast-forwards to the next song when there is a non-recording part for more than 10 seconds during playback.<br><br>Equipped with a block repeat function.<br>If you set the counter to 0000 for the starting point of the area you want to listen to and use the memory button to store the ending point, you can play only that section repeatedly.<br><br>Equipped with a timer start mechanism. By connecting an optional timer, you can record your absence or play an alarm clock.<br><br>Uses a power cord with polarity display.<br><br>Equipped with a bias adjustment function.<br><br>Equipped with MPX filter.<br><br>Equipped with a headphone port with volume.<br><br>Equipped with synchronized recording terminal.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.<br>In addition to basic operations, this remote control allows you to skip a song, reset the remaining time and counter, and switch memory locations.</p>
