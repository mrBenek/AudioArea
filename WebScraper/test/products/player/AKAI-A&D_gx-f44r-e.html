				<p class="detail">A stereo cassette deck equipped with functions such as quick reverse, Dolby NR / C type, introscan by microcomputer and blank search.<br><br>The head uses a twin field structure Super GX head.<br>This head uses HighBs and High μ ferrite materials to provide a recording gap (4 μ m) and a reproducing gap (1 μ m) in one head housing. This structure is equivalent to that of the 3-head system.<br><br>Highly reliable 2-motor mechanism is used for the mechanical part.<br>An electronically controlled DC-motor with excellent durability and low wow and flutter is mounted for the capstan, and a dedicated DC-motor with strong torque is mounted for the reel.<br><br>It is equipped with Quick Reverse developed by AKAI, and difficult problems which the reverse deck must solve are solved by the original technology.<br>First of all, for the sound blank in the leader tape portion that occurs when the tape is inverted, the tape guide with the built-in infrared tape sensor developed by Akai enables instantaneous inversion. This instantaneous inversion smooths the connection from the A side to the B side of the music.<br>In addition, a bi-counter capstan drive with dedicated capstan shafts and pinch rollers for both normal and reverse drives is installed in order to realize stable reciprocal tape travel. This makes it possible to achieve uniform reciprocating characteristics and good start-up when the tape is reversed.<br>In addition, in order to eliminate tape deflection and uneven crimping at the recording / reproducing head, which directly affect sound quality, we have adopted a unique traveling system. While moving, the tape is firmly held by the left and right tape guides at the recording / reproducing head, and this tape guide is designed to make the contact surface between the tape and the tape wider so that the edge of the tape does not become wavy.<br>Also, by installing an erase head outside the capstan, stable tape running is improved.<br>As for the trace of the tape track which differs in the round trip, it is cleared by accurately and quickly shifting the recording / reproducing head back and forth in the reverse.<br><br>In addition to Dolby NR / B type, it is equipped with Dolby NR / C type.<br>Although the operation principle of the Dolby NR / C type is the same as that of the conventional B type, the Dolby NR / C type uses B type circuits for low and high levels respectively. Moreover, the Dolby NR / C type incorporates spectral skewing and anti-frequency circuits to improve saturation characteristics in the high range.<br><br>By switching between the three positions of the reverse selector, you can record and play back in one direction, record and play back in one round trip from the normal direction (in the case of the reverse direction, record and play back one side), play back continuously after recording in one round trip, or play continuously.<br><br>Equipped with a blank search function, after automatically searching for the unrecorded portion (blank portion) of the tape just by pressing the switch, a blank for approximately 4 seconds is made and the recording standby (pause) is set.<br><br>Equipped with a recording cancellation mechanism, the tape is rewound up to the head position of the part recorded by mistake, and the state of recording standby (pause) is established.<br><br>Equipped with an intro-scan playback function, it is possible to play only the intro part of a song every 10 seconds.<br><br>It is equipped with an auto tape selector, an auto mute mechanism that can automatically set the interval between songs of approximately 4 seconds, an LED power meter, memory auto play, timer start mechanism for voice recording and alarm playback, output volume, and mono microphone mechanism that can record simultaneously on both left and right channels with a single microphone.<br><br>In addition to the silver model, there was also a pearl shadow model.</p>
