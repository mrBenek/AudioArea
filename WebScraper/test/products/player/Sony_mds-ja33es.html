				<p class="detail">This MD deck is a new prestige model of the ES series with high sound quality technology such as Type-R DSP for ATRAC.<br><br>In addition to the ATRAC DSP, which is the core of adaptive high-frequency control technology to improve signal processing, we have installed a Shinkai Type-R DSP with twice the signal processing capability. We also fully utilize the increased processing power provided by the newly developed intelligent bit rear-location algorithm to reanalyze music data and thoroughly search for minute levels of redundant bit allocation that were previously difficult to detect. This allows for better bit allocation and better reproducibility of the source signal because it is redistributed preferentially to the frequency band that is important for hearing.<br>In addition, each step of the calculation process has been revised to achieve extremely high precision calculation.<br><br>We have introduced wide bit stream technology using Type-R DSP for ATRAC. With 24-bit input / output and extended operation word length, recording and playback with a wide dynamic range of 20-bit accuracy exceeding the 16-bit MD format is possible.<br><br>The newly developed S-TACT IC is used for the pulse generation circuit. The IC configuration of only the pulse generation circuit realizes separation and independence from the digital calculation part, and suppresses the effect of digital noise on the time axis direction of the pulse.<br><br>It is equipped with a sampling rate converter that automatically converts 32 kHz and 48 kHz sampling frequency to 44.1 kHz.<br><br>A current pulse D/A converter is used for the D/A converter.<br>By converting pulses output as voltage into current pulses based on a current source and transmitting them, fluctuations in the power supply voltage and voltage noise generated by digital circuits are eliminated.<br><br>The power supply section uses an R-core transformer with a circular cross-section doughnut type with no breaks in the iron core of the transformer, greatly reducing magnetic flux leakage and vibration. In addition, one R-core transformer for audio and one R-core transformer for digital signal are installed to realize a power supply with less interference and fluctuation.<br><br>By making the circuit board and chassis non-parallel to each other, we have adopted a slant (non-parallel) mount circuit board that suppresses sound pressure applied to the circuit board and greatly reduces resonance.<br><br>A low center of gravity center tray loading system is used to load the disk. The tray loading section and base unit section are floated by an insulator and a compression coil spring. In addition, a material with excellent vibration damping characteristics called PBT is used for the mold to hold the base unit section. This reduces vibration to the disk and improves signal reading accuracy.<br><br>The chassis structure is made of metal material with sufficient strength and thickness. The FB chassis is firmly fixed as a single box with a frame surrounding the outer circumference and beams passed in front and back. By combining members of different shapes and sizes, natural vibrations are mutually cancelled, greatly reducing the vibration of the chassis as a whole.<br>In addition, the vibration of the chassis as a whole is greatly reduced by the introduction of vibration-resistant reinforcing members such as the adoption of reinforcing boards for the beam itself and the side surface of the chassis, and the use of two bottom plates.<br><br>Uses an eccentric insulator whose mounting hole to the chassis is offset from the center.<br>As a result, the vibrations transmitted from the outside cancel each other, making it difficult for them to be transmitted to the chassis. In particular, it is effective in attenuating the vibration components in the middle and high range that affect the sense of hearing.<br><br>Equipped with digital REC level control, the gain can be controlled from - ∞ dB to + 12 dB at the center of gain 0 dB.<br>It also has a built-in memory function that can store the set recording level for each input channel.<br><br>It uses a newly developed 24-bit variable (V. C.) digital filter. At the same time as the operation word length has increased to 24 bits, the operation speed has also increased, and the processing performance has been improved. As a result, the noise is further reduced and excellent expression performance is obtained.<br>In addition, there are four preset positions for the variable (V. C.) digital filter, so that you can enjoy changing the sound quality by changing the cutoff characteristics of the digital filter calculation.<br><br>It is equipped with Route 3 digital input corresponding to 24 bit and two digital outputs.<br><br>Equipped with a pitch control function, you can listen at different playback speeds from -98.5% to + 12.5%.<br><br>It is equipped with a music sync function. When you press the music sync button on the remote control and the connected device starts playing, it senses the input of a music signal and automatically starts recording.<br><br>It is equipped with a time machine recording function. If you press the multi-jog dial in the recording pause state, the sound recorded on the disc is traced back to the sound of up to 6 seconds before.<br><br>Equipped with a monaural recording and playback function that allows the disc to be used twice as long as the display.<br><br>It has a TOC EDTI function that allows you to divide, combine, and move songs. It also has an UNDO function that allows you to cancel the last edit and redo it.<br>It is also equipped with a rehearsal function so that you can make decisions while checking edit points in COMBINE or DIVIDE. You can move edit points finely by minute, second, or frame (approximately 0.01 second).<br><br>Equipped with the A-B ERASE function that allows you to easily erase between two specified points in a song.<br><br>It is equipped with a title function that can record up to 1,700 characters of disc names and song titles on the disc.<br>In addition to conventional alphabets, numbers and symbols, katakana characters can also be input, and input can be done from the main body or remote controller.<br><br>The SCMS (Serial Copy Management System) allows digital recording only for one generation and does not allow digital recording for two or more generations.<br><br>It is equipped with a smart space function that automatically adjusts silence periods of 3 seconds or more to approximately 3 seconds during digital recording.<br><br>Equipped with a timer standby function that can be combined with an optional timer for recording and playback.<br><br>Equipped with a control A1 jack, you can use various functions in combination with Sony&#39;s CD player.<br><br>It uses an FL display that can display track name and elapsed time, disc name and track name in two levels above and below.<br><br>Connection with a PC is possible by using MD-PC link kit PCLK-MD1 (sold separately).<br>This allows you to perform basic MD deck operations, disc editing and text entry on your PC.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
