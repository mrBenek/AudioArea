				<p class="detail">This is a double reverse cassette deck that can record 3 hours of consecutive absence.<br><br>Continuous recording between Deck I and Deck II is possible by microcomputer control.<br>In addition, by combining a tuner and a timer, it is possible to record continuously for 3 hours.<br><br>You can record two tapes two tapes simultaneously at one time.<br><br>Dubbing and editing can be done easily with the dubbing start &amp; stop button and the synchrorec mute.<br><br>Equipped with a long-time non-stop easy listening function for full playback of the A/B side of Deck I and Deck II.<br><br>You can play one deck while playing back the other deck.<br><br>Equipped with Dolby B/C NR as a noise reduction system.<br>The DD-VR9 is equipped with an MPX filter to prevent malfunctions.<br><br>Equipped with auto REC mute.<br>When this function is pressed in the REC mode, a silent space of approximately 4 to 5 seconds is automatically set to the REC standby mode. In addition, Victor&#39;s unique circuit design allows for no recording from the stop mode.<br><br>Equipped with Music Scan (Deck I, 1 song before and after).<br><br>Equipped with an auto tape select function.<br><br>Equipped with a running indicator that shows the tape running mode at a glance.<br><br>Equipped with a timer start mechanism.<br><br>The reverse mechanism uses a rotary head type Fine Axis Reverse System with a 3-layer die-cast structure.<br>This mechanism consists of a head mount base and a head holder for the rotating part. It uses a Jewel lock system to prevent distortion by pressing a ruby into the tip of the azimuth adjustment screw that receives the head holder. In addition, a stainless steel clamp plate is wound around the part of the head holder that is in contact with the ruby to improve abrasion resistance. The precision of all parts is on the order of 10 microns, and the die casting precision is ultra-precision processing.<br>The rotating part has been given molybdenum (baking) processing with good sliding and excellent temperature characteristics. There is no change in friction coefficient, smooth rotation can be ensured, and there is no play even in long-term use. In addition, we pursue accuracy by adopting a 2-point holding structure to minimize head tip fluctuation, and adopting a screw pitch of 1 / 2 of the normal screw pitch for azimuth adjustment and head height adjustment.<br>In addition, the head is not fixed directly to the head holder, but is inserted into the head clamp and press fit into the head holder. This allows not only independent azimuth adjustment in both forward and reverse directions but also head height adjustment. The relative position between the head and tape can be accurately determined in both directions. As a result, the frequency characteristics in both forward and reverse directions and the high-frequency characteristics that tend to fluctuate are maintained in automatic operation.<br><br>Flipping the tape from A to B is done by an infrared sensor embedded in the guide pin of the tape.<br>When the light emitted from the light-emitting device hits the splicing tape between the magnetic tape and the reader tape, the light-receiving device detects a change in the light and issues an inversion instruction, with a sound break of only 0.4 seconds.<br><br>The mechanism uses a 2-motor full logic and a silent mechanism with a mechanical drive motor. All modes are moved by detecting the position of the cam linked to the mechanical drive motor with a microcomputer.</p>
