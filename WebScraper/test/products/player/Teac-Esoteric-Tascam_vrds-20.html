				<p class="detail">A CD player developed as a high-end model of VRDS-10.<br><br>The mechanism part is equipped with TEAC&#39;s original VRDS (Vibration-Free Rigid Disc-Clamping System).<br>In this mechanism, the disc is pressed onto a high-mass turntable with the same diameter as the disc and a delicate taper angle with a high-precision clamper to correct disc warpage and distortion and to completely eliminate vibration and resonance during disc rotation. In addition, the pick-up, which is finely adjusted to the same angle as the taper angle of the turntable, enables pit reading at the center of the optical axis of the pick-up pickup.<br><br>The VDDS-20 uses an aluminum die cast for the turntable and a newly designed thick reinforced rib structure for the bridge that supports it. The mechanical base of this bridge uses a special polymer material that is molded with a polyester base mixed with glass fiber and ceramic powder. This material has an extremely low coefficient of thermal expansion and is resistant to temperature changes. It also has twice the specific gravity of ABS resin. It has excellent electrical and mechanical properties and also enables high dimensional accuracy of hardness.<br>A high-precision helicoid is used for the clamping mechanism and a high-precision, high-torque brushless Hall motor is used for the drive motor.<br><br>The turntable system is floating in a dedicated sub-chassis to minimize vibration modes.<br><br>CN servo is used for the servo circuit.<br>In general, when the servo current becomes excessive, the disturbance of the current becomes a noise component and adversely affects the analog system. In the CN servo, unnecessary noise components other than the servo current are minimized by reducing the driving voltage to the actuator with a high-quality low-pass filter.<br><br>The D/A converter uses a bit stream DAC7.<br>The VDDS-20 has a double differential mode in which two TDA1547 (DAC7) are connected to the SAA7350 for both channels. The S/N ratio is improved by eliminating interference between LRs and even-order harmonics using a differential circuit.<br>The digital filter uses a 20-bit 8 x oversampling digital filter.<br><br>The digital output is coaxial with the conventional optical output and is equipped with an ST link terminal.<br>Compared to the conventional TOS link, the ST link uses single-wavelength beams with the same phase and minimizes jitter. The VRDS-20 uses AT&amp;T&#39;s ODL-50 Series II as the ST module.<br><br>The analog output has an XLR balance output in addition to the RCA terminal.<br><br>A high-capacity transformer is used for the power supply, and devices such as carefully selected audio-only capacitors are used.<br>In addition, the digital and analog PCBs are completely separated and independent, and the symmetrical circuit design prevents interference between the circuits.<br><br>A specially selected audio-only capacitor is used in the circuit, and a precision metal film resistor is used for precision measuring equipment. This resistor has a temperature characteristic of less than 50 ppm / ℃ with a tolerance of less than ± 1%, ensuring stable operation.<br>A very thick OFC cable is used for the power cable.<br><br>A super high rigid tune chassis is used for the chassis.<br>The body is equipped with a top panel in the lower part of the bonnet to form a double top plate structure. Special non-woven fabric is sandwiched between the double top plates to enhance the vibration control effect with careful attention, and it is firmly fixed to the chassis body with 7 tentoclings.<br>The chassis body adopts separate block construction divided into 8 parts. In addition to the independent front / rear chassis, the center chassis for the mechanism is installed. It is assembled into the bottom chassis connected to the sub-chassis via two sub-chassis for the mechanism floating. In particular, the center chassis directly connected to the front / rear panel forms an H-shaped beam structure, which contributes to the rigidity of the body as a whole.<br>The VRDS mechanism and power transformer are mounted at the center of the housing, which coincides with the center of gravity of the body. By reducing the center of gravity and promoting optimum weight balance, the vibration control design is thorough. In addition, by separating the analog and digital systems into left and right through the mechanism, electrical and physical interference is eliminated.<br><br>The VRDS-20 is equipped with a heavy solid aluminum vibration control panel of 3 mm thickness 1 kg on the upper part of the bonnet, and a 3 mm thick extruded aluminum side panel reinforced with ribs on the side. This realizes a thorough vibration control structure. In addition, all eight chassis parts and screws are plated with copper to reduce the resistance of the chassis, thereby reducing eddy current loss and greatly improving strain characteristics.<br><br>Newly developed mounted insulation pole and pinpoint pole base are used for the leg part.<br>In order to further minimize unnecessary vibration of the body part, cylindrical thick aluminum extruding insulation pole is mounted at the 4 corners. This pole is equipped with a height adjustment mechanism that can be finely adjusted, and the 4 points of the body can be surely grounded.<br>The body is designed to make pinpoint contact with the pole base to attenuate vibration. This pole base has a hybrid structure consisting of aluminum, stainless steel, brass and cushion material to disperse resonance quickly. In addition, the weight ratio of aluminum to brass is 1 : 1, and hard stainless steel is used for pinpoint contact part to diffuse vibration mode.<br><br>5 mm thick solid aluminum is used for the front panel. The panel opening area is controlled by the minimum necessary switches to prevent the effect of vibration and resonance.<br>In addition, solid aluminum with gold finish is used for the tray top.<br><br>The push button is self-illuminated and has the stroke feeling and accuracy of professional machine specification.<br><br>It is equipped with functions such as random memory program, delete program, music skip, 4-mode repeat, auto-fader, 3-mode time counter, auto-space, index search, music search, display ON/OFF, timer play, etc.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
