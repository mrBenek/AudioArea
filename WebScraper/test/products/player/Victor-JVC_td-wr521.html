				<p class="detail">Twin Quick Reverse Cassette Deck capable of recording and playback on Deck 1 and Deck 2 respectively.<br><br>You can record and play back both Deck 1 and Deck 2 for long-time recording and playback. You can record the same source simultaneously on both Deck 1 and 2, and you can record continuously for three hours (two 90-minute tapes), which is convenient for air checking.<br><br>Equipped with a continuous play function.<br><br>Equipped with synchronized dubbing function, dubbing from Deck 1 to Deck 2 can be done with one touch.<br>Dubbing is equipped with two speeds, constant speed and double speed. During recording, when Deck 1 on the playback side is stopped, or when music is selected by Music Scan, Deck 2 is equipped with a synchronous recording mute function that automatically waits from recording mute state to pause state.<br>In addition, Deck 1 can be stopped at the same time as Deck 2 finishes recording, and Deck 1 can continue playing until A/B side recording of Deck 2 finishes during dubbing in round-trip mode.<br><br>The reverse mechanism uses a fine axis quick reverse mechanism.<br>In this mechanism, the recording / reproducing head and the erasing head are rotated together to improve sound quality by enabling independent adjustment of the azimuth in both forward and reverse directions and the height of the cassette half guide.<br>In addition, a quick reverse mechanism has been adopted for reverse operation on both decks 1 and 2, and an infrared sensor detects the reader tape at both ends of the cassette tape to realize quick reverse operation.<br><br>2-motor full logic + mechanical drive motor realizes quiet reverse operation.<br><br>A DC amplifier configuration is adopted in which a capacitor is removed from the circuit of the amplifier section.<br><br>Equipped with Dolby B/C NR as a noise reduction system.<br><br>Equipped with a large multi-mode display, you can check at a glance information such as a 2-color peak level meter that can check the recording level in 13 divisions from -20dB to + 10 dB, a 3-digit digital counter that can be switched to display the number of songs selected, and a mechanical mode that lets you know the.<br>A tape counter is installed on each deck 1/2 and can be displayed independently.<br><br>Both decks 1 and 2 are equipped with a Music Scan capable of tracking 9 songs in front and back.<br>With this function, the microcomputer automatically detects the unrecorded part for more than 4-5 seconds, and you can skip up to 9 songs before and after the song you are listening to.<br><br>Equipped with a sync terminal, synchronized recording is possible by connecting with VICTOR/JVC&#39;s CD player.<br><br>Equipped with auto REC mute function.<br><br>Equipped with timer start mechanism, timer playback and continuous 3 hour (90 minute 2 tapes) recording can be performed by connecting an optional timer.<br><br>Equipped with an auto tape selector that automatically detects the type of tape.<br><br>Power cord with polarity display is used.<br><br>It comes with a wireless remote control that can operate Deck 1 and Deck 2 independently.<br>This remote control is equipped with functions such as synchronized dubbing and reset of digital counter.</p>
