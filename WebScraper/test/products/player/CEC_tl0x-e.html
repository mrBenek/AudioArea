				<p class="detail">CD transport announced as the highest level of belt drive CD transport.<br><br>In order to solve the problem in the CD drive section, CEC has invested its analog player design know-how accumulated over many years to stabilize the rotational angular velocity.<br>First of all, in order to suppress the generation of vibration, a low-torque motor with greatly reduced cogging has been adopted instead of the high-torque motor conventionally used in the motor section. This allows the CD to reach the required rotational speed of approximately 500 rpm in the innermost circumference in a short time while giving effective torque when it starts rotating.<br>In addition, we focused on the minute amount of transmission per rotation during CD playback, and applied the wheel effect of a large stabilizer with a large moment of inertia to obtain a more stable rotational angle speed than conventional CD playback. Even with extremely gentle deceleration from the inner circumference to the outer circumference, stable rotational accuracy is obtained by the persistence of the wheel effect. In addition, in order to make the most of the wheel effect, time information is obtained by subcode and appropriate torque is given to the motor.<br>The linear velocity change due to the off-center component of one revolution or less is all handled by the PLL servo. Therefore, the mechanical mechanism based on the wheel effect stabilizes the macro rotation control over the entire range during music playback, and only the microscopic control of one revolution or less is handled by electronics.<br><br>The mechanism has a three point support structure made of D. R. T. S. (Double Rubbers &amp; Triple Springs) suspension and tip-toe-type insulator.<br>The mechanism chassis, which is formed into a hexagonal shape to float at three points, has a layered structure of different metals of 20 mm thick aluminum and 10 mm thick brass, and has thorough vibration control measures such as the adoption of an aluminum case that reaches 20 mm thick at the thickest part.<br><br>In order to further improve rotational accuracy, we have adopted a shaft bearing with a diameter of 5 mm that is carefully finished with ultra-precision machining technology using carefully selected and carefully selected materials.<br><br>In order to provide a clear and stable power supply at all times, the power supply section equipped with a noise filter is configured independently.<br>In addition, the control section is separated from the mechanism that can be said to be the heart of the transport. It is divided into three sections, and the control section is also separated and independent. In addition, a through-hole double-sided circuit board, which is well known for its low ground level, is adopted. These measures are taken to prevent signal distortion and degradation.</p>
