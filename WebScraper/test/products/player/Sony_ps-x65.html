				<p class="detail">A full auto player with a computer control arm.<br>There were PS-X65 with no cartridge and PS-X65C with MM type cartridge XL-25A.<br><br>It employs a computer-controlled arm that combines the electronic control of the biotracer with the conventional static balance method. This arm is equipped with a horizontal speed sensor, a position sensor and a linear motor, and the horizontal drive is controlled electronically. This has succeeded in improving the low range.<br>In addition, the operability has been improved so that it can be operated in the same way as the X75 by using logical control operation by computer and electronic inside four scan seller.<br><br>In addition to the normal auto operation, the arm can be moved freely, strict queuing by starting / stopping only the turntable, and the number of revolutions can be can be performed.<br>In addition, there is no need to touch the dust cover except for setting records, except for adjusting the needle pressure with 0 balance, such as auto record size select and electronic inside force cancel.<br><br>Equipped with a muting mechanism linked to the arm lifter.<br><br>It uses a simple linear BSL (slotless) motor that does not require a brush or slot. It eliminates the slot that causes cogging, so it achieves quiet and smooth rotation with less uneven torque.<br>In addition, high torque can be obtained due to high efficiency, and reliability and durability are also excellent.<br><br>The Magne-disk speed detection method is used to detect the speed of the servo circuit.<br>In this system, the multi-gap head detects the mean value of the detection signal that is magnetized at high density on the turntable, making it possible to catch even minute changes in the rotational speed. In addition, since the generated signal has a high frequency of approximately 284 Hz at 33 1/3rpm, servo compensation is possible up to relatively high frequencies of the flutter components.<br><br>It is equipped with a crystal lock so that the temperature characteristic of the element can ignore the effect on the detection signal.<br>By controlling the phase using the high oscillation precision of quartz crystal, stable circuit characteristics are obtained without being affected by changes in ambient temperature and power supply voltage and frequency.<br><br>In order to eliminate resonance around the tone arm, the Longs pan bearing structure, double support type chucking mechanism, and zinc-die-cast arm base are adopted to reduce harmful resonance.<br><br>The SBMC sound material is used in the cabinet, and the partial resonance is reduced by examining all aspects such as thickness and structure, and by providing reinforcement in important parts.<br>In addition, vibration is reduced by making the dust cover thick.<br><br>A gel-like dump material is enclosed in the insulator to reduce the adverse effect of vibration.</p>
