				<p class="detail">An improved CD player based on the X-1 and incorporating various technologies such as the new VRDS mechanism.<br><br>The mechanism part is equipped with a new VRDS mechanism which is a development of the original VRDS mechanism of TEAC.<br>In the VRDS mechanism, a highly precisely adjusted clamper presses the disk onto a high-mass turntable with the exact same diameter as the disk and a delicate taper angle. The clamper corrects the warpage and distortion of the disk and completely eliminates unnecessary vibration. In addition, the pick-up, which is finely adjusted to the same angle as the turntable, makes it possible to always read a minute pit in the optical axis of the pick-up.<br>The new VRDS mechanism adopted in the X-1s further enhances this mechanism and improves its quality further by reviewing various parts. First, the turntable is made of a double structure of brass + aluminum machined from conventional zinc die-cast, and resonance is eliminated by combining two different metals. In addition, the machining accuracy is improved not only on the disk crimping surface but also on all surfaces. Combined with the newly adopted 6 mm φ shaft, a precise mechanism is realized. In addition, the disk surface of the turntable machined in the micron unit is dyed in green system of the wavelength which easily absorbs the diffuse reflection of the laser light from the pickup, enabling more accurate reading.<br>In addition, this turntable employs a clamper through a high-precision helicoid to greatly reduce the resonance frequency and vibration mode, and further improve sound quality.<br><br>The drive motor of the mechanism is a high torque brushless Hall motor using a high magnetic flux density samarium-cobalt magnet.<br>In addition, zinc die-cast is used for the mechanical base and motor bearing bridge that support the entire mechanism. The bearing bridge has a newly designed reinforced rib structure that realizes twice the mass of conventional bridges. In addition to high rigidity and rotational stability, high durability and reliability are also obtained.<br><br>The pickup section uses a newly developed pick-up balance drive system, which increases the drive capability to twice that of the conventional one. In addition, a pure earth potential has been obtained. The servo circuit has also undergone further examination and is equipped with a newly developed servo circuit that minimizes the resonance of the actuator.<br><br>The mechanism section is mounted at the center corresponding to the center of gravity of the body, and unnecessary vibration is completely eliminated by low center of gravity and optimum weight balance. In addition, the analog and digital boards are separately arranged on the left and right sides to prevent mutual interference of signal systems.<br>These parts are fixed in a highly rigid double chassis for construction that is resistant to internal resonance and external vibration.<br><br>In order to resolve the distortion caused by the conversion errors of the D/A converter when the signal level is less than -60dB or when the signal changes slowly, a distortion shaper ZDII using the dither method is installed.<br>As a result, the conversion error of the D/A converter is dispersed and reduced, and a low distortion factor is realized. Moreover, a high S/N ratio is obtained by using a unique high-frequency concentrated dither.<br><br>To further improve the principle of ZDII averaging, the D/A converter employs a 1/16 shift (digital offset) small-signal oriented DAC that eliminates MSB errors that normally occur near 0 V.<br>In this DAC, by shifting the 0 v operating point of the DAC by 1/16 of the full scale, the 0 cross distortion that occurs when the input code passes through 0 v is reduced to 1/8 compared to the conventional method.<br><br>By adopting a high-precision clock oscillation circuit that boasts an average absolute frequency deviation within ± 50 ppm, high-precision time axis reproduction has been realized.<br><br>A 24K gold plated shield board is used for the digital and analog sections.<br>This PCB has excellent shielding effect and vibration absorption characteristics, and eliminates vibration and high-frequency noise that adversely affect sound quality. It is also highly stable as a material and is resistant to aging, such as oxidation, and contributes to long-term maintenance of initial performance.<br><br>We aim to further improve sound quality by introducing specially developed audio parts.<br><br>In addition to digital / analog transmission, balanced transmission is adopted for the main part.<br>By transmitting not only positive-phase signals but also negative-phase signals simultaneously, noise contamination of the ground line is cancelled.<br><br>The power transformer employs a balanced winding in which the winding is divided into two equal parts and each part has opposite phases. By canceling the magnetic field, electromagnetic noise is minimized. In addition, the parallel winding reduces accident inductance and DC resistance, and excellent regulation is obtained.<br>In addition, the earth potential is further clarified by constructing the positive and negative independent balanced power supply section that employs windings independent of the positive and negative power supply.<br><br>The front panel is made by mixing stainless steel and ceramic powder with special resin and pressing it. In addition to the excellent vibration control effect, the shield effect by weak conductivity is realized. In addition, the vibration control effect is increased by applying the newly developed micro titanium coating.<br><br>Equipped with a center window that allows you to check the disc being played.<br><br>The brightness of the FL display can be adjusted in 3 levels.</p>
