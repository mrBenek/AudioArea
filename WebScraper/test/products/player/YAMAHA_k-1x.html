				<p class="detail">Equipped with dbx and Dolby HX Pro, this cassette deck is compatible with digital sources.<br><br>Yamaha uses a low-impedance pure Sendust head made by Yamaha&#39;s proprietary high-vacuum centrifugal casting method for recording and reproducing heads.<br>In the high-vacuum centrifugal casting method, high-purity Sendust core material is produced by melting high-purity Sendust in a capsule and pressing it into a ceramic mold that rotates at high speed. In the K-1x, this pure Sendust is made into a three layer laminate structure and adopted as the core material. It has an ideal gap of 0.7 μ for playback and 2.0 μ for hexagonal symmetry, enabling recording and playback with a sufficiently low distortion and a wide dynamic range.<br>Yamaha&#39;s unique low-impedance configuration greatly improves high-frequency characteristics, phase characteristics, bias current efficiency, and separation.<br><br>An ion-plated double-gap ferrite head is used for the erasing head.<br>The K-1x, which is capable of playback at 20 kHz or higher, is coated with a 0.3 μ m glass crystal (ion plating) in order to prevent self-degaussing during playback, resulting in a decrease in recorded content.<br><br>Closed loop dual capstan system is adopted for the mechanism part.<br>In this system, the tape is driven simultaneously by two capstans on both sides of the head, so that the tension during running is always kept constant, and causes of sound quality degradation such as running unevenness, unnecessary disturbance, and noise are minimized. Resonance is also dealt with by varying the diameters of the pinch roller and capstan subtly between the supply side and the take-up side to disperse vibration frequencies.<br>In addition, thick steel plates with approximately 2.5 times the rigidity of conventional steel plates are used throughout the running system, and zinc die-cast is used for the head block to eliminate unnecessary vibration.<br>The tape drive motor is a separate drive system that completely separates the capstan, reel system, and mechanism system, thereby suppressing wow flutter and modulation noise and realizing stable driving.<br><br>ORBiT (Optimum Record Bias Tuning) is incorporated to achieve the performance of individual tapes.<br>When the bias test switch is turned ON and the REC/PAUSE and PLAY switches are turned ON, the ORBiT automatically records 1 kHz and 10 kHz signals for test recording. This signal is picked up by the playhead and sent to the comparator circuit. The result is read by the microcomputer and displayed on the ORBiT display. The bias volume is adjusted according to the result so that the optimum bias value can be set.<br>If you turn off the bias test switch after setting the bias, the tape is automatically rewound to the recording start position and stopped.<br><br>The circuit configuration of the regenerative amplifier section consists of a dual-FET differential input, direct coupling, and regenerative equalizer amplifier. In addition, Yamaha&#39;s original pure current dam method is adopted. In the pure current dam method, a constant current is always supplied from the power supply to the amplifier. No signal current flows into the ground line or power supply line. Thus, a clean power supply current can be obtained. As a result, there is no negative influence of non-linears which inevitably exist in the ground line or power supply line or non-linears inside the power supply.<br>In addition, a low-noise operational amplifier is used for the recording amplifier, and a ± power supply is used to enable recording with a wide dynamic range.<br><br>Equipped with Dolby HX-PRO which prevents degradation of characteristics by automatically adjusting bias.<br>The Dolby HX-PRO operates so that the dynamic bias is constant, greatly reducing changes in frequency characteristics due to sensitivity changes. In addition, the operation is completely independent on the left and right sides, and each side is provided with optimal bias servo.<br>Also, it works only when recording, so recorded tapes can be played on other decks without any problem.<br><br>As a noise reduction system, dbx is installed in addition to Dolby B/C.<br>With dbx, the dynamic range of the original sound is reproduced by compressing the sound signal to exactly 1/2 during recording and expanding it to 2 times during playback. In addition, the noise level is also equivalently reduced at this time so that the tape noise can be pushed out of the audible band and has a noise reduction effect of 30 to 40 dB over the entire band.<br><br>It is equipped with a master fader that controls fade in / out.<br><br>Equipped with a double-action high-speed take-up mechanism, you can take up the tape at approximately 1.5 times the normal speed by pressing and holding the switch during fast forward or rewind.<br><br>Equipped with an auto monitor function with manual switching.<br>It automatically becomes a source monitor during recording standby and recording, and automatically switches to a tape monitor when playing a tape.<br><br>It is equipped with a repeat function that allows you to listen repeatedly between any two points or all one side up to 8 times continuously.</p>
