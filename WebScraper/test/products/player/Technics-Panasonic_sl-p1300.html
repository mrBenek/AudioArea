				<p class="detail">A CD player based on the SL-P1200 with improved sound quality and operability.<br><br>The L/R-independent 4 dac configuration is used for the D/A conversion section. A dedicated D/A converter for the positive signal side and a dedicated D/A converter for the negative signal side are used for the Lch/Rch, respectively. After each component is D/A converted individually, only the part with good linearity is synthesized. In principle, 0 cross distortion, which greatly hinders the reproduction of the smile signal, is suppressed.<br>In addition, common-mode noise components are canceled out by adopting a push-pull circuit.<br><br>A silent deglitch circuit is used in the deglitch circuit to eliminate the glitch noise generated during bit switching of the D/A converter. In this circuit, the sample mode is fixed when a small signal of -12dB or less is generated. This eliminates the residual switching noise of the deglitch circuit itself, which prevents the reproduction of the small signal.<br><br>The digital filter uses an 8 x oversampling digital filter.<br>In order to further enhance the resolution of the 4DAC 18-bit conversion system, we have adopted the 266 order 8-times oversampling digital filter. As a result, the resolution is four times higher than that of the 16-bit 2-times oversampling output waveform in terms of output level and time axis, and quantization noise is greatly reduced.<br>Furthermore, the use of a third order passive low-pass filter reduces high-frequency spurious components and improves group delay characteristics.<br><br>Multi-layer structure weight base and other thorough vibration-free design.<br>A multi-layered weight base made of different materials, such as a metal chassis, special damping sheet, and TNRC, is used to prevent vibrations caused by sound pressure. The cabinet is made of a rigid integrally molded zinc die-cast structure. In addition, vibration from the floor is handled by four large insulators and a double insulator configuration of an optical deck.<br>The power transformer, which is the source of internal vibration, is floating.<br><br>It is equipped with two digital outputs, a square optical connector and 75 Ω coaxial. It also has a digital output ON/OFF terminal so that the influence of the digital output can be cut off when analog is connected.<br><br>Two unbalanced outputs (RCA pin) and a balanced output (Canon pin) are provided. One of the unbalanced outputs can be adjusted via fader. The balanced output can be either fixed or variable by switching the switch.<br><br>In order to prevent noise from other circuits into the audio circuit, the audio and digital circuits are equipped with dedicated power transformers. In addition, the Lch, Rch and headphone amplifier are wound separately to eliminate interference within the audio circuit.<br>The power supply for the audio circuit is a low-noise active servo power supply, providing a stable power supply and deep bass reproduction.<br><br>Equipped with a 2-speed search dial, precise head positioning is possible by turning the dial with the fingertips.<br><br>It is equipped with cue point standby function, and the head start position can be accurately memorized.<br>When used in combination with the Search Dial and Fader Start, you can easily perform a series of operations including determination of the cue position, confirmation, standby, and Fader Start.<br><br>Equipped with a large fader volume, you can fade in and fade out with multiple audio devices linked to the fader start.<br><br>Equipped with locking function, the pickup position can be locked in one track unit, and timing can be adjusted.<br><br>It is equipped with functions such as auto-queue, A-B repeat, and timed head-out.<br><br>A 9-digit FL multi-display is used for the display.<br>This display allows you to select and display four modes (in 0.1 second units) : the elapsed time and remaining time during performance, and the elapsed time and remaining time of all songs (program songs).<br><br>Wireless remote control with 10 keys is included.<br>This remote control is equipped with a programmable music scan function that sequentially plays only the intro part of a song.</p>
