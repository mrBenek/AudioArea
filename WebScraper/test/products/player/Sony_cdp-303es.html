				<p class="detail">An ES series CD player that inherits the basic design of CDP-302ES and further improves sound quality.<br><br>The newly developed black tapered base unit is used as the base unit for the optical system and tracking mechanism.<br>In this base unit, special plastic metal of ceramic containing powder with large internal loss is composite molded, and materials with different vibration modes are combined to reduce resonance sharpness and increase rigidity.<br>In addition to vibration control measures for the chucking arm that secures the disk to the spindle, the base unit itself has a floating structure to eliminate external vibration and improve the vibration control of the entire mechanical block.<br><br>It employs a high-speed linear motor tracking mechanism that integrates a linear motor for CD players into an optical block.<br>This enables high-speed access, which takes approximately one second from the first track to the last track on the disc.<br>In addition, since there is no conversion mechanism such as gears, the operation becomes quiet, and the foundation for eliminating unnecessary vibration in the mechanical block is solidified.<br><br>All signal processing is perfectly synchronized with one type of clock, and beat generation due to clock interference of two or more systems is eliminated in principle.<br>In addition, a digital filter is mounted to improve phase characteristics and distortion characteristics.<br><br>It is equipped with a newly developed servo circuit, and the occurrence of an error signal is detected from the signal of the most accurate main spot using a partial method, and the servo circuit is controlled by the detected data and the error signal is corrected.<br><br>In the analog circuit, the mechanical part and analog part are arranged separately, and the audio circuit is composed of LR twin mono structure to reduce interference between channels.<br>In addition, we have studied methods for wiring ground patterns and wires, and mounting circuit boards to eliminate factors that degrade sound quality.<br>We are also introducing carefully selected parts such as a wideband operational amplifier for audio.<br><br>The power supply circuit uses a ± stabilized power supply that separates digital and analog circuits.<br>We have adopted high-sound quality capacitors, including transformers that have been carefully examined even in the way the core is wound.<br><br>It is equipped with RMS function of up to 16 songs which can be enjoyed by switching in the order of favorite songs.<br><br>Four types of repeat play are available : 1 track / ALL/A ⇔ B (partial) / RMS.<br><br>It is equipped with functions such as index search function, AMS function and music search (manual search) function.<br><br>A push-loading linear skating system is adopted.<br><br>Equipped with an output variable headphone jack.<br><br>Equipped with a timer standby switch.<br><br>Uses gold-plated output jack.<br><br>Uses a oxygen-free copper power cord with polarity display.<br><br>Wireless remote control with 20 keys is included.</p>
