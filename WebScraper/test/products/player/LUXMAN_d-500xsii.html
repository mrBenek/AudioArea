				<p class="detail">This CD player has been further improved based on the technology cultivated in the D-500X&#39;s.<br><br>The mechanism uses a top-loading system to eliminate unstable structures such as trays, and the recess for disk ejection is designed to prevent turbulence, thereby eliminating unnecessary vibration.<br>In addition, the entire loading section has a floating structure and is attached to a strong base to provide a mechanism resistant to external vibration.<br><br>CDM-3, a pickup mechanism made by Philips, is used for the mechanism.<br>This mechanism employs a die-cast swing arm with a clear fulcrum, and has excellent features in principle such as mounting a focus mechanism on the die-cast frame that always traces in equilibrium with the disk according to the pantograph shape.<br>In addition, high optical performance is maintained by the single-beam system that eliminates the influence of the side beam.<br><br>The D/A converter uses the double crown mark TDA1541A, which boasts the highest level of accuracy among resistance ladders.<br>This crown mark is attached only to items that have been certified as excellent selection items, and the double crown is a lighting with excellent accuracy.<br><br>A newly designed pocket circuit board is used for the printed circuit board to reduce the influence of the printed circuit board on sound quality.<br><br>In addition to pure focus capacitors and RMA resistors, we use newly developed original parts such as electrolytic capacitors for sound quality and copper-based polystyrene capacitors with copper tubes. We also use a circuit board with a copper thickness of 70 microns, which is less resistant to heating.<br>In addition to the adoption of a copper heat sink, the bottom of the power transformer is covered with steel plates, and the top of the DAC is also clamped with thick copper plates. As a result, vibration control measures are taken to completely suppress delicate squeals.<br><br>High-purity copper wires are used for important parts of internal wiring, especially for audio systems and power supply routes, which affect sound.<br><br>In order to eliminate resonance and vibration of the chassis, the overall shape is wedge-shaped to prevent natural vibration and twisting. In addition, the influence of resonance and vibration is eliminated by using materials with excellent rigidity and vibration resistance and different vibration modes, such as fiberglass reinforced plastic for the main mechanism part, aluminum top panel of 4 mm thickness and side wood.<br>In addition, by separating the circuit board of the servo pocket, which is sensitive to vibration, from the mechanism, the influence of slight vibration is eliminated, and by structurally separating the mechanism, power supply and signal system, mutual interference is eliminated.<br>In addition, the entire chassis is copper plated.<br><br>The power supply section is equipped with a 100 VA class powerful power transformer.<br>In addition, the DAC analog amplifier section, transport section, accessory section, and display section have no dedicated windings, and each section is equipped with an independent regulator. The power supply for the analog section in particular is made clean by providing electrostatic shielding from the windings inside the transformer.<br><br>FTS is adopted, and once stored programs can be called up any number of times regardless of power ON/OFF.<br>This function can store up to 137 discs (1 disc / 5 songs).<br><br>It uses a motor drive volume that has less influence on sound quality.<br>You can check the volume level with the rotary indicator.<br><br>The output terminal is equipped with one optical digital output and two fixed / variable analog outputs.<br>A new type of highly reliable pin jack terminal is used on the rear panel, and large pin plugs can be used by expanding the interval to 18 mm pitch.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
