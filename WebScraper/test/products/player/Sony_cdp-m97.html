				<p class="detail">Mini component size CD player with 8fs18-bit D/A conversion.<br><br>The digital filter is equipped with an 8fs18-bit noise-shaping digital filter.<br>This circuit expands the distance between the audio signal and the unwanted high-frequency component by resampling the signal at 352.8 kHz, which is eight times the sampling frequency of 44.1 kHz for CD. It enables the use of a low-order low-pass filter with a gentle cut-off characteristic in the analog part after D/A conversion. This greatly improves the group delay characteristics.<br>In the CDP-M97, the digital filter performs 18-bit arithmetic operation and noise shaping, and achieves four times the resolution of 16-bit D/A conversion.<br><br>The D/A converter is equipped with a high-speed dual D/A converter.<br>In addition, the audio circuit after D/A conversion is also a twin-mono configuration that follows the signal flow, eliminating phase shift and mutual interference between channels.<br><br>Equipped with digital de-emphasis function.<br>In digital de-emphasis, the de-emphasis process conventionally composed of analog circuits is digitally processed inside the digital filter, eliminating sound quality degradation caused by parts and circuits, and achieving ideal gain and phase characteristics.<br><br>The servo circuit is equipped with S Servo III.<br>The SS Servo III, noise components that cause adverse effects are removed through a low-pass filter, and the influence on the audio circuit is reduced by sending a smooth servo current to the servo circuit. Moreover, unnecessary vibration of the optical system mechanism is also suppressed.<br><br>It is equipped with a custom edit function that combines three functions : time edit, program edit, and time fade.<br>With Time Edit, you enter the time for one side of the tape and press the Edit button to program the music to be played in order from the first song. When you encounter a time-over song, the program automatically selects the longest song within the time range. Press the Edit button once to continue the program for the A side, and press the Edit button again to continue the program for the B side. The pause is automatically inserted between the A side and the B side.<br>In program edit, you program the songs you want to put on the A side of the tape in the order you like, then press the pause button and continue to program the B side.<br>With the Time Fade function, if you set the time beforehand, the FOMA terminal automatically fades out approximately five seconds before the time and enters a pause state.<br><br>The manual fader function allows manual operation to fade in / out.<br>With this function, the fade operation takes approximately 5 seconds from where the button is pressed.<br><br>It includes custom file functionality with three functions : disk memory, custom index, and program bank.<br>With Disk Memo, when you insert a disc, a message you enter appears on the display, followed by the number of songs and the total duration of performance. You can make a note of up to 10 characters per disc. You can use 46 letters, numbers, and special symbols.<br>The custom index allows you to set an index of up to 10 points at any location on a single disk, even if no index information is recorded on the disk itself. The index set includes a rehearsal function that allows fine tuning in steps of approximately ± 0.15 seconds.<br>In the Program Bank, you can directly record a program set with the Program Performance function that can play up to 20 songs continuously. You can call up the program with the File Recall button, or you can directly bank the contents of a program set with Custom Edit.<br><br>It is equipped with a file recall function that allows you to check what files have been stored so far without having to insert a disk.<br>This allows you to check without having to insert a disk, and also to erase the file contents on the spot.<br><br>It is equipped with delete shuffle function for 99 songs.<br><br>Equipped with an auto start type multi-mode timer function, you can start from your favorite music, shuffle play and repeat.<br>By combining the custom index function, it is also possible to play the alarm clock with any phrase.<br><br>Equipped with a headphone port with volume.<br><br>Equipped with an optical digital output.<br><br>It is equipped with a program performance function of up to 20 songs, 6-mode repeat function of 1 song / whole song / part (remote control only) / program / shuffle / custom index, and auto-space function of aligning between songs in 3 seconds.<br><br>Equipped with 2-speed Music Search that enables fast forward / fast backward while listening to music.<br>Slow mode can only be operated from the remote control.<br><br>A 20-key wireless remote control is included.</p>
