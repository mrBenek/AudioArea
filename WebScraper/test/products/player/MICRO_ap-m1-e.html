				<p class="detail">This record player was developed by condensing the high-inertia concept realized in the SX 8000 II into an integrated small player and taking into consideration the design concept of the first micro CD player, the CD-M2.<br><br>In order to completely eliminate the influence of external vibration and reproduce the analog source more pure, we have developed an oil floating suspension and adopted it in the AP-M1.<br>This system consists of a high-precision floating spring with upper and lower diaphragms filled with damping oil, and a damping plate to absorb vibration. As a result, we have obtained the best howling margin in our class.<br>This suspension can be adjusted by a 3-point screw at the top of the body.<br><br>For the turntable, we have adopted a super-heavy composite double-structure turntable with a high-inertia concept, inheriting the blood line of the SX 8000 II. In order to rotate this turntable stably, we have also adopted the same control system as the SX 8000 II.<br>The structure of the motor is a motor unit with a built-in ultra-small BTL amplifier. A high-precision 8-pole synchronous motor is driven by a bi-amplifier. In addition, the precise pitch of this motor is controlled by the frequency with a CR oscillator achieve more stable rotation.<br><br>The main body of the player uses Micro&#39;s know-how over many years to implement a unique vibration control design that thoroughly examines the physical characteristics of the material.<br>First of all, the floating base is made of a new COSMAL ZMII, which is far superior to cast iron and aluminum alloys in terms of toughness and vibration control. In addition, the arm base is also made of COSMAL ZMII, which suppresses internal and external vibration and realizes excellent S/N.<br>The insulator has a three layer structure consisting of damping alloy, ferrite damping material and felt.<br>The side panel uses the same material made by Solidwood Brazilian Rose as CD-M2.<br><br>The power supply and drive circuit are completely separated and independent from the body. This method reduces the influence of flux, etc. from the power supply to the drive mechanism.<br>The drive circuit is the same as that of the SX 8000 II. By changing the motor torque between starting and playing, more stable rotation characteristics are achieved.<br>In addition, the automatic switching design enables quick start-up at 100 V at start-up and more stable driving at 50 V at constant speed, resulting in excellent start-up and smooth rotation.<br><br>In order to cancel the play caused by the slight clearance between the center hole of the disk and the spindle, a unique spindle structure is adopted.<br>By changing the tapered center spindle to a movable shaft with a combination of a spring and damping oil, misalignment is eliminated and wow flutter is reduced.<br><br>A special balanced output phono equalizer is sold separately and can be mounted on the back panel.</p>
