				<p class="detail">This cassette deck was created as a new prestige deck by refining the details of TC-K777ES.<br><br>In the TC-K777ESII, the power supply section has been thoroughly reinforced. The power transformer for the audio system and the mechanism system, which are independent, is fixed to the back panel. Moreover, the power supply for each unit is made independent and exclusive, so that a sufficient power supply is provided and mutual interference is eliminated.<br><br>The circuit configuration follows the policy of TC-K777ES. The flat amplifier for recording and playback is a DC amplifier of L/R twin mono-structure for all stages, and the head and playback amplifier are directly coupled.<br>In addition, the TC-K777ESII is designed to simplify the circuit, eliminate the cause of sound quality degradation by eliminating the relay of the signal system, and integrate the calibration circuit and meter circuit into an independent block to further simplify and straight audio transmission, reduce distortion and expand dynamic range.<br><br>The head uses an LC-OFC wound laser amorphous head that uses an LC-OFC winding in a laser amorphous head.<br>LC-OFC is made by increasing the size of the first class oxygen-free copper (purity of 99.995% or more) and reducing the number of crystal boundaries. This reduces the generation of distortion due to capacitive reactances.<br>In addition, Sony&#39;s proprietary independent suspension 3-head system provides uniform head touch to the recording head and reproducing head. At the same time, the independent structure of the recording head and reproducing head ensures accurate azimuth accuracy in the manufacturing process, resulting in higher sound quality.<br><br>The mechanism section employs a closed-loop dual capstan system. This system stabilizes the tape running around the head by arranging two sets of capstan and pinch rollers around the head. By eliminating the tape vibration transmitted from the reel, wow and flutter characteristics are improved. In addition, by shortening the span of the tape vibration, modulation noise can be expelled out of the audible band. Moreover, by obtaining a constant tape tension, uniform head touch is possible.<br>In addition, a newly developed microcomputer has been used to control the operation of the tape in addition to detailed improvements to achieve stable tape travel.<br><br>The capstan is driven by a direct drive with a quartz lock servo linear BSL motor.<br><br>The base chassis is copper-plated to prevent magnetic interference with the audio circuitry, and the die-cast head base and vibration distribution mechanism block reduce vibration transmission to the tape travel system.<br><br>It uses a newly developed Dolby IC that makes the sound quality natural when noise reduction is ON and eliminates the so-called Dolby smell.<br>In addition, LC-OFC is frequently used for signal wires.<br><br>It is equipped with a bias calibration function that allows you to precisely set the optimum recording bias value for the tape to be used within ± 20%. In addition, it is equipped with a recording level calibration function that eliminates the level difference between recording and playback due to tape sensitivity.<br>During calibration, the level meter is switched to the adjustment mode.<br><br>Equipped with a multi-functional peak program meter of double indication system that simultaneously displays peak hold and real-time peak value within 30 elements of -40dB to + 10 db on the left and right.<br><br>Equipped with a linear electronic counter that digitally displays the amount of tape travel in units of minutes and seconds (digital).<br><br>Equipped with a memory stop / play function linked to the counter.<br><br>Equipped with Dolby NR / C type and B type.<br><br>Equipped with Rec Mute function with auto space.<br><br>The timer sold separately allows continuous recording and alarm clock playback.<br><br>Equipped with two systems, a fixed output and a variable output. The variable output is an attenuator system with less impedance change and is linked to the headphone output.<br><br>Wireless remote control (sold separately) allows remote operation.</p>
