				<p class="detail">This compact, high-quality CD player is based on Sony&#39;s proprietary technology.<br><br>An optical system fixing mechanism has been adopted for the mechanism, and the optical pickup is fixed to the strong base part and the disk side is moved. This greatly reduces vibration of the pickup, and the current required for servo is limited to relatively slow movement to compensate for distortion and eccentricity of the disk, and the fluctuation of servo current is reduced.<br>In addition, a BSL motor with less rotational unevenness is used for the disk rotation motor, and sapphire with high hardness and low friction coefficient is used for the motor bearing to maintain high-precision rotational performance over a long period of time.<br><br>The CDP-X5000 uses a top-loading system to reduce the size while taking advantage of the fixed optical system. The disc is set by sliding the lid of the top panel by hand.<br>In addition, the mechanism has a unique floating structure inside, and it is mounted directly on the chassis to obtain simplicity and stable drive performance.<br><br>The servo circuit uses a high-precision digital servo, and by adjusting the servo amount of the optical pickup for each disc being played, servocontrol that more accurately reflects the disc condition is possible.<br><br>A fine drive circuit has been adopted, and the drive circuit of the pickup is composed of balanced push-pull with ± 2 power supply system capable of canceling the in-phase noise component, thereby reducing noise components from entering the earth line.<br>In addition, the digital circuit board is reduced to a minimum volume, separated from the audio circuit board, and placed on the mechanical deck to minimize the impact on the audio section.<br><br>The digital filter is a full feed-forward type digital filter.<br>This digital filter uses a 3-stage connection method with a double-type digital filter. First, complementary data is generated at the midpoint between the data obtained from the disk and the data, and the resulting data is used to create the next complementary data. In the conventional digital filter, only the high-order bits are used by rounding the low-order bits of the calculation result obtained here. However, this rounding error causes requantization noise.<br>The full-feed-forward digital filter realizes an oversampling operation that also reflects low-bit data by performing a full-feed forward (FF) operation that combines the low-bit data with the result of the next stage operation. This eliminates almost all requantization noise in the audible band, greatly improving the quality of low-level signals.<br><br>A current pulse D/A converter is used for the D/A converter.<br>In this method, a stable and clean current source is prepared, and the current pulse is generated by switching using the output of the pulse generator. This eliminates the influence of voltage fluctuations and the influence of voltage noise in the arithmetic circuit, which are problems with conventional pulse D/A converters that use voltage.<br>It also employs a complimentary service PLM that differentially synthesizes the output of the pulse D/A converter to reduce harmonic distortion.<br><br>The chassis has a mono-box structure and is designed with a combination of aluminum and steel with sufficient thickness and strength. The combination of aluminum and steel, which have different natural frequencies, cancels resonance and provides a high damping effect.<br>In addition, 10 mm thick aluminum material is used for the front panel, giving high rigidity and high-quality feeling.<br><br>An eccentric insulator is used for the legs.<br>This insulator is designed with the mounting hole offset from the center, and vibration propagation to the chassis is reduced by mutually canceling external vibration. The position and diameter of the hole are determined through repeated trial production and trial listening. This is particularly effective in attenuating mid - and high-frequency vibration components that affect audibility.<br><br>A DC servo amplifier is used in the line amplifier section. By eliminating the coupling capacitor from the signal path, the colorization characteristic of the capacitor is eliminated, and stable amplification up to the ultra-low band is possible.<br><br>A four layer glass-epoxy substrate with a four layer wiring pattern on one board is adopted. By forming the wiring pattern three dimensionally, bypassing wiring is reduced, and by shortening the signal path, it is resistant to magnetic flux and harmonic components.<br>In addition, surface mounting of parts is positively adopted, and the structure is strong against vibration such as sound pressure by eliminating lead wires and not floating parts.<br><br>An R core transformer is used for the power supply.<br>This transformer was designed based on the same design concept as the torus toroidal transformer installed in the TA-F5000 for use in low-power equipment. By making the iron core of the transformer a doughnut type with a circular cross section without any cuts, magnetic flux leakage and vibration are greatly reduced.<br><br>The digital outputs have a coaxial, optical and balanced (XLR) Route 3.<br>These outputs can be turned ON/OFF individually, and unused outputs are turned OFF to reduce the influence on the analog output.<br><br>Equipped with a custom edit function, you can control functions such as peak search, program edit, manual fader and variable fade.<br><br>Features such as custom indexes and delete banks can be manipulated with built-in custom file functions.<br><br>Equipped with functions such as shuffle play, delete shuffle, music scan, auto space, timer play (auto start), 6-mode repeat, index search, etc.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.<br><br></p>

            <p class="detail">The CDP-X5000 comes with two separate accessories for its own CD stabilizer and CD lid.<br><br>The CD stabilizer STB-A5000 is a chrome-plated brass with fluorine resin sheet processing on the disc contact surface. This stabilizer increases the volume, stability, and resolution in the low frequency range. It also reduces the loss of sound at high volume and provides an overall upgrade feeling.<br><br>The CD stabilizer STB-B5000 is made from Die-Du Pont&#39;s resin-reinforced non-material Corean. This stabilizer produces a glossy and soft sound.<br><br>The CD Lid XLD-A5000 uses resin-containing reinforced inorganic material similar to the STB-B5000. Since it is heavy and highly rigid, the sound of the Great Vengeful Spirit is less distorted, and the expressive power in large-scale music is improved.<br>In addition to the image of the standard standard, it also provides the ability to reproduce the sound field and the effect of increasing the thickness of the low range.</p>
