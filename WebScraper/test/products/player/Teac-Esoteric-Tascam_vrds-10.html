				<p class="detail">A CD player with VRDS mechanism.<br><br>The mechanism part is equipped with TEAC&#39;s original VRDS (Vibration-Free Rigid Disc-Clamping System).<br>In the VRDS, the disk is attached to a high-mass turntable with the same diameter as the disk and a delicate taper angle with a high-precision clamper. The disc is fixed to correct warpage and distortion of the disc, and vibration and resonance during rotation of the disc are eliminated. In addition, the pickup, which is finely adjusted to the same angle as the taper angle of the turntable, makes it possible to always read the pit at the center of the optical axis of the pickup.<br>The VDDS-10 uses a high-mass, high-density aluminum die cast for the turntable, and a newly designed thick-walled reinforced rib structure for the bridge that supports it. The mechanical base of this bridge uses a special polymer material that is molded with a polyester base mixed with glass fiber and ceramic powder. It has an extremely low coefficient of thermal expansion and is resistant to temperature changes. It has a specific gravity approximately twice that of ABS resin, has excellent electrical and mechanical properties, and achieves high dimensional accuracy.<br>The clamping mechanism uses a high-precision helicoid that boasts ultra-quiet operation. In addition, the entire turntable system is floated in a dedicated sub-chassis to minimize vibration modes, and excellent sound quality is obtained over all bands.<br>In addition, a high-precision, high-torque brushless Hall motor is used in the drive mode to improve the rotational stability of the turntable and realize high durability.<br><br>The D/A converter uses DAC7, a bit stream conversion.<br>The VRDS-10 uses the SAA7350, an excellent audio device, and the TDA1547 &quot;DAC7&quot; in a double-differential mode with two joints for both channels to enhance sound purity and transparency. The differential circuit also eliminates L/R interference and even-order harmonics, further improving the S/N ratio.<br><br>The digital filter is equipped with a 20-bit 8 x oversampling digital filter.<br><br>A large-capacity transformer is installed in the power supply section, and a specially selected audio-only capacitor is used.<br>In addition, the digital and analog PCBs are completely separated and independent, and symmetrical circuit design prevents interference between left and right circuits.<br><br>A specially selected audio-only condenser is used in the circuit, and a precision metal film resistor used in precision measuring equipment is used for the resistor. The tolerance of the resistor is less than ± 1% with temperature characteristics of 50 ppm / ℃.<br><br>Balanced transmission is used for digital / analog transmission and the main part of the circuit. By transmitting not only positive-phase signals but also negative-phase signals simultaneously, noise contamination of the ground line is cancelled.<br><br>The CN servo is used for the servo mechanism that controls the delicate operation of the pickup.<br>In general, when the servo current for control becomes excessive, the disturbance of the current becomes a noise component and affects the analog system. To prevent this, in the CN servo, the driving voltage to the actuator is reduced by a high-quality low-pass filter to reduce unnecessary noise components other than the servo current.<br><br>The center mount system is used for the chassis layout to achieve low center of gravity and minimum weight balance by mounting the heavy VSRDS and power transformer at the center of the chassis that matches the center of gravity. In addition, the analog and digital systems are separated to the left and right to eliminate electrical and physical interference.<br>The body uses a double-top panel structure with a top panel in the lower layer of the bonnet. Nonwoven fabric is sandwiched between the double-top panels to enhance mental effects. This is firmly fixed to the chassis body to the chassis body by 7-point fasteners.<br><br>The chassis body uses a separate block construction divided into eight parts. In addition to the separate front and rear chassis, there is a center chassis for the mechanical system. The chassis is rigidly assembled into a bottom chassis connected to the side chassis via two sub-chassis for mechanical floating. The center chassis, which is connected directly to the front and rear panels, forms a beam structure, which greatly strengthens the entire body.<br><br>The front panel is made of 5 mm thick aluminum, and the panel opening area is controlled by the minimum necessary switches to prevent the effect of vibration and resonance.<br>In addition, the tray top gold finish is used for the tray top.<br><br>It is equipped with functions such as random memory program, delete program, music skip, 4-mode repeat, auto-fader, 3-mode time counter, auto-space, index search, music search, display ON/OFF, timer play, etc.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
