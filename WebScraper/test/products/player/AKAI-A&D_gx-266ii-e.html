				<p class="detail">This is an open deck with further improved performance and functions while maintaining the symmetrical mechanism established in the GX 266 d.<br><br>A new CPG built-in AC servo motor is used for the capstan drive motor.<br>This is a newly developed motor with a built-in sample-and-hold circuit that has excellent servo characteristics and virtually no motor vibration. It reduces flutter components, which cause muddy sound in both directions, and greatly improves tape start-up characteristics.<br>Combined with the 3-motor DD system, in which special motors are used for feeding and winding, excellent wow and flutter characteristics are realized.<br><br>The head is equipped with a new GX head which is a further development of the AKAI GX head.<br>By making the tip of the head core a compound R-shape, the contour effect has been thoroughly improved, the waviness in the low range has been eliminated, and the shield between tracks has been strengthened, and low crosstalk has also been achieved successfully.<br>Even with a 6-head configuration, the tape path is short, and it is a slim type that allows clear recording and playback. It has excellent characteristics in all aspects such as high-frequency characteristics, distortion rate, abrasion resistance, and dust adhesion.<br><br>The symmetrical mechanism, including a center capstan located at the center of the head block and six heads arranged symmetrically, realizes uniform recording and playback characteristics in both directions.<br><br>The tape path by the center capstan, the one way dump tension arm, the logic circuit to control the tape movement, the unique polyester band brake and the mirror finish new GX head make the tape travel smooth.<br>This makes it possible to use not only double-play tapes (200% type) but also ultra-thin triple-play tapes (300% type).<br><br>Tape running mode can be switched to 3 stages of one way or one round trip recording / playback and repeat playback.<br><br>It is equipped with a 2-position tape selector, the bias is fixed to the optimum value, and the circuit design adjusts the recording equalizer.<br><br>Equipped with timing lamp auxiliary sound mute mechanism. It is an effective function for cutting CM and narration in FM air check. The timing lamp blinks during muting or at about 1 second intervals and tells you the time.<br><br>Equipped with a large VU meter.<br><br>Separate circuits are used for microphone input and line input.<br><br>The input and output knobs are equipped with memory markers with friction stops that can be adjusted immediately to the preset level.<br>Useful for fade-in and fade-out operations such as air check, dubbing, line and microphone mixing, etc. You can easily and accurately reset to the optimum level.<br><br>For smoother long play, the time lag during reverse is shortened.<br>By taking advantage of the start-up characteristics of the motor and thoroughly pursuing the operation timing of each circuit and mechanism, quick motion with a reverse time of 2 to 2.5 seconds is realized.<br><br>Equipped with pitch control, you can fine-tune the tape speed up to ± 6%.<br><br>It is equipped with a monitor switch for recording check, a mode switch for monaural recording, a quick pause mechanism, and a direction and standby lamp that let you know the tape running direction at a glance.<br><br>Timer connection allows recording of absence and playback of alarm clock.<br>When an alarm clock is played using a timer, it can be played automatically and repeatedly in either direction from normal to reverse or from reverse to normal. Also, it can be played endlessly throughout the day by just setting it once.<br><br>Detachable Head cover.<br><br>By connecting a separately sold remote control unit, it can be operated from a distance.</p>
