				<p class="detail">Metal tape compatible cassette deck with Super GX head.<br><br>The newly developed twin field type Super GX combination head is adopted for the recording / reproducing head.<br>This head uses newly developed High and High μ ferrite materials, and adopts a twin field structure for the first time in the world.<br>The twin field structure functionally separates the two field systems of the recording field system and the reproducing field system. Although it is a read / write head, it is designed to provide the same performance as a 3-head type by setting the recording gap (4 μ) and the reproducing gap (1 μ).<br>The newly developed head material used has excellent material characteristics such as low eddy current loss. The recording gap is wide enough to handle metal tapes with high coercive force. The playback gap can also be set optimally to achieve excellent playback frequency characteristics. Like the GX head, it also has excellent secondary characteristics such as abrasion resistance and dust retention compared to metal heads such as permalloy and Sendust.<br><br>A double-gap ferrite head using newly developed High ferrite material is used for the erasing head.<br>It has high erasing efficiency and is compatible with metal tapes with high coercive force.<br><br>It is equipped with IPLS (Instant Program Locating System) as an automatic cue function.<br>In IPLS, the playhead detects the boundary between the signal and non-signal portions of the tape and automatically enters the play state by pressing the IPLS button and simultaneously pressing the RWD / FF lever and the PLAY lever.<br>This function is activated when there is no signal for more than 4 seconds.<br><br>Equipped with a 4-position tape selector, it can switch 4 positions of LN (low noise), LH (low noise high output), CrO2 (chrome or SA) and METAL to one touch.<br>In addition, the bias fine adjustment knob is provided for each position, and the bias amount can be changed by ± 10% for each position.<br><br>Equipped with a digital FL meter using a fluorescent display tube.<br>This meter can be used as both a VU meter and a peak meter by switching the switch. The optimum recording level is estimated to be 0 dB for the VU meter and + 8 dB for the peak meter.<br><br>The input circuit of microphone and line is independent, and mixing recording is possible.<br>The line input goes directly to the line volume and the microphone input goes through the microphone amplifier and into the microphone volume, so that the line input does not pass through the microphone amplifier and does not pick up any excess noise.<br><br>Equipped with auto-play function, it is possible to auto-play which automatically enters into regenerating condition at the tape end by pressing the RWD lever and Play lever simultaneously.<br>It is also equipped with a memory play function so that you can listen repeatedly by setting the head of the song you want to listen repeatedly to the number 000 on the counter.<br><br>It is equipped with a recording mute function, so you can make a silent recording part without changing the recording state.<br>While this mechanism is in operation, the signal on the tape is not recorded, but the source can be monitored as is.<br><br>Equipped with a Dolby NR system as a noise reduction system.<br><br>Equipped with AKAI&#39;s own ADR system.<br>In this method, the recording equalizer automatically adjusts according to the frequency band and level of the input signal to prevent distortion due to demagnetization in the high-frequency range. This makes it possible to record in the high-frequency dynamic range.<br><br>Equipped with timer standby mechanism, recording of absence and alarm clock playback are possible by combining the timer.<br><br>Equipped with electronic auto-stop mechanism.<br>When the tape has finished running, the stop of the take-up reel is detected electronically and the STOP lever is released.<br><br>It is equipped with a monomic mechanism. When one microphone is connected to the L-channel jack, the signal is automatically distributed to the R-channel as well, making it possible to use the center microphone for vocals.</p>
