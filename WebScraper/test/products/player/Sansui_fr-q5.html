				<p class="detail">Quartz Servo DD player with built-in computer full auto mechanism.<br><br>Computer LSI is used for the electronic circuit of the full auto mechanism.<br>In this system, an arm position sensor and a lifter position sensor composed of LED and phototransistor are provided in the mechanism section, and the arm and arm lifter are controlled by computer LSI by inputting these sensors. During full-auto operation, the position of the arm and arm lifter, record size setting, repeat, etc. are repeatedly checked through these sensors, and the next signal is output to enable quick and accurate operation.<br>The end groove counts the time between one pulse of the arm position sensor with a pulse counter, and reads even a slight difference of 33 and 45 rpm. When the set time and pulse width are confirmed, the arm is judged to be running in the end groove of the record and the end operation is started. When the repeat instruction is given, the arm is carried to the set point of the record which can be detected by the arm position sensor, and the arm does not return to the arm rest but lead-in.<br>This mechanism is designed to give priority to stopping. It immediately enters the stop operation at any position of the full auto, so there is no worry of damaging the needle of the cartridge.<br><br>The full-auto mechanism is equipped with a special motor to enable accurate operation.<br>In addition, the arm and the mechanism are separated by a disk clutch, so it is designed to be contact-free so that it is not affected by the mechanism during tracing.<br><br>The Dynaoptimum Balanced arm is used for the tone arm. In this method, in addition to the conventional mass concentration method, the optimum support point theory is adopted. The pivot position of the arm is set to the optimum position for dynamic balance. This prevents vibration of the pivot part from being transmitted to the cartridge and at the same time prevents unnecessary vibration from the needle tip from being transmitted to the pivot part, making excellent tracing possible.<br><br>A 20-pole 30-slot quartz servo motor is used for the drive motor of the turntable section. By rotating in synchronization with the accurate oscillation frequency, accurate rotational accuracy is achieved without being affected by power supply voltage, temperature, humidity, etc.<br>In addition, in order to control the rotation speed of the motor at an accurate speed, we have adopted a newly developed magnetic recording detection system in the speed detection part of the servo system. In this system, 960 pulse signals are magnetized around the turntable inner circumference, and the detection head detects pulses corresponding to the rotation, thereby servo the rotation of the motor. When the PLL of this servo circuit is locked, the angle is 0.375 °, and it is locked and controlled within 1 mm of the turntable outer circumference. Thus, high-precision rotation is realized. As soon as the switch is turned on, the rotation is quickly shifted to constant speed, and the strobe does not fluctuate.<br>The PLL circuit uses an electronic circuit including a highly reliable IC.<br><br>Equipped with an electronic brake, switching from 45 rpm to 33 rpm instantly enters constant speed rotation, and when stopping, the turntable quickly stops.<br><br>Switches are installed on the front and all operations are possible with the dust cover closed.<br><br>Uses cartridges made by Empire.<br><br>It has a strobe on the front for better visibility with bright lighting.<br><br>The cabinet uses a silver metallic cabinet that is resistant to howling, and the legs use newly developed insulators.<br><br>Uses a turntable sheet with good record adhesion.<br><br>Uses a new type of acrylic dust cover.<br><br>Equipped with a pivot protection mechanism, even if the arm is locked to the arm rest and started by mistake, the safety device will work after 20 seconds and stop the automatic operation.<br>In addition, the special spring protects the pivot of the arm from damage even when the arm is locked to the arm rest.</p>
