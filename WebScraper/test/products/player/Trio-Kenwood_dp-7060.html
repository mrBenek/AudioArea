				<p class="detail">A CD player equipped with a D. R. I. V. E system with improved reproducibility of minute signals.<br><br>Equipped with the D. R. I. V. E. (Dynamic Resolution Intensive Vector Enhancement) system, which was developed using original signal processing technology, to improve digital processing of music signals from small level to near silence.<br>The conventional digital filter aims to remove unnecessary components outside the audible band included in the original digital signal. It can smoothly output low-level abnormal signals with a 20-bit resolution in the calculation process. However, it could not obtain sufficient effect in the region below the low-level, and it could only obtain output close to the original 16-bit signal.<br>To solve this problem, the D. R. I. V. E. system uses real-time processing (a technique that processes all music signals instantaneously) using adaptive filter technology to improve micro-level reproducibility and responsiveness to impulsive sounds such as attack sounds.<br>The D. R. I. V. E. processor is located between the 8 x Oversampling &amp; 20 x digital filter and the 20-bit data input D/A converter. It is processed so that the output from the digital filter is always 20-bit accurate even in the range where only 16-bit accuracy can be obtained.<br>The internal section consists of a low-pass filter and a delay unit with cutoff frequencies within different audible frequency bands. The delay unit adjusts the amount of delay generated by the low-pass filter. Data from the digital filter is distributed from the input terminal, input to each delay unit, and then input to each LPF. Next, a selector control circuit constantly detects the frequency component and level of the input data and selects the optimum LPF output.<br>This makes it possible to drive the D/A converter with 20-bit accuracy at all times.<br><br>The D/A converter uses a bit stream 1-bit D/A converter (DAC7) with excellent differential linearity.<br>High signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) is obtained by adopting the PDM method in which the 1-bit pulse density is changed according to the CD data. This PDM waveform accurately drives the switched-capacitor integrator placed at the later stage.<br>The 1-bit D/A converter is a method for restoring analog signals by converting level-axis information into time-axis density. It requires an external clock with high accuracy. However, by using an advanced high-precision master clock as the master clock, accurate operation is obtained.<br><br>An advanced high precision master clock is used as the master clock.<br>This oscillation circuit uses a discrete circuit to obtain a high-purity clock signal. This circuit is based on a Source Follower circuit and has a characteristic of gain less than 1, so it oscillates an accurate reference signal without amplifying external noise.<br><br>SuperC developed for Kenwood&#39;s high-end L-series<sup>4</sup>Is used for the audio stage.<br>This circuit employs a high-precision differential amplifier circuit with a high common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR) in the first stage circuit, which is susceptible to noise. This circuit achieves purer signal amplification by preventing noise contamination.<br><br>Equipped with an accurate linear focus servo.<br>By controlling the pickup actuator so that the optimum DC servo voltage is applied in the direction that follows the appropriate levitation voltage even if it changes, stable operation is always achieved.<br><br>Digital servo, digital / analog separate winding, OEIC pickup, 1.6 mm thick steel chassis, etc. are adopted.</p>
