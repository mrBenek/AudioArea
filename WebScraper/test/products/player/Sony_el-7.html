				<p class="detail">An el-cassette deck, which is the highest open-reel machine of 3-motor 3-head configuration.<br><br>In order to reduce modulation noise and obtain stable head touch, we have adopted a closed-loop dual capstan system in which the tape is sandwiched between two pairs of capstan and pinch rollers and driven.<br>The tape vibration is suppressed just before the head, and at the same time, the vibration between the capstan and the capstan is pushed out of the audible band. Moreover, the effect of external load fluctuation does not affect between the capstan and the capstan, so that stable head touch is always obtained.<br><br>Capstan motors are equipped with frequency servo motors with FG.<br>Servocontrol is performed by directly connecting an FG (frequency-generator) to the rotating shaft of the motor and detecting the rotational speed deviation based on the generated frequency change. This structure makes it less susceptible to electrical fluctuations in the circuit. Even if the voltage fluctuates due to temperature rises, the oscillation frequency hardly changes and the rotational speed remains stable.<br>In addition, for rewind and fast-forward operations, a 3-motor configuration using a coreless motor with good start-up characteristics is adopted. Since no complicated transmission mechanism is required, high precision, high stability, and high durability are realized.<br><br>By replacing the three recording / playback / erasing heads with dedicated heads, we have achieved excellent recording / playback characteristics.<br>A solid-core all-ferrite F &amp; F head is used for the recording / reproducing head, which uses a single layer of ferrite not only for the core part but also for the guard part. As a result, the phase and frequency characteristics are improved.<br>We have also improved the S / N ratio, frequency characteristics, and distortion factor by adopting a direct coupling method that directly connects the F &amp; F head and the reproducing amplifier using FET.<br><br>Equipped with Dolby NR.<br>In addition, a 400 Hz calibrator is installed to handle the different recording sensitivity of each tape, which is a problem in Dolby recording. This test signal can be used to adjust the sensitivity for more accurate Dolby recording.<br><br>In order to prevent malfunction of the Dolby NR circuit with 19 kHz pilot signal during FM air check, an MPX filter is mounted to cut the pilot signal.<br><br>Equipped with a memory stop play function.<br>When the memory switch is set to the STOP position, rewinding stops at the counter 999 position. When the memory switch is set to the START position, the memory switch automatically enters the regenerating condition after rewinding.<br><br>Equipped with a 3-step switching type tape selector independent of bias and equalizer.<br><br>Continuous recording is possible by using the separately sold program timer.<br>This operation is realized by logical control which performs all operation of the mechanism by electromagnetic solenoid.<br><br>The front panel is equipped with a stereo line-in jack.<br>This input terminal has priority over the line input on the rear panel.<br><br>Equipped with a 15 db and 30 db 2-stage switching type microphone attenuator.<br><br>The microphone input volume and line input volume are dedicated respectively, and the input circuit is also separated.<br>This prevents the line input from passing through the microphone amplifier, so that the dynamic range of the line input is not affected and mixing is possible.<br><br>In a regenerating condition, press the Record button while pressing the Play button to instantly change to the recording mode. Recording can be performed later.<br><br>Both ends of the leader tape of the L Cassette are transparent, and the light of the lamp placed between the tape is caught by the phototransistor to realize a reliable auto stop.<br><br>A master volume with preset is installed.<br><br>Equipped with an independent headphone volume.<br><br>Equipped with a large VU meter.<br><br>Equipped with safety lock mechanism.<br><br>Uses a soft eject mechanism.<br><br>You can use the wired remote control (sold separately) to perform operations from a remote location or Rec-Mute.</p>
