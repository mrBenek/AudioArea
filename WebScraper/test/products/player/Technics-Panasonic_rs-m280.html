				<p class="detail">This stereo cassette deck was developed to integrate Technics&#39;s cassette deck technology.<br><br>3-motor double capstan drive system is adopted for the mechanism part.<br>A flat-faced D. D. motor has been adopted for the capstan. This motor is based on the flat-faced D. D. motor adopted for RS-M85 and has been further improved. It is directly connected to the capstan on the take-up side and drives the capstan directly. At the same time, the capstan on the take-out side is also driven with high precision. The two capstan with a precision finish of 0.1 micro roundness are designed with a small difference in diameter. By obtaining an appropriate back tension, excellent running performance and stable head touch are realized.<br>DC motors are used for reel drive and ff/rew respectively.<br><br>A quartz phase-locked direct drive system is adopted, and the output from the FG (frequency oscillator) built into the flat opposed type D. D. motor is detected all around, and the rotation is strictly controlled by comparing it with the accurate reference frequency by quartz oscillation.<br><br>The quartz control unit integrated on the printed circuit board on the rear face of the drive block has newly adopted the chip mounting method. As much as possible, chip-mounted elements are directly connected to the print pattern, ensuring high reliability and space saving.<br><br>SX Sendust combination head with laminated Sendust as head material is used for recording and reproducing head.<br>It has a オンビ Nation Head configuration in which the optimum gap for recording and playback can be selected independently. By storing two heads in one case, the in-line connection between the heads (single row), which is a problem in a 3-head system, becomes perfect. It also has excellent azimuth (vertical) characteristics, so there is no worry high-frequency degradation or phase shift between channels.<br><br>The erasing head uses Sendust, which has high saturation magnetic flux density and excellent wear resistance, for the surface layer, and uses a double-gap Sendust ferrite head made of ferrite material with low high-frequency loss for other parts.<br><br>Equipped with a digital tape counter, the counter is displayed by 3-digit numbers and 4 bars.<br><br>Equipped with a Total Operation Monitor, it displays the tape position set by the Auto Tape Selector, monitor status, and where each of the Dolby NR (in or out) and MPX filter (in or out) is set.<br><br>Equipped with 2-color FL display with auto reset peak hold.<br><br>Equipped with an auto tape selector, it detects the type detection hole on the back side of the cassette half and automatically sets it to the optimum position. Also equipped with a 2-position manual switch for tapes without detection holes.<br><br>Equipped with a test tone oscillator, the level can be adjusted by two independent frequencies of 400 Hz and 8 kHz.<br><br>Equipped with a Rec Cal Volume, it can compensate for variations in sensitivity and characteristics of the tapes used.<br><br>Equipped with a bias fine adjustment function that can set the optimum bias current value according to the type of tape.<br>Can vary from -50% to + 100% of the reference current.<br><br>It is equipped with an MPX filter that cuts the harmful 19 kHz pilot signal during FM air check.<br><br>Equipped with a 3-head double system Dolby NR as a noise reduction system.<br><br>The control section is equipped with a microprocessor with approximately 15,000 elements in one chip.<br>This allows you to control all functions such as tape running (recording, playback, fast-forward, rewind, pause, etc.), recording / playback amplifier switching, rec mute, mute audio section, digital tape counter, memory repeat, remote control, etc.<br><br>Equipped with 2-mode / 6-type computer memory function, if you press the reset button of the digital electronic counter at any position on the tape to set the counter to 000, you can perform various operations from that point.<br>First of all, in the memory repeat mode, it is possible to repeat between 000 positions from the beginning of the tape, to repeat automatically from 000 positions to the end of the tape, and to repeat automatically throughout a roll by attaching 000 to the beginning of the roll of the tape.<br>In Memory Stop Mode, you can play from the beginning and stop at position 000, fast-forward from the beginning and stop at position 000, rewind from the end and stop at position 000.<br><br>It is possible to directly change from ff/rew to play by computer logic method with microcomputer.<br><br>By connecting an audio timer (sold separately), you can start recording and rerecording at the desired time by controlling the timer start switch.<br><br>Computer fail-safe protects the mechanism and tape from adverse effects such as direct change from ff/rew to play and memory system off function for recording.<br>Also, when you set the recording mode, pressing the Record button automatically turns the pause on.<br><br>Equipped with a source ⇔ tape monitor switch, the monitor during recording can be switched between source input from the line / microphone and tape with one touch operation, enabling real-time sound comparison.<br>This switch is located in the sealing pocket and the operation indicator shows the status.<br><br>Equipped with a transparent lamp that can read the light inside the cassette holder and the remaining amount of tape.<br><br>Equipped with an auto tape string mechanism and equipped with a newly developed mechanism to string (stretch) the tape relaxed in the half. It operates automatically when the tape is set and the holder is closed.<br><br>Operation from a remote location is possible by using the separately sold remote controller.<br><br>There are 2 kinds of designs, silver and black.</p>
