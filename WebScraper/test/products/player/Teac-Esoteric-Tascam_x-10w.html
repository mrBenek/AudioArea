				<p class="detail">This is a CD-player that combines the VRDS mechanism of Eso Telik with the DAC of Wadia Inc.<br><br><br>The D/A converter is equipped with a differential balance D/A circuit developed by Wadia exclusively for the VRDS mechanism.<br>In this circuit, the digital signal read by the VRDS mechanism is resampled by a factor of 8 in a digital filter. The 18-bit DAC is then converted to 19-bit resolution using a programmable gate array made by Xilinx, Inc. of the United States. At the same time, the 8 x DAC is processed by a factor of 2 to 16 x DAC. The gate array also operates a sine wave moving average circuit to minimize conversion errors.<br>Wadia&#39;s know-how has been fully applied to the DAC usage and substrate layout that maintain the time axis accuracy of these digital processing units.<br>The balanced output of the 4 dac is delivered directly to the XLR connector without passing through an analog filter. This is a high-definition specification.<br><br>It is equipped with a sine wave moving average circuit which is also installed in D-3.<br>When performing further over-sampling after 8 times over-sampling, a simple moving average results in a linear interpolation, resulting in a significant error from the original signal. The sine wave moving average circuit installed in the X-10w realizes 12/24 over-sampling by placing an interpolation value on the sine wave, thereby minimizing phase distortion in the analog interpolation in the latter stage.<br><br><br>The VRDS mechanism is used for the mechanism part.<br>In this mechanism, the disk is securely clamped on a high-mass turntable with the same diameter as the disk, and the inherent vibration of the disk itself and unnecessary vibration of the mechanism system are completely eliminated. In addition, warpage and distortion of the disk are corrected by giving an extremely gentle inclination to the disk crimping surface. The pickup, which is finely adjusted to the same angle as the inclination angle of the turntable, always realizes pit reading at the center of the pickup optical axis. This has succeeded in greatly improving the relative optical axis accuracy between the optical pickup and the disk pit surface, and minimizes unnecessary servo current.<br>These greatly reduce disk read errors and prevent timing errors (jitter) in the clock circuit.<br><br>In the X-10w VRDS mechanism, high-precision die-cast aluminum is used for the turntable, supported by a bridge with thick reinforced rib structure.<br>The mechanical base is made of a special polymer material that has a low coefficient of thermal expansion and resistance to temperature changes. This material has twice the specific gravity of ABS resin. Not only is it excellent in electrical and mechanical properties, it also contributes to high dimensional accuracy.<br>The motor uses a brushless Hall motor that boasts high torque to provide rotational stability and high durability. Furthermore, the entire turntable mechanism is floated with a copper-plated sub-chassis to reduce vibration modes.<br><br><br>The power supply unit and the power transformer for the D/A unit are placed outside the rear panel to prevent the influence of flux on the mechanical control system. The dedicated circuit board for the power supply unit is designed to have an optimum layout in terms of circuitry and structure to ensure high quality.<br><br>In order to take full advantage of the all-in-one CD player, the digital output circuit is omitted and sound quality is more important than function.<br><br>The chassis structure is a double structure with copper plated main &amp; sub chassis.<br>In addition to an independent sub-chassis supporting the VRDS mechanism, it uses a box structure in which the D/A section and servo system are separated and independent. In addition, to electrically shield each stage, copper plated steel plates for the inner chassis are constructed with diamond structure.<br>The front panel, side panel and top panel are damped using 10 mm thick heavyweight aluminum extruding material to prevent natural vibration and resonance.<br><br>Uses a pin-point foot of hybrid structure for the leg part.<br>This is a hybrid structure that combines a brass block with a stainless steel pin. It is supported by 3 points, 2 points in the front and 1 point in the rear for optimum mechanical grounding.<br>In addition, the pin-point base is made of machined aluminum material to give an appropriate loss. This makes the supporting point and moving point of vibration clear and prevents ambiguous resonance. In addition, the center of gravity is laid out at the center of a triangle connecting three points, giving an emphasis on sound quality.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
