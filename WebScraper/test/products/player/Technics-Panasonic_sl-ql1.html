				<p class="detail">A linear tracking player that pursues performance and functions with the introduction of electronics technology.<br><br>The linear tracking arm has the advantage that tracking error, which causes distortion, and inside force, which causes imbalance between channels, can be very close to 0 because the needle tip moves linearly on the record board.<br>The SL-QL1 is equipped with a compact high-precision linear tracking tone arm inside the upper cabinet, and achieves excellent needle point traceability by accurate movement.<br><br>The arm deflection angle, which is the running condition of the linear tracking arm, occurs as the cartridge moves.<br>The deflection angle detection mechanism of the SL-QL1 uses an optical sensor (optical non-contact detection) and microcomputer control to achieve high running accuracy. Unlike the detection at the bearing section, the deflection angle detection is performed near the tip of the cartridge needle, so that the tracking groove tracking ability of the cartridge is controlled in an ideal state. The tracking error angle is within ± 0.1 ° and the inside force is almost 0. Thus high running accuracy is achieved.<br>In addition, a DC motor with extremely high rotational accuracy and excellent servo response is used for the motor for driving the arm travel. In addition, the arm travel uses a slide bearing with an extremely low friction coefficient, and the use of ball bearings and rollers realizes quiet and smooth arm travel without unnecessary vibration.<br><br>The tone arm of SL-QL1 uses a unique dynamic balance system in which the center of gravity is aligned with the center of rotation axis of the arm. This system eliminates the need for precise horizontal adjustment or needle pressure adjustment, making it possible to play a stable and balanced record.<br><br>The arm bearing structure adopts a high-sensitivity gimbal suspension bearing structure with 4-point support system using pivot and ball bearing, and high initial motion sensitivity is obtained in both horizontal and vertical directions.<br>In addition, the arm, including the cartridge, is a low-mass design with an effective mass of only 9g. Combined with the gimbal suspension bearing structure, it realizes a stable race performance against sleds and underlays of records.<br><br>The cartridge is equipped as standard with a MM cartridge that adopts Technics&#39;s original pure boron pipe cantilever.<br>By adopting a pure boron pipe cantilever, which is refined only with pure boron, which has an extremely high specific elastic modulus among existing elements, the vibrator has a light effective mass, and high resonance frequencies are pushed out of the range of audibility.<br>In addition, high-frequency attenuation is minimized by adopting a multi-layer all-laminate core in the magnetic circuit. In addition, wide-band, low-distortion reproduction and excellent trace performance are realized by adopting a high-energy samarium-cobalt magnet and a one point suspension with a clearly defined vibration support point.<br><br>A unique plug-in connector method is used for connection to the tone arm.<br>In this plug-in type, the resonance peak is set at 12 Hz from the design stage to obtain more ideal trace performance. In addition, poor contact and misconnection between the cartridge terminal and the arm terminal due to lead wire connection are eliminated. Since the terminal is not exposed, performance degradation is less and reliability of the connection is improved. In addition, since it is locked with a fixing screw, imperfect connection and partial resonance are prevented.<br>In SL-QL1, MC type replacement cartridge 310 mc and P-205Cmk3 can be used.<br><br>The drive part uses a unique integrated structure D. D. that integrates the rotor of the motor with the turntable in pursuit of mechanical accuracy.<br>The motor employs a current-controlled full-wave drive type flat-faced slotless D. D. motor that improves the S / N ratio and reduces wow and flutter. This method improves rotational performance without deterioration caused by variations in the performances of the Hall elements for position detection. In addition, to prevent torque efficiency from decreasing due to the slotless design, a unique coil structure with two layers of coils is adopted. This design has high efficiency equivalent to the work of six split coils.<br>In addition, high rotational performance has been achieved by means of Technics&#39;s proprietary F. G. all-around detection and quartz control that achieves excellent rotational accuracy through electronic circuit technology.<br><br>The SL-QL1 is equipped with a 4-bit one chip microcomputer, MN1400. This MN1400 performs all automatic operations except power on/off. The microcomputer is also used not only for the full automatic mechanism but also for controlling the Quartz D. D. motor, controlling the arm drive motor, and detecting whether the cabinet is open or closed.<br><br>It is equipped with a simple electronic control full auto mechanism that consolidates all operations into four keys.<br>When a record is set and the start key is pressed, the rotation speed and record size are automatically detected and set. After the performance, the arm automatically returns to the arm rest and the turntable stops.<br>The rotation speed can be set regardless of the record size, and this manual rotation speed setting is canceled when the dust cover is opened.<br>When no record is set, the function does not operate even if the start key is pressed, preventing malfunction.<br><br>The start and stop keys have a search function that allows you to move the tone arm forward and backward to locate the beginning of a song in the middle of middle of a record.<br><br>To enjoy repeated performances, a repeat key is installed.<br>In the case of release, if you press the stop key, the arm returns together with the repeat release and the turntable stops.<br><br>Up / down of the arm can be operated by the queuing key.<br>Since it is equipped with a muting function using relay and delay circuit, the noise which is a concern at the moment when the needle tip touches the surface of the record board and the moment when it leaves is eliminated.<br><br>Both the upper and lower parts of the cabinet are made of precision aluminum die-cast, and TNRC with excellent vibration absorption is adopted for the bottom base.<br>In addition, as a measure against external vibration, we have adopted an insulator that combines rubber and spring.<br><br>Other than silver, there was also BlackCar Ra model.</p>
