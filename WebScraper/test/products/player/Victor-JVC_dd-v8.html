				<p class="detail">A cassette deck with independent 3-head configuration.<br><br>The head is an independent 3-head system that uses Senalloy for the recording head and MetaPalm for playback.<br>The 3-head system, in which recording, playback, and erasing operations are independently performed, allows the optimum gap width to be set for each head, provides the best adjustment for azimuth, and is extremely advantageous for cross field.<br><br>A pulse servo DD motor is used for the capstan motor.<br>The servo circuit of this motor employs an FG servo that uses a frequency generator to detect rotation. The VICTOR/JVC method employs an all-around integration type of 160 poles and 80 pulses for this part, making detection errors difficult to occur even if positional deviation occurs. To prevent positional deviation, the FG magnet is coaxial with the capstan, and the magnet is magnetized after the center is held.<br>In addition, in order to prevent the rotational accuracy from decreasing due to temperature changes and variations in parts, the multi-pride bridge drive circuit absorbs these effects and improves wow flutter.<br><br>Equipped with auto REC mute.<br>When this function is pressed in the REC mode, a silent space of approximately 4 to 5 seconds is automatically set to the REC standby mode. In addition, Victor&#39;s unique circuit design allows for no recording from the stop mode.<br><br>It is equipped with an index scan and can play the head part of a song for 10 seconds at a time.<br><br>It is equipped with a blank search so that you can look for blank areas on the tape.<br>If there is an unrecorded part for 12 seconds or more in the FF state, it is regarded as a blank, and it automatically returns to the end of the song, sends the blank part for about 4 seconds, and stops.<br><br>Equipped with 2 memory functions of STOP and PLAY, block repeat between 2 points is possible by using both STOP and PLAY memory in addition to the normal STOP memory and PLAY memory.<br><br>Equipped with a 4-digital counter, it can be used as a function of direct reading of remaining time on the tape, 4-digit electronic counter, 20-song skip selection and stopwatch.<br><br>Equipped with a B / E / S tuning system.<br>This circuit not only supports the three fields of normal, chrome, and metal, but also adjusts the bias, equalizer, and sensitivity for each tape within each category to set the recording condition close to the ideal recording condition. The bias setting emphasizes the MOL (maximum output level) balance of the frequency characteristics, not only flattens the frequency characteristics, but also takes as much linearity and dynamic range as possible when recording.<br>For B, E, and S tuning, press the start button to start the bias adjustment operation. The optimum point is selected from 16 steps based on the average value of the left and right sides. The equalizer is divided into 16 steps for the high frequency (12.5 kHz) and 8 steps for the middle frequency (4 kHz). The high frequency is recorded twice and the average value is taken, and the L/R-independent settings are made. Sensitivity is also corrected by taking the average value of the left and right sides. These operations take about 15 seconds. When tuning is complete, the tape is automatically rewound to the start position.<br><br>As a noise reduction system, Dolby C NR is installed, and noise reduction effect and improvement of high frequency linearity are realized.<br>The DD-V8 is equipped with Dolby B NR and MPX filter switches, and uses Dolby standard IC to improve operational stability.<br><br>Equipped with 2-color LED peak meter with peak hold.<br><br>Equipped with timer start mechanism with safety lock.<br><br>Equipped with an auto tape select function.<br><br>Remote control terminal is mounted.</p>
