				<p class="detail">The Quick Reverse Deck was developed with the aim of true digital support by integrating the reverse deck technology of Akai 15 years.<br><br>Twin Field Super GX head is adopted for the head part.<br>The Super GX Head uses ferrite, which has excellent electromagnetic conversion characteristics and moral development in the high-frequency band, as the head material. We have succeeded in making low-noise crystals by using our unique processing technology, realizing high permeability (High μ) and high saturation magnetic flux density (High) of ferrite. This low-noise crystal ferrite is used as the core material, and the whole is hardened with high-hardness glass.<br>The Twin-Field Super GX Head adopts AKAI&#39;s unique twin-field structure in which recording gaps are provided independently in each head housing. Moreover, the recording gap is 4 microns to prevent magnetic saturation even when a deep bias current is applied, and the reproducing gap is 1 micron to ensure frequency characteristics up to ultra-high frequencies. By setting the optimum gap width, the recording / reproducing quality equivalent to that of a 3-head system is achieved.<br>In addition, oxygen-free copper wire with a purity of 99.99% or more is used for the core winding to osae komi the generation of distortion due to capacitive reactances and to protect the purity of the minute current flowing in the head.<br>In addition, it has excellent secondary characteristics such as abrasion resistance and dust adhesion resistance, and maintains high initial performance a long period of time.<br><br>AKAI&#39;s proprietary accurate reverse head system is used for the reverse mechanism.<br>In this mechanism, high-hardness zinc die-cast containing beryllium is adopted as the head housing material, and the head position is maintained with high precision by excellent characteristics such as 2 times the hardness and 8 times the abrasion resistance compared with ordinary zinc die-cast.<br>The rotating part is coated with a smooth solid lubricant to a thickness of several microns to greatly reduce the friction coefficient and achieve smooth rotation.<br>In addition, in order to maintain accurate azimuth system in both directions, stainless steel with high-hardness surface nitriding treatment is used for stopper, and loosening of adjustment screws, which becomes a problem in long-term use, is dealt with by double nut system.<br>As for the rotation of the head, it is a double pinion drive in which the rack with especially low friction coefficient is quickly shifted to right and left by the motor drive, and a simple and complete rotation mechanism is realized.<br><br>The Bi-directional Symmetrical Precision (BSP) mechanism is used for the mechanism part. In this method, the tape transport is almost perfectly symmetrical so that the reciprocating tape running characteristics can be made uniform.<br>In addition, it is equipped with a dual-wide tape guide unique to AKAI. The contact surface with the tape is a wide R surface. The tape guide system that separates the left and right sides of the head increases the line strength of the tape edge. It accurately controls the tape running near the head, and the slight difference in the tape running characteristics between the round and the round is close to 0. In addition, it is able to cope with the variation of the cassette half that cannot be prevented by the normal tape guide that only adheres sheet metal to the side of the head. It also solves problems such as tape curl, track shift, azimuth shift, uneven head touch, and high tape.<br><br>The Dolby B/C and dbx are installed as noise reduction systems.<br><br>A high-tune DC amplifier is used for each of the recording and playback amplifiers. By eliminating the coupling capacitor, which causes sound quality degradation, the dynamic characteristics and resolution are greatly improved.<br>In addition, the newly developed low-noise dual-FET input operational amplifier is used for the reproduction equalizer amplifier. Since this operational amplifier is capable of external phase compensation, it has excellent characteristics such as high slew rate, low distortion rate and low noise comparable to those of a discrete configuration.<br>A differential input high-speed operational amplifier is used for the recording amplifier.<br><br>We carefully select high-grade audio components, including high-resolution FBET (folded-electrode transistor), and use oxygen-free copper wires for wiring.<br><br>The power supply employs a newly designed twin active power supply that is statically and dynamically stable against load fluctuations. Compared with conventional power supplies, this power supply has high-speed and high-equilibrium current control capability, and the dynamic characteristics of the amplifier are greatly improved.<br>In addition, the power supply for the read / write amplifier and the Dolby circuit is separated, and the transformer winding and the rectifier are separated to eliminate interference.<br><br>Equipped with a CRLP (Computer Rec Level Proccesing) system, the computer sets the recording level according to the maximum output level (MOL) of the tape.<br>When the CRLP button is pressed, the bar meter changes to a spectrum display, indicating the peak level of the high / middle / low band of the recording source. At the same time, the reference high / middle / low band MOL corresponding to the tape position is displayed (MOL display function). The volume is automatically adjusted to the optimum level at which the high / middle / low band energy of the recording source does not exceed the respective MoL. Determine the adjustment system The electronic volume is a 65-step type (one step = 1 dB, with memory backup). The recording level is displayed as finely as manual operation, and the value can be read directly by digital display.<br>During recording, the CRLP system also functions as an autoattenuator, reducing the recording level by approximately 1 dB per second so as not to impair the audibility of over-input.<br>You can also set the recording level manually.<br><br>Equipped with a direct lead-in &amp; power eject system.<br>By simply setting the cassette half and pressing the desired operation button, the tape can be loaded automatically. In addition, the ejection is done by motor drive using Akai&#39;s original method.<br><br>Equipped with auto-fader mechanism, fade in and fade out is possible with one touch.<br>You can select 2 speeds, 3 seconds and 6 seconds.<br><br>Equipped with an electronic digital tape counter with real-time display.<br>By adopting a real-time tape counter that displays minutes and seconds, the remaining time of the tape and playing time of the music can be measured.<br><br>The FL display is adopted for the display part, and all information is displayed in a centralized manner.<br>The bar meter is a 2-color 12-segment peak meter. In addition, the GX-R70 can be switched to a spectrum display that allows you to check the peak level of the high band and the middle and low band. At the same time, the MOL display function displays the high band MOL (SOL) and the middle and low band MOL (MML) according to the type of tape used.<br><br>Equipped with IPLS (Automatic Tracking Mechanism), you can track the next song or the song being played.<br><br>Equipped with auto-mute mechanism, you can create a space between songs of about 4 seconds.<br><br>Equipped with an auto tape selector that automatically detects the type of tape.<br><br>Equipped with an MPX filter switch.<br><br>Output volume is mounted.<br><br>Equipped with a timer start mechanism.<br><br>Equipped with a reverse selector to select the tape running mode.<br><br>Gold plated terminals are used for the line input / output terminals.<br><br>The power cable is marked with a white line on one side for easy polarity adjustment.<br><br>There were Wired Remote Control RC-32 and Wireless Remote Control RC-92 as options sold separately.</p>
