				<p class="detail">CD player with new technologies such as dynamic balance servo system.<br><br>The mechanism is equipped with Sansui original SF (solid &amp; flex) mechanism.<br>This mechanism consists of a mechanical chassis and a play chassis. The play chassis uses a floating suspension system that mechanically floats from the mechanical chassis with coil springs and an NR damper to block the effects of internal resonance and external vibration.<br>In addition, the pickup section is fixed to the die-cast base, and the tray is made of BMC material for high rigidity to eliminate unnecessary vibration and resonance.<br><br>A combination of a coil spring and center guide and a magnetic disk clamper are used to prevent disk eccentricity.<br><br>A newly developed dynamic balance servo system is used for the servo circuit. The power transformer is wound separately for the servo system and the analog system, and the servo circuit is separated from the ground to prevent servo noise from entering the music signal.<br><br>The digital filter employs a 4 x over-sampling digital filter that increases the sampling frequency from 44.1 kHz to 176.4 kHz, a 4 x increase, and reduces high-order harmonic noise in the music signal and sampling frequency.<br>This digital filter has excellent phase characteristics, cutoff characteristics, group delay characteristics, and extremely low ripple in the audio band. Therefore, the load on the analog filter is reduced, and sufficient filter effect can be obtained by using a low-order low-pass filter with simple and gentle attenuation characteristics. As a result, phase disturbance and distortion in the music signal band, which were generated by conventional high-order analog low-pass filters, are greatly reduced.<br><br>The D/A converter uses an independent twin D/A converter for both left and right.<br>The D/A converter is equipped with a high-precision ladder -type D/A converter capable of high-speed serial data processing to eliminate glitches (noise) during D/A conversion. By using this high-speed, high-precision D/A converter in a twin configuration with independent left and right channels, phase difference and crosstalk between channels are minimized, and sound quality is improved. In addition, a cross-fine circuit is adopted to suppress 0 cross distortion that occurs in minute signal regions.<br><br>The analog low-pass filter uses a newly developed balanced low-pass filter to balance the output of the D/A converter. As a result, noise outside the audible band does not enter the ground of the analog amplifier, and the ground is clean.<br>The low-pass filter is made of LC-OFC material with excellent frequency characteristics.<br><br>SANSUI&#39;s unique α -X balanced circuit is used for the circuit from the analog low-pass filter to the output. By making the signal system independent from ground, noise and distortion including digital noise are eliminated.<br><br>Equipped with balanced output terminal.<br><br>The power supply section is composed of six independent power sources using a large power transformer. Analog and digital systems, servo systems, display systems, D/A converter systems and muting systems are separated.<br>In addition, a stabilized power supply circuit with excellent response is adopted.<br><br>The master clock system, which operates the digital signal processor, digital filter and D/A converter at the same clock, eliminates harmful beats caused by clock phase shifts and clock frequency differences when using multiple clock oscillators.<br><br>Solid &amp; anti-flux chassis is used for the chassis structure.<br>By installing shields and separators for high rigidity in the servo system, digital section and analog section, unnecessary vibration is eliminated, and interference between each section and external electromagnetic noise is prevented.<br><br>5-point support CF5 insulator with optimum load balance is adopted for the leg part to suppress external vibration.<br><br>Equipped with two digital output terminals that are coaxial with the optical system.<br><br>It is equipped with a large FL display with enhanced visibility.<br><br>It is equipped with functions such as random play, variable music scan and 4-mode repeat.<br><br>Equipped with auto-space function.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
