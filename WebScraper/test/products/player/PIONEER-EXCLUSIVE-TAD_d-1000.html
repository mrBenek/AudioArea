				<p class="detail">Pioneer&#39;s DAT Deck No. 1.<br><br>In order to ensure that the input and output waveforms are identical, an oversampling re-independent double digital filter configuration, which was not used even in professional PCM recorders, is employed.<br>By operating the D/A converter at twice the normal sampling frequency on the playback side, the digital filter reduces the load on the analog low-pass filter in the latter stage and improves the frequency characteristics, distortion factor, and group delay characteristics. In the conventional digital filter, only an analog low-pass filter with steep attenuation characteristics was used for A/D conversion during recording, so the distortion and phase delay of the analog filter caused considerable distortion and distortion in the music signal. The D-1000 is equipped with a digital filter on the recording side to achieve low-distortion sound quality with excellent phase characteristics up to the high frequency range.<br><br>The D/A converter is equipped with an oversampling glitch less D/A converter.<br>In conventional resistive ladder-type D/A converters, it takes time to stabilize the analog output after the digital data is input to the D/A converter due to variations in the response of each switching. As a result, a glitch, a type of noise, occurs in the output.<br>The D-1000 solves this problem by speeding up the operation of the D/A converter and improving the sound quality by realizing a simple signal path that does not go through the digricher by making it glitch less.<br>In addition, the use of independent D/A converters on the left and right sides eliminates the phase difference between the channels.<br><br>The audio circuit board uses twin monoconstruction.<br>In this configuration, the recording / playback and L/R circuits are divided into four sections, and the arrangement of parts and the length of wires are symmetrical to eliminate interference between each block.<br>In addition, noise is greatly reduced by grounding one side of the audio printed circuit board. In addition, bus bars made of 1 mm thick oxygen-free copper plates are used for power supply lines and ground lines on the circuit board to reduce ground impedance and increase the rigidity of the circuit board.<br><br>All condensers and resistors are made of high-quality sound components.<br>Metalized polyester film capacitors with non-inductive OFC lead wires are used as coupling capacitors for analog signal paths, and OFC lead wires and gold-plated brass cap mold carbon film resistors are used as signal resistors.<br>In addition, oxygen-free copper wires are used for signal wiring.<br><br>The slide volume is the same as that used in professional mixing consoles, enabling fine adjustment of recording levels and greatly improving the separation characteristics at high frequencies.<br><br>It is equipped with newly developed cassette スタイビ riser in order to realize stable operation by suppressing vibration of the tape.<br>In the cassette stabilizer, vibration is suppressed by sandwiching the cassette half with special resin material from above and below.<br><br>In order to reduce vibration from the outside, a large solid brass insulator with excellent vibration damping characteristics is adopted.<br>In addition, the insulator is firmly secured to the double chassis with oxygen-free copper washers and copper-screws to eliminate vibration.<br><br>It uses a copper-plated chassis to greatly reduce magnetic distortion, which adversely affects sound quality, and shields the digital circuit to prevent unwanted interference from the digital circuit, creating a clear separation between the digital and analog circuits.<br><br>The power supply is composed of 7 independent 2-transformer power supplies that separate the digital and analog systems, eliminating interference from the digital system to the analog system.<br>The analog transformer has a 2-winding power supply configuration that is strong enough to handle large load fluctuations, and oxygen-free copper wires are used for the windings and lead wires. The digital transformer also has a 5-winding power supply configuration that uses oxygen-free copper wires for stable power supply.<br><br>The circuit board that makes up the entire power supply circuit is made of copper foil with a thickness of 70 μ m, twice as thick as the normal one, to reduce impedance.<br><br>Pioneer&#39;s original linear skating mechanism is adopted for the deck mechanism part, and combined with high rigidity shaft and linear bearing, excellent quietness and reliability are obtained.<br>In the linear skating mechanism, the deck mechanism is incorporated into the cassette and can be operated while monitoring the tape running condition. In addition, operability is improved by the auto lead-in function, which automatically mounts and skates just by inserting the cassette, and the auto lead-out function, which allows the cassette to be ejected with one touch.<br><br>The motor section employs a 4 dd mechanism using two drum motors, capstan motors and reel motors. High reliability is achieved by a high-precision digital servo system and a highly stable tension speed control system.<br><br>Equipped with a peak margin indicator, it is possible to make appropriate adjustments for digital recording that will cause sudden distortion when the level meter exceeds 0 dB (maximum quantization level).<br><br>Equipped with a digital drive peak meter that displays digital signals directly as bars.<br>By directly driving the meter with a digital signal, it enables accurate level monitoring during recording. The meter is Oatley set with a peak held for approximately 3 seconds.<br>Both digital and analog inputs can monitor extremely accurate recording levels, and the maximum digital signal level can be read even when the signal is emphasized, so there are no recording errors.<br><br>It is equipped with the easy operation function using subcode which is unique to DAT deck.<br><br>Equipped with an auto ID recording function, you can automatically record the start ID and program number that indicate the beginning of the track during recording. You can also cancel this function.<br>In addition, the manual ID recording function allows you to set or erase a start ID or skip ID anywhere you want.<br><br>Equipped with a Oatley number function, you can record by adding to a tape that has been recorded up to a certain part, or automatically organize the number of songs after adding or deleting the start ID manually.<br><br>Equipped with a program number setting function, you can freely set the program number at the start of recording.<br><br>It is equipped with one shot direct music selection function, and you can play the desired music just by specifying the program number and pressing play button.<br><br>Equipped with skip playback function, you can skip unnecessary parts and play (with cancel function)<br><br>Equipped with a guiding operation function, the microcomputer detects and displays the ID mode and tape status, and by operating according to the display, the ID can be recorded or erased reliably.<br><br>It is equipped with a blank monitor function so that unrecorded parts can be recognized during playback, fast-forward or rewind.<br><br>Equipped with an emphasis ON/OFF function.<br>Music signals generally have fewer high-frequency components than low-frequency components, so you can improve the dynamic range and S/N ratio in the high-frequency range by pre-emphasizing the high-frequency components during recording and de-emphasizing the high-frequency components during playback.<br>On the D-1000, you can record by turning the emphasis ON/OFF according to your preference, and playback is automatically switched during playback.<br><br>Two types of digital input / output terminals are installed : coaxial and optical.<br>The optical cable terminal can be switched ON/OFF.<br><br>It is equipped with a music search function that enables you to skip songs, introscan that plays the beginning of a song every 10 seconds, Oatley wind, repeat, and a program playback function of up to 50 songs.<br><br>It is equipped with a time calculation function using the 60 decimal system which is convenient for calculating the remaining time of the tape.<br><br>Equipped with timer recording and replay function.<br><br>In the REC/PAUSE and REC states, both analog and digital source monitors are available, so you can use it as an A/D converter or D/A converter. The REC/PAUSE state is released in five minutes, but the music signal is still output.<br><br>If you input the digital output of a CD, you can monitor, but not record.<br><br>You can play back tapes recorded at 32kHz/16bit.<br><br>It comes with a wireless remote control with numeric keys that can perform almost all operations at hand.</p>
