				<p class="detail">Stereo cassette deck with metal tape position &quot;ZX&quot; added to 580.<br><br><br>A 2-head configuration is -head configuration.<br><br>The newly developed RP-9E type recording / reproducing head is used for the recording / reproducing head. Although it is a recording / reproducing head, it is designed so that the core does not become saturated even when a large bias current is applied like metal tape, and a sharp critical zone is generated.<br><br>The erase head is equipped with E-8L which is a double-gap erase head.<br>This head is an improvement on the 1-turn coil direct flux elimination head adopted in 580. We pay attention to the fact that the recorded signal is modulated and the distortion increases when there is an erasure residue in the low-frequency range. We focus on ensuring the erasure rate in the low-frequency range. With an ultra-small special structure and processing technology, the erasure rate at 400 Hz is 80 dB or more even in saturated recording, and it can be sufficiently erased even with metal tape with a large holding force (Hc). There is also almost no temperature rise.<br><br><br>Resonant diffusion type transport is adopted for the mechanism part.<br>In general, the values indicated as wow and flutter are values without flutter components, but we consider that flutter components have a strong influence on audibility. Therefore, we are working to improve mechanical systems with the primary goal of reducing flutter even if it is not included in the specifications.<br>The mechanism uses a frequency-distributed double capstan system. By changing the capstan diameter of the closed-loop double capstan, which holds the tape with two capstan, and by dispersing the frequencies of the wow flutter, the overlap of peaks is further suppressed, sound turbidity due to modulation of the fundamental sound is eliminated, and localization is also stabilized.<br><br>A PLL servo motor is used as the drive motor, and low wow flutter is achieved by phase-locked loop control.<br><br>The mechanism chassis adopts a resonance damping type chassis, and by combining aluminum with resin molded parts, which have large vibration damping characteristics, it absorbs micro vibrations generated from motors and other rotating bodies.<br><br>The flywheels are machined from a round iron bar and have no dynamic or static imbalance, contributing to the improvement of the wow flutter.<br><br><br>A DC recording amplifier is used for the recording amplifier. By eliminating the coupling capacitor connected to the head from the recording amplifier, distortion during recording is improved and phase around low frequency is prevented.<br><br>Double-NF circuits are used for both recording and playback equalizers. negative feedback is applied to the capacitors of the recording and playback equalizers to reduce distortion caused by the capacitors and to improve DC stability.<br><br><br>IC logic control is adopted in the operation part. For all operations such as Play / FF / Lw / Pause / Stop, instructions are entered into the logic circuit by pressing the soft touch button, and the mechanism is operated by the control motor.<br>Unlike the solenoid type, which consumes a large current instantaneously, the current is stable and the tape can be contacted slowly without damaging the tape. In addition, the tape can run stably and quietly.<br><br>It is equipped with an easy queuing function. If you press the Pause / Queue button during FF/REW, the speed of the recorded sound is reduced to about 1/3 of the speed type and the recorded sound is heard. If you continue to press the FF/REW button, the speed of the recorded sound is further reduced to about 1/5 of the original speed. You can easily start a song.<br><br>Equipped with a high-speed auto-shutoff mechanism, it shuts off at a speed of 0.4 seconds to prevent troubles such as tape winding.<br><br>Equipped with timer recording and replay mechanism, and by combining with audio timer, it is possible to play combining with audio timer.<br><br>It has a headphone jack.<br><br>Equipped with a 47 dB full-range peak level meter.<br><br>Equipped with test tone for adjusting the 400 Hz 0 dB level.<br><br>There was a remote control unit as an option sold separately.</p>
