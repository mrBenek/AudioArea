				<p class="detail">This is a twin record re-quick leaver deck with various editing functions to enhance the tape editing ability.<br><br>The Sound Auto-Focus feature automatically sets the recording level using a microcomputer and drive volume that also detects the source signal level, tape type, Dolby NR status and automatically sets the lowest recording level.<br><br>It is equipped with a cassette stabilizer. As soon as the tape is loaded into the mechanical deck, the stabilizer inside the cassette door firmly secures the cassette half and reduces vibration of the tape.<br><br>Based on a laser amorphous head that takes advantage of the characteristics of amorphous magnetic alloys, we have adopted a PC-OCC wound laser amorphous head that uses high-purity oxygen-free copper PC-OCC for the head winding.<br><br>Equipped with Dolby HX Pro, the effective bias amount is controlled to the optimum value in 1/1000 second unit to prevent over-bias and increase linearity in the high frequency range.<br><br>It employs a super-bias, and by greatly shifting up the frequency of the bias signal, the frequency difference with the audio signal is expanded, and generation of beat noise and intermodulation distortion due to mutual interference is suppressed.<br><br>It is equipped with a bias fine tuning function that can fine-tune the optimum bias value that slightly differs depending on the type of tape.<br><br>Equipped with a CD sync recording function, it can be easily recorded from a CD to a deck by combining it with Sony&#39;s remote-controlled CD player.<br><br>It adopts FL linear electronic counter of minute and second display linked with time.<br>Equipped with a subtraction function that makes it easy to understand the remaining time.<br><br>It is equipped with a peak level meter that displays the peak value of the music signal in real time and also has a peak hold function.<br><br>The display can be switched on and off by remote control.<br><br>Equipped with auto-fader function, you can use fade in / fade out freely.<br>In addition, it is also possible to fade in the record in conjunction with the timer.<br><br>It employs a twin recording and re-reverse mechanism with two decks. This allows simultaneous recording of the same source, continuous 180 minute air check with two C-90 tapes, and tape editing / dubbing from A deck to B deck.<br><br>The A deck has a pitch control function.<br>You can fine-tune the tape speed by approximately ± 10% during playback and dubbing (standard speed only).<br><br>It is equipped with a multi-AMS function that can quickly start up to 30 songs before and after.<br><br>When the tape contains an unrecorded portion for more than 10 seconds during playback, it automatically fast-forwards to the next song and starts playback again.<br><br>Equipped with an auto pause function. With this function, when dubbing, Deck A is put into a playback pause state for each song while Deck B waits for a recording pause. This allows synchronized dubbing while selecting a song.<br><br>It is equipped with the Auto Space REC MUTE function. When you press the REC MUTE button during recording or recording pause, it automatically records silence for approximately four seconds, then sends the tape for that amount and stops temporarily.<br><br>Power loading is adopted, and the cassette is automatically loaded into the mechanical deck just by pressing the operation button such as play or fast forward / rewind without closing the cassette door, and it quickly shifts to each operation mode.<br>This series of operations is also performed when the remote control is operated.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
