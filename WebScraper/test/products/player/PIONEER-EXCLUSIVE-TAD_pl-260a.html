				<p class="detail">A full auto player that uses an SH rotor type coreless motor.<br><br>With a full-auto mechanism, you can place a record on a turntable and press the start button to auto-lead-in. In addition, it auto-returns when the record finishes playing, auto-cut and auto-repeat can be performed with one button operation.<br>We also do quick play.<br><br>The control buttons are laid out on the front of the cabinet and can be operated with the dust cover closed.<br><br>An SH rotor type coreless motor is used as the drive motor.<br>In the SH-rotor system, the rotor support point, which used to be located at the bottom of the motor, is moved just below the turntable so that the center of gravity of the turntable almost coincides with the support point. This eliminates from the root the reverse cone motion and the rotational slippage caused by the lubricating oil used between the shaft and the bearing. In addition, the bare nature of the motor before the servo was applied is improved, and the rotation of the turntable is stabilized. In addition, parts such as shafts and bearings are also improved in accuracy of micron order or less by utilizing Pioneer&#39;s precision processing technology, and reliability and durability are improved.<br>The SH rotor type coreless motor realizes smooth rotational torque without cogging by using a coreless structure in which a driving coil is an empty core and a flat coil is used to generate a magnetic field without using a core. In addition, the diameter of the coil for generating the magnetic field is increased, a thin flat coil is used for the coil, and the power efficiency required for torque generation is improved by using Pioneer&#39;s original new IC, and high torque is realized.<br><br>The tone arm uses a static balance S-shaped tone arm.<br>Mass concentration system is adopted for this arm to reduce the moment of inertia which affects the traceability of the tone arm by moving the main weight closer to the fulcrum (arm shaft).<br><br>The cartridge is equipped with a high power MC cartridge that can be used in the MM position.<br>This cartridge uses Pioneer&#39;s independently developed 6-pole 4-magnet configuration for the left and right sides. Samarium-cobalt magnets with high energy product (BHmax) are placed opposite to each other in the same pole. As a result, a high magnetic flux of up to 10,000 Gauss can be obtained, and power is efficiently generated linearly from small amplitude to large amplitude. In addition, as the left and right sides are independently generated, there is essentially no interference between channels, and excellent separation characteristics are obtained.<br>In this MC cartridge, the magnetic circuit and needle are separated and independent, so the needle exchange can be done as easily as MM type.<br><br>The cabinet uses a coaxial suspension.<br>In this system, the motor and tone arm are fixed to a single underboard, and the whole underboard is spring supported, preventing harmful resonance and suppressing howling.<br>In addition, by adopting a thin design of 96 mm, the area that receives sound pressure is reduced and excellent howling resistance is realized.<br><br>Rotational speed can be finely adjusted.</p>
