				<p class="detail">An address loaded cassette deck with an amorphous head and removable wireless remote control.<br><br>An amorphous head is used for the read / write head.<br>Unlike crystalline alloys, amorphous alloys do not have a crystal structure, so they have excellent characteristics that conventional magnetic material heads do not have. In the amorphous head, high-frequency loss is suppressed by making the amorphous alloy multilayer laminate structure, the frequency characteristics of effective permeability is improved, and bias efficiency is also improved.<br>Since this head has twice the hardness of Sendust, it has excellent abrasion resistance. In addition, since there is almost no magnetic strain, sliding noise is extremely small, and frequency characteristics are excellent. This greatly improves the SN ratio in the high range.<br><br>The erase head uses a 2-gap AF (Aurex ferrite) head with high erase efficiency.<br><br>Comes with a removable wireless remote control.<br>This remote control is equipped with a special lens filter to increase the sensitivity. Also, it is equipped with a magnet hold. In addition, it can prevent erroneous operation with the rhythmic operation function to check the operation (can be ON/OFF).<br><br>A 2-motor IC logic new simple mechanism is used for the mechanism part.<br>In this mechanism, the capstan drive and the reel base drive are driven by independent motors to simplify the mechanism. In particular, by using a motor for the reel base with less cocking, torque unevenness is improved.<br>In addition, the automatic reverse take-up mechanism, which changes the take-up direction according to the rotating direction of the motor, uses a swing-head gear drive mechanism instead of the reverse idler method. High-precision gear and a design that does not require friction in the reverse mechanism improve the rotational control capability of the motor for driving the reel table.<br>In addition, the main rotating shaft is laid out on the same chassis to improve the system of the rotating system. In addition, by setting independent back tension for both constant speed and high speed operation, the tape is prevented from sagging and the operation is stabilized, thereby suppressing modulation noise.<br><br>Equipped with MQSS mechanism that can be used for head-tracking.<br>When you want to listen to the next song during playback, this function detects the unrecorded portion before the next song and stops if you fast-forward with it turned ON. It automatically returns to the regenerating condition. When you want to listen to the next song, you repeat it. This function can also be used when rewinding.<br>This switch also turns ON the MPX filter to prevent malfunction during air check.<br><br>As a noise reduction system, it is equipped with an address unique to Orex.<br>As for address, we have achieved high sound quality by greatly reducing hissing, which was a major drawback of cassette, and expanding dynamic range at the same time, and avoiding bleeding noise and distortion.<br>You can also play back address records.<br><br>Dolby NR is also installed as a noise reduction system.<br><br>Equipped with an FL electronic digital counter.<br>This counter consists of a 3-digit digital counter and a 5-time flashing dot that lights up during MQSS operation and disappears during fast forward or rewind.<br><br>Equipped with an FL peak program meter with an attack time of 10 msec.<br><br>Equipped with pause / mute function.<br>In this function, the Rec mute is activated while you press it, and the pause is activated the moment you release it.<br><br>± 2 power supply configuration is adopted.<br><br>Equipped with a one touch recording function, recording is possible with one REC button.<br><br>Equipped with a timer standby mechanism.<br><br>Equipped with an audio output volume.<br><br>It has a headphone port.<br><br>The microphone terminal is mounted on the back.</p>
