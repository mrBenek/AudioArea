				<p class="detail">Quick reverse cassette deck using fine axis quick reverse mechanism.<br><br>The reverse mechanism adopts fine axis and quick reverse mechanism.<br>This mechanism delicately adjusts the rotation center of the head and the track center of the tape, and keeps the relative position (axis = axis) of each accurately. This prevents the fluctuation of the high frequency characteristics due to the fluctuation of the frequency characteristics of the outward and return paths.<br>In addition, the sound quality has been improved by means of a two point holding structure that minimizes head tip vibration and parts accuracy on the order of 10 microns.<br><br>It uses a silent mechanism composed of 2-motor full logic and mechanical drive motor, and the timing of tape reversal is made smooth by high-speed judgment of tape reversal by microcomputer.<br><br>The recording / reproducing head is equipped with SA (Senalloy), and the winding and lead wire of the head are made with LC-OFC (Linear Crystal oxygen-free copper), greatly reducing signal loss.<br><br>In order to eliminate mutual interference between the amplifier section and the control section, a two block layout with separate structure is adopted.<br><br>High-rigidity chassis and large insulator are used to prevent unnecessary vibration.<br><br>In order to input the music source at the shortest distance, it is equipped with a direct input terminal that can be directly connected to a CD player.<br><br>The front panel power switch, input selector and input level volume are designed to be switched just before the rear panel input terminal via the remote bar. Noise is eliminated by shortening the signal path, and the transmission route of each circuit block is designed to be shortest.<br><br>A low-output impedance power supply with ± tracking control using a large transformer is used for the power supply.<br>In this power supply circuit, the stability of the amplifier is improved by operating the positive side and the negative side in cooperation so that the ground potential is always 0. In addition, by setting a constant voltage circuit in which the output impedance is lowered to 1m Ω or less in the audio frequency band, a power supply resistant to changes in the music signal and disturbance noise is realized.<br><br>Equipped with a Dolby B/C NR system as a noise reduction system.<br><br>Equipped with the Dolby HX-PRO, the high-frequency dynamic range is greatly improved by controlling the effective bias to be constant according to the fluctuation of the input signal during recording.<br>Because this circuit operates during recording, it is also effective for playback on decks without the Dolby HX-PRO.<br><br>It is equipped with a music scanning function, and you can start 9 songs before and after the song you are listening now with a remote control.<br>If it is from the TD-R611 main unit, you can start a song.<br><br>Equipped with a digital counter, you can check the remaining time automatically by setting the length of the cassette tape.<br><br>Equipped with a 16-dot peak meter and a digital peak display function that can read peak levels numerically.<br><br>Equipped with a Memory Stop function. This function enables you to stop automatically when you press the memory button to count when you fast-forward or rewind.<br><br>Equipped with a blank skip function, you can fast-forward to the next song if there is an unrecorded part for more than 10 seconds during playback.<br><br>Equipped with auto-repeat function.<br>If you set the counter to 0000 for the starting point you want to listen to and use the memory button to memorize the ending point, you can play repeatedly in between.<br><br>Equipped with a timer start mechanism, you can record your absence or play an alarm by combining with an optional timer.<br><br>Equipped with MPX filter.<br><br>Equipped with a headphone port with volume.<br><br>Equipped with a sync terminal, recording can be performed synchronously with the Victor CD player.<br><br>Wireless remote control with 10 keys is included.<br>With this remote control, you can select one jump music, reset the remaining time and counter, and set the memory position.</p>
