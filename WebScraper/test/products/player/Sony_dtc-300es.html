				<p class="detail">As a new standard model, this DAT deck was developed with particular attention to sound quality.<br><br>The A/D section combines a 2 fs A/D converter and a 2 fs digital filter to reduce the load on the low-pass filter by doubling the sampling frequency. The converter itself uses a newly developed chip with improved acoustic distortion. In addition, the phase is corrected by time axis control.<br>The D/A converter block uses a 16-bit D/A converter equipped with a 4 fs digital filter for independent L/R operation.<br>In addition, the A/D and D/A sections are completely separated on a dedicated circuit board to reduce mutual interference.<br><br>2D. D. + 1 + 1. D. + 1 BSL motor mechanism.<br>DTC-300ES has a mechanism with high reliability and excellent operation feeling by installing 2 motors exclusively for tape loading.<br><br>It is equipped with a subcode function that records absolute time from the tape top, time search using absolute time, recording start ID and end ID in addition to skip ID and start ID, rehearsal function that allows fine adjustment when writing ID, program number function, renumber number from the head of the tape, erase function that individually erases start ID, skip ID and program number, and shift number function that resets all start IDs by 0.3 seconds in advance.<br><br>Two types of input / output terminals, one for each of optical and coaxial digital, are mounted.<br>The optical input uses a servo-type digital signal normalizer circuit that absorbs jitter caused by cables.<br><br>Equipped with a linear counter that can be switched to 4 modes : counter display indicating running time, reproducing display indicating remaining time of the tape, program time indicating elapsed time of the music being played, and absolute time indicating absolute time from the tape top.<br><br>When recording with digital input from a BS tuner or other DAT deck, the FOMA terminal waits for up to 10 minutes in the recording pause even if the signal is interrupted. This allows you to set the recording start time with time, such as when recording with a timer.<br><br>Mechanism, digital, analog and display sections are clearly separated, and internal construction reinforced by sub-chassis is adopted.<br><br>Equipped with wide range digital peak meter of -60dB to 0 dB with each ch24 segment.<br>The data on which the digital peak meter display is based refers to the data of the digital processing circuit.<br><br>It is equipped with a display off function in consideration of minute noise generated by the FL tube.<br>In addition, it is equipped with a dimmer function that can change the display brightness by 6 levels depending on the brightness of the room or preference.<br><br>It is equipped with a cue &amp; review function at two speeds, approximately 2 x speed and approximately 16 x speed.<br><br>Equipped with a blank search function that automatically searches for unrecorded parts that have never been recorded.<br><br>By combining the timer sold separately, it is possible to record your absence and play the alarm clock.<br><br>In addition to most of the operation of the main body, it comes with a wireless remote control which can be operated such as selection of music and pose of Sony&#39;s remote control compatible CD player.<br>In addition, it is possible to perform wireless CD-sync recording in which the recording pause of the main unit is released and the CD performance is started by operating both the main unit and the CD player.</p>
