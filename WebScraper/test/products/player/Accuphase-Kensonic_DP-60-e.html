				<p class="detail">A CD player developed by introducing the technology cultivated in the DP-80L/DC-81L.<br><br>The D/A converter uses a carefully selected IC-type 18-bit D/A converter.<br>Since the bit accuracy of this converter can be adjusted in order to raise the performance to the limit, this advantage is utilized to adjust all products on the production line to achieve the limit performance.<br>We focus on realizing full 18-bit accuracy, and strive to extract marginal performance by thoroughly pursuing stability against environmental changes such as temperature and long-term stability.<br><br>The digital filter uses an 8 x oversampling digital filter to suppress the attenuation between 24.1 and 328.7 kHz to -110dB.<br>In addition, the passband ripple, which causes sound quality degradation, is within ± 0.00005 dB, making the filter of the highest level at that time.<br><br>The audio low-pass filter consists of a discrete GIC third order Butterworth active filter with carefully selected elements, and is designed with an emphasis on sound quality.<br><br>In order to completely separate the digital signal portion and analog circuit in electrostatic and electromagnetic fields, the digital signal portion and analog circuit are electrically separated by an opto-coupler.<br>The opto-coupler is an ultrahigh-speed type with a transmission capacity of 40Mbit/sec. Four opto-couplers are used per channel for complete electrical separation and faithful optical signal transmission.<br>To prevent noise from entering noise from entering through the power supply, the digital and analog power transformers are separated into two transformers. In order to improve audio characteristics, the left and right windings of the analog transformer are separated.<br>In addition, each circuit is completely shielded by a thick metal plate to prevent high-frequency noise components from interfering with static electricity through space and interference as electromagnetism.<br><br>A linear motor mechanism is used to track the laser pickup.<br>It is controlled by a specially developed 8-bit microprocessor, enabling smooth music selection at a speed of approximately one second.<br>The operation of the disk table is controlled by a microprocessor to create a soft feeling.<br><br>The mechanism body is mounted on an aluminum die-cast frame to prevent resonance, and is floated from the chassis to cut off the transmission of vibration.<br>As a result, the disk table is also floating, and vibration to the mechanism body from outside is minimized.<br>In addition, by supporting the mechanism body with a thick metal chassis, it is strengthened against vibration.<br>The overall robust frame structure realizes stable operation with strong resonance and little change in sound quality due to sound pressure from the speaker or location.<br><br>It is equipped with a noise shaper to further reduce quantization noise.<br>The noise shaper reduces noise within the audible band by reducing noise by returning the rounding error generated by the digital filter to the next data. This reduces requantization noise.<br><br>Digital de-emphasis, which changes characteristics according to the state of the digital signal, is adopted in order to support CD with emphasis.<br>As a result, characteristics with deviation of ± 0.001 dB and phase difference of less than 1.5 degrees are realized.<br><br>In the audio stage, the output of the converter is set so that no amplification is necessary, and the amplifier is a DC servo direct connection type with only buffer, so that SN and distortion characteristics are improved.<br><br>Taking advantage of 18-bit, it is equipped with digital volume control.<br>Because of the 2-bit margin, there is little degradation in sound quality even when the volume is reduced, and the level control is ideal.<br>The variable range is 0 ~ -24dB and can be adjusted with a remote commander.<br><br>Two analog RCA phono jacks and one XLR-type balanced output are installed at the output terminal. Especially, the balanced output is in line with the balanced transmission of all amplified systems promoted by AccuPhase.<br>In addition, the digital output was proposed based on the digital audio interface, and it is equipped with an optical fiber and 75-ohm coaxial output specified in the EIAJ standard. The optical transmitter improves pulse width distortion and jitter and enables high-quality transmission.<br><br>It is equipped with a power-on play function that automatically starts playing when the power is turned on in conjunction with a timer.<br><br>Natural Persimmon boards are used on both sides.</p>
