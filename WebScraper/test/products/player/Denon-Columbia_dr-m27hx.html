				<p class="detail">This stereo cassette deck has been designed to further improve sound quality by using an anti-vibration structure.<br><br>The top cover has a double-layered structure with another sheet of steel attached to the inside of the top plate. The bottom plate uses a bi-breath bottom plate composed of three layers of steel plate and plastic film. This plate has an extremely high vibration absorption effect and is also used in Denon CD players.<br>In addition, the capstan motor is mounted on a 1.6 mm thick mechanical base with low repulsion rubber for a floating structure, and a large sintered alloy insulator with excellent vibration absorption effect is used for the leg part.<br><br>The tape travel mechanism employs a closed-loop dual capstan system using Denon&#39;s exclusive drive belt system. This system eliminates disturbance caused by minute vibration of the reel and various factors between the two capstan pairs, greatly reducing modulation noise and ensuring excellent head touch at all times.<br>The capstan motor uses an electronically controlled DC-motor with strong torque and no torque fluctuation, and a flywheel with a large moment of inertia on the take-up side to achieve excellent wow and flutter characteristics.<br><br>A computer-controlled silent mechanism using a highly reliable rotary encoder has been adopted for the running system.<br>This system consists of optical rotation detection, a unique rotor encoder for position detection, and a motor for mechanical control (cam drive). All of these are controlled by a microcomputer, so that tape position detection and drive mode confirmation can be done quickly and accurately.<br>In addition, in order to ensure the total quality of tape travel, a DC motor and a non-slip reel drive mechanism are adopted for the take-up mechanism, making it possible to obtain the optimum tape tension at all times. In addition, since there is no mechanical friction between the half and the take-up reel stand, there is no noise when the tape is taken up, and tape travel is not adversely affected. Moreover, since there is no friction point, the durability of the mechanism is improved.<br><br>Equipped with a mechanism to prevent the cassette tape from loosening.<br><br>An SF combination head is used for the recording / reproducing head.<br>The recording head uses a super-permalloy core with a high saturation flux density to maximize the MOL of the tape and improve abrasion resistance. The reproducing head uses a fine-grained ferrite core with excellent high-frequency characteristics and abrasion resistance to reduce fluctuations in magnetic characteristics due to sliding noise and temperature changes. The coil uses an oxygen-free copper wire (OFC) to reduce distortion.<br>By combining these heads with high precision, we have greatly improved the misalignment of the azimuth between the recording and reproducing heads and the head mount adjustment.<br><br>The erasing head uses a double-gap ferrite head with a high erasing effect.<br><br>The power transformer is located as far away from the head as possible to prevent the influence of noise and is mounted on the chassis via a plate to eliminate the influence of vibration. The secondary side of the transformer completely separates the amplifier circuit and logic / mechanical circuit to eliminate the influence of noise.<br><br>The recording amplifier uses a single-chip LSI developed specifically for the deck to ensure the same characteristics for the left and right channels and high stability. In addition, the recording amplifier uses a C. C. D. C. (Constant Current Drive Circuit) to eliminate the change in the head current due to the change in recording frequency by eliminating the output resistance, thereby increasing the dynamic range and realizing a low distortion factor.<br>A low-noise IC is used for the playback amplifier to improve the S/N ratio.<br>Each of the recording and playback amplifiers is directly connected to the head, eliminating the coupling capacitor that can degrade sound quality.<br><br>Equipped with Dolby HX Pro.<br>The Dolby HX Pro eliminates over-bias, which has been a problem with the conventional fixed bias method. When the input signal contains many high-frequency components during recording, the bias amount from the oscillator is automatically reduced. This greatly improves high-frequency characteristics and reduces distortion over the entire band. In addition, since the effective bias value is always constant even when the impedance of the head changes due to temperature changes or other factors, there is no degradation in high-frequency characteristics even during long-term recording.<br><br>Equipped with Dolby B Type and Dolby C Type as noise reduction system.<br>The Dolby circuit uses a newly developed symmetrical one chip LSI for the left and right channels. In addition, the DR-M27HX has a double Dolby configuration in which the Dolby IC is separated into a recording circuit and a reproducing circuit, so that the Dolby effect can be confirmed even during after-monitoring (simultaneous playback).<br><br>Equipped with a REC calibration control function, the recording sensitivity of various types of tapes can be adjusted by adjusting the tape and source levels using the recording calibration signal of the FM tuner or the single-tone signal of the test record.<br>Bias Fine also allows you to fine-tune the amount of recording bias.<br><br>The display is equipped with a 4-digit digital counter with a memory stop function, a bar graph peak meter of + 8 dB to -20dB, and various indicators such as operation status, tape position and memory stop.<br><br>Equipped with a memory stop function.<br><br>Equipped with an auto tape selector, it automatically identifies each tape when it is set and automatically sets the bias / equalizer.<br><br>Equipped with an MPX filter switch, it can prevent Dolby NR malfunction by cutting the 19 kHz pilot signal included in FM radio waves.<br><br>It uses a Pause/Mute mechanism to combine the pause and mute functions.<br>In recording mode, press the Pause/Mute button (within 0.5 seconds) to create a recording pause. Press and hold the button for 1 second or longer to create a 5-second unrecorded portion and make a recording pause.<br><br>A one touch rec-pause mechanism is adopted, and recording standby can be performed only by pressing the Rec button.<br><br>Equipped with a follow-up recording function, you can move from the running state of the tape during playback to the recording state as it is.<br><br>Equipped with a balanced volume.<br><br>Equipped with a Timer Play-Rec mechanism. By connecting a timer sold separately, it is possible to record your absence or play an alarm.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
