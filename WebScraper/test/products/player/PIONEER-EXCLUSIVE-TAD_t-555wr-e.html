				<p class="detail">FLAT SYSTEM, Dolby B / C NR, Dolby HX PRO, control system &amp; counter, and recording / re-quick reverse are independently installed on Deck I and Deck II on the twin recording / re-reverse deck.<br><br>It is equipped with double FLAT SYSTEM (Frequency-response and Level Auto Tuning System) which brings out the maximum performance of the tape by keeping the recording and re-frequency characteristics of the tape flat. It automatically tunes in the order of bias → level → equalizer with 2 points of low frequency (400 Hz) and high frequency (10 kHz) in the order of bias → level → equalizer. During adjustment, the FL display also shows the condition.<br>It is also equipped with a relay FLAT function that automatically adjusts the deck II when the adjustment of the deck I is completed during parallel recording and relay recording.<br><br>Two decks are equipped with Dolby B and CNR respectively.<br>In addition, the Dolby HX PRO is installed on both decks to prevent over-bias that occurs when recording a sound with many high-frequency sections, and to improve the degradation of high-frequency characteristics.<br><br>Operation systems such as knobs and switches are arranged as twin rooms on the left and right as much as possible, and two mode counters independent of Deck I and II are installed.<br>The display is equipped with 3 colors of FL, so you can enjoy it visually.<br><br>Quick reverse recording and rerecording is adopted for both decks.<br><br>It is equipped with a cassette stabilizer to suppress vibration of the cassette half due to rotational vibration of the motor and sound pressure of the speakers. A special rubber stabilizer is provided on the main body side of the deck, and a special resin half pressure is provided on the cassette holder. Both sides of the cassette half are firmly fixed with stabilizers.<br>In addition, it uses a double-lock mechanism that holds the entire cassette holder from both sides. By improving vibration absorption thoroughly, the tape runs stably.<br><br>Honeycomb chassis and large insulators are used to eliminate vibration and resonance in the deck body.<br><br>A laser amorphous head with LC-OFC (linear crystalline oxygen-free copper) winding is used for the read / write head.<br>In addition, we have adopted a oxygen-free copper power cord with polarity display and an electrolytic capacitor for audio equipment to improve conductivity and reduce nonlinear distortion.<br><br>It is equipped with copy level adjustment function (only at constant speed). When editing and copying from tapes with various recording levels, you can use the copy level adjustment function to copy to a fixed level.<br><br>Equipped with CD-DECK synchro compatible function.<br><br>It is equipped with a parallel recording function that can record two sources simultaneously, a relay recording that can record three hours continuously, a blank skip function that detects a silent recording part and automatically fast-forwards it, an auto-space REC mute function that creates a silent part for four seconds and automatically enters a recording pause state, a double-speed copy function that can quickly and easily dub a tape, a sync start and sync stop function, and a jump selection function of 15 songs in front and back.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
