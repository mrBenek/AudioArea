				<p class="detail">This is an ESJ series cassette deck with Dolby S as a noise reduction system as well as inheriting the design philosophy of the high-grade machine.<br><br>It is equipped with Dolby S NR as a noise reduction system. The Dolby S NR is a noise reduction system newly developed for consumer use based on the Dolby SR used in professional equipment. It realizes noise reduction effects of 24 dB in high frequency and 10 dB in low frequency.<br>The ESJ Series is based on the Dolby S IC, which was developed by Dolby R &amp; D Laboratories and made into a chip by Sony. In addition, the ESJ Series uses high-density packaging technology to make it into a single module with peripheral components, thereby realizing both high sound quality and low cost.<br><br>The mechanism uses Lapis (sapphire capstan base system) to further improve the accuracy of the silent and quick action mechanism deck. Quick action mechanism deck. In this mechanism, by using sapphire with high hardness and low friction coefficient for the bearing, rigidity and durability are increased.<br>Combined with the adoption of a 3-phase linear torque BSL motor with less rotational unevenness, the tape running performance is stable.<br><br>By using highly rigid zinc die-cast (Bellick) for the head base material, which is the base of the head, unnecessary vibration is eliminated, and by maintaining accurate azimuth accuracy, good phase characteristics between channels are achieved.<br><br>A monocoque zinc die-cast (Bellick) base is used for the base of the motor to reduce modulation noise generated by external vibration such as sound pressure. In addition, high precision and stable rotational performance is obtained by the integrated structure of motor and base.<br><br>A closed-loop dual capstan system has been adopted in which capstan and pinch stan and pinch rollers on both the take-up side and the supply side centering on the tape head. This improves wow and flutter characteristics and reduces modulation noise caused by tape vibration.<br>In addition, the capstan drive adopts a direct drive system with a 3-phase linear torque BSL motor with less rotational unevenness, and the introduction of a quartz lock servo realizes excellent characteristics.<br><br>High-quality signal transmission has been achieved by using single-crystalline ESC-OCC wire, which is a oxygen-free copper with a purity of 99.997% or more and has almost no grain boundaries, at important points.<br><br>Uses a midship mechanical system with the mechanical deck located in the center of the front panel.<br><br>The chassis structure adopts the NEW rigid beam chassis. The rigidity of the conventional rigid beam chassis was increased by joining the front and rear front and rear with three beams. On the other hand, the rigidity of the NEW rigid beam chassis is further increased by reinforcing the bottom plate with three beams at the front and rear front and rear.<br>In addition, the top plate is fixed with 6-point screws and the chassis material is made of metal material with sufficient thickness to obtain high strength including the cabinet.<br><br>The cassette holder is made of fine ceramic composite material with high rigidity and high specific gravity to reduce unnecessary vibration due to high rigidity. In addition, the cassette lid is made of extruded aluminum material to further improve accuracy.<br><br>The tape is loaded into the mechanical deck, and at the same time, the stabilizing device installed inside the cassette door firmly fixes the cassette half and osae komi the vibration of the tape.<br>In particular, the ES Series uses a new material, sorbacein, for the free-action holding arm and stabilizer to prevent the generation of modulation noise by absorbing harmful vibrations.<br><br>The head employs a PC-OCC wound laser amorphous head that uses amorphous alloys for the core and high-purity oxygen-free copper PC-OCC for the head winding.<br><br>It employs a pad pressure reduction system, and by providing a convex protruding part on the surface of the head so that it touches both ends of the pad on the left and right sides in the tape running direction, extra pad pressure is not applied.<br>This method works especially effectively on the mechanical deck of the closed-loop dual capstan, and reduces modulation noise by realizing an ideal tape contact mainly with tension control in the loop.<br><br>Equipped with Dolby HX Pro, the effective bias amount is controlled to the optimum value in 1/1000 second unit to prevent over-bias and improve linearity in the high frequency range.<br>Also, Dolby HX Pro works only when recording, so recorded tapes are effective when played on any deck.<br><br>Super bias is adopted, and by greatly shifting up the frequency of bias signal, the frequency difference with audio signal is expanded, and beat noise and intermodulation distortion due to mutual interference are suppressed.<br><br>The built-in oscillator provides a bias calibration function that allows you to fine-tune the bias value within a range of ± 20% according to the tape to be used.<br>It is also equipped with a recording calibration function that eliminates the level difference between recording and playback due to tape sensitivity.<br><br>The power cable uses a cabtire cable with excellent durability.<br>This cable has a polarity indicator so that you can match the polarity with other devices.<br><br>CD synchronized recording is possible by combining with Sony remote control compatible CD player.<br><br>It is equipped with an electronic counter that adopts FL tube. It is a linear type that displays minutes and seconds with a subtraction function that makes it easy to understand the remaining time.<br><br>It is equipped with an auto-monitor function that simplifies the operation playback. When you press the play button, it automatically switches from the Source position to the Tape position.<br><br>It is equipped with a peak level meter with peak display and peak hold function of music signal.<br><br>Equipped with a display mode switch, it can be switched from the remote control to 3 modes : all lighting / counter only partial lighting / off.<br><br>Equipped with AMS (automatic music sensor), you can easily find the beginning of the previous or next song.<br>In addition, the ES series has improved usability by making it a one touch operation type.<br><br>It is equipped with the Auto Space REC MUTE function. When you press the REC MUTE button during recording or recording pause, it automatically records silence for approximately four seconds, sends the tape for that amount, and pauses.<br><br>It uses a power loading mechanism. If you press the play / fast-forward / rewind operation button without closing the cassette door, the cassette is automatically loaded into the mechanical deck and the operation mode shifts to each operation mode.<br>This series of operations can also be performed when the remote control is operated.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
