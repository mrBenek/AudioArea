				<p class="detail">A CD player with the technology used in the ES series.<br><br>Digital sync ICs are used to reduce jitter that occurs when digital signals are transmitted.<br>The pit information read from the disk is converted into a digital signal by a signal processing LSI and sent to a digital filter and a D/A converter. During this time period, jitter occurs in the digital signal. The original information of a digital signal is a sequence of encoded numerical values that is not affected by the transmission system, but when it is transmitted as an electrical signal, it is a sequence of pulse signals. For this reason, digital signals that have passed through many circuits fluctuate irregularly, with the pulse width being longer or shorter than it should be. As a result, the clock has jitter, and the time-axis accuracy of the signal deteriorates during D/A conversion.<br>In the digital sync IC, the timing of the digital signal generated by the signal processing LSI is adjusted to the accuracy of the master clock immediately before the D/A converter. The master clock that determines the time axis accuracy of the signal is directly connected to the D/A converter. By adjusting the timing to the accuracy of the clean master clock that does not include jitter, the digital signal is adjusted again and output to the D/A converter. Since the effect of jitter does not affect the D/A converter and beyond, D/A conversion with accurate phase and faithful D/A conversion is possible.<br><br>The digital filter is equipped with CXD 1244 which is an 8 fs 45-bit noise shaping digital filter.<br>This digital filter performs 8 times oversampling and resamples the signal from 44.1 kHz to 352.8 kHz (8 times the sampling frequency) to increase the distance between the audio signal and the unwanted high-frequency components. This enables the use of a low-order low-pass filter with gentle cut-off characteristics in the analog portion after D/A conversion, greatly improving the group delay characteristics.<br>The CXD 1244 achieves the in-band ripple characteristics of ± 0.00001 dB and the echo level of -124dB or less due to its 45-bit high-order computing capability.<br><br>The CXD 1244 is capable of performing extremely high-precision operations with a 45-bit operation bit length. However, since the D/A converter can have only a limited number of bits, round-off errors occur and remain as quantization noise. To solve this problem, we have adopted a high-resolution D/A converter with excellent characteristics and introduced a noise-shaping method, which is incorporated into the CXD 1244.<br>Noise shaping takes advantage of an over-sampling time interval to incorporate low-order bit information that is normally lost by round-off errors into high-order data.<br><br>Equipped with digital de-emphasis function.<br>In digital de-emphasis, the de-emphasis process conventionally composed of analog circuits is digitally processed inside the digital filter, eliminating sound quality degradation caused by parts and circuits, and achieving ideal gain and phase characteristics.<br><br>The D/A converter IC is equipped with a high-precision linear D/A converter.<br>This is a high-speed operation type that corresponds to the data output speed of the 8 fs digital filter and enables more advanced D/A conversion, which improves linearity for small level signals.<br>In addition, this D/A converter is a single-chip IC with high stability of conversion operation and realizes linear operation from the most significant bit to the least significant bit. Therefore, in principle, there is no nonlinear element in input / output characteristics. Therefore, additional circuits such as gain switching are unnecessary, and the analog circuit section is simplified.<br>In addition, by making the left and right channels independent of each other, the phase shift between the channels is eliminated.<br><br>The servo circuit is equipped with S Servo III.<br>The SS Servo III, noise components that cause adverse effects are removed through a low-pass filter, and the influence on the audio circuit is reduced by sending a smooth servo current to the servo circuit. Moreover, unnecessary vibration of the optical system mechanism is also suppressed.<br><br>It is equipped with a custom edit function that combines three functions : time edit, program edit, and time fade.<br>With Time Edit, you enter the time for one side of the tape and press the Edit button to program the music to be played in order from the first song. When you encounter a time-over song, the program automatically selects the longest song within the time range. Press the Edit button once to continue the program for the A side, and press the Edit button again to continue the program for the B side. The pause is automatically inserted between the A side and the B side.<br>In program edit, you program the songs you want to put on the A side of the tape in the order you like, then press the pause button and continue to program the B side.<br>With the Time Fade function, if you set the time beforehand, the FOMA terminal automatically fades out approximately five seconds before the time and enters a pause state.<br><br>The manual fader function allows manual operation to fade in / out.<br>With this function, the fade operation takes approximately 5 seconds from where the button is pressed.<br><br>It includes custom file functionality with three functions : disk memory, custom index, and program bank.<br>With Disk Memo, when you insert a disc, a message you enter appears on the display, followed by the number of songs and the total duration of performance. You can make a note of up to 10 characters per disc. You can use 46 letters, numbers, and special symbols.<br>The custom index allows you to set an index of up to 10 points at any location on a single disk, even if no index information is recorded on the disk itself. The index set includes a rehearsal function that allows fine tuning in steps of approximately ± 0.15 seconds.<br>In the Program Bank, you can directly record a program set with the Program Performance function that can play up to 20 songs continuously. You can call up the program with the File Recall button, or you can directly bank the contents of a program set with Custom Edit.<br><br>It is equipped with a file recall function that allows you to check what files have been stored so far without having to insert a disk.<br>This allows you to check without having to insert a disk, and also to erase the file contents on the spot.<br><br>It is equipped with delete shuffle function for 99 songs.<br><br>Equipped with a multi-mode timer function, you can start from your favorite music, shuffle play and repeat.<br>By combining the custom index function, it is also possible to play the alarm clock with any phrase.<br><br>Two types of analog output terminal are mounted : fixed and variable.<br><br>The headphone port is equipped with a headphone port with a lineout linked volume that flashes when the remote control is operated.<br><br>Equipped with an optical digital output.<br><br>It is equipped with a program performance function of up to 20 songs, 6-mode repeat function of 1 song / whole song / part (remote control only) / program / shuffle / custom index, and auto space function.<br><br>Equipped with 2-speed Music Search that enables fast forward / fast backward while listening to music.<br>Slow mode can only be operated from the remote control.<br><br>Comes with a 20-key wireless remote control with volume control.</p>
