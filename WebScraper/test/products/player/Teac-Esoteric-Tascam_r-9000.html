				<p class="detail">This auto-reverse deck was developed with the aim of being top-class in both sound and function.<br><br>The A. R. H. S3 head mechanism, which is a rotary head type, is adopted as the reverse mechanism by brush-up.<br>Since the rotary reverse mechanism uses the same head in both directions, it is extremely advantageous in terms of electrical characteristics. The best position can be set regardless of the direction of the head azimuth. However, in order to achieve this, the rotating head must always be precisely in a fixed position. In this mechanism, precision die casting of micron order is adopted for the bearing part of the rotating head holder, and high durability and high precision alumina ceramic are used for the positioning. Thus, accurate head azimuth and head position accuracy in both directions are obtained. In addition, precision and smooth operation is achieved by carefully selected ultra-precision miniature bearings for the bearing part.<br>In the reverse operation, the end of the tape is detected by the reflection type IR sensor, and quick reverse operation with almost no sound interruption is realized.<br><br>The head uses PGCC winding high-hardness permalloy combination 3 heads, ensuring high performance in both recording and playback.<br>Double-gap Sendust guard is used for the erasing head.<br><br>The mechanism is equipped with E. M hysteresis and tension servo with improved running performance.<br>In this system, the reel rotation speed is detected by an IR photo-reflector, and torque control is carried out electrically in a non-contact manner. Therefore, the optimum back tension is always maintained regardless of the direction of travel or the amount of tape winding. This E. M hysteresis servo, A. R. H. S mechanism, and three recording / playback heads enable uniform characteristics and sound quality in both directions.<br>The capstan has a high-precision large flywheel (inertial mass 1100g/cm).<sup>3</sup>Thus, stable driving characteristics are obtained.<br><br>All reproduction amplifiers such as the equalizer amplifier are equipped with an all-DC configuration amplifier with ± 2 power supply configuration and direct coupling. By eliminating the capacitor from the signal system, characteristics in all bands including the low band are improved.<br>In addition, the power supply unit has been enhanced by increasing the power supply capacity, and the Dolby circuit has a large margin to support digital sources and other sources with a wide dynamic range.<br><br>An anti-static cassette stabilizer is installed to eliminate the influence of modulation noise caused by the micro vibration of the cassette half.<br>The arm part of this stabilizer has a 3-layer structure of 3 mm thick aluminum to prevent resonance. In addition, this system is equipped with a highly conductive special pad with half anti-static effect. The pad always contacts the half to prevent half electrification, greatly reducing troubles such as drop-out caused by dust attracted by static electricity. The special pad also has impact absorption effect.<br><br>The internal structure is a fully shielded independent structure.<br>The circuit section is housed in an aluminum die-cast airtight case, and the recording volume, amplifier section, power supply, and display are separated by the inner chassis, so that noise caused by internal interference is completely suppressed.<br>In addition, the use of wire materials is also reduced by a straight circuit design in which each circuit is connected at the shortest distance along the signal path.<br><br>The special chassis and bottom chassis of the running mechanism are integrated for high rigidity and vibration control. The special inner chassis of each part increases the overall rigidity. In addition, it is integrated with the inverted U-shaped bonnet to eliminate the influence of external vibration.<br>In addition, a vibration control sheet is attached to the bone top of the net panel, and a side wood is provided to further improve the vibration control effect to cope with any vibration.<br><br>The legs are equipped with insulators made of high-density special alloy with high internal loss and high sound speed.<br>Equipped with Dolby HX Pro.<br>The Dolby HX Pro always provides an optimum bias according to the input signal to prevent degradation of the high-frequency characteristics during recording.<br><br>By mounting a high-rigidity double-lock cassette holder, the generation of resonance of the holder part is suppressed, and the cassette is surely locked to prevent rattling and vibration caused by floating.<br>In this system, a 1.6 mm thick steel plate is used for the holder section to increase the rigidity and eliminate the Kyoshin. In addition, a triangular cassette support system with three point support is adopted to eliminate the floating and rattling caused by the warpage of the half, which was unavoidable with four point support.<br><br>We have adopted a reel stand with built-in dynamic torque damper that absorbs torque fluctuations caused by the reel motor at the bearing part of the reel.<br><br>An audio condenser manufactured by Ernst Radar Stein Co., Ltd. is used in the power supply section to ensure sound quality.<br><br>Large-capacity type (12A) power cord made of OFC material with polarity indication is used for the power cable.<br><br>Equipped with Dolby B/C NR as a noise reduction system.<br><br>It is equipped with a blank scan so that you can fast-forward the unrecorded part and start playback from the next song.<br><br>Equipped with CD direct input.<br><br>It is equipped with CPS that allows you to skip over 15 songs and select them.<br><br>It is equipped with functions such as auto monitor, auto tape selector and auto rec mute.<br><br>Display can be turned ON/OFF.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
