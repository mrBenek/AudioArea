				<p class="detail">CD player with VRDS mechanism.<br><br>In the VRDS mechanism, a clamper disk is attached to a turntable with the same diameter as the disk and a slight taper angle. This mechanism corrects the warpage and distortion of the disk and completely eliminates vibration and resonance when the disk is rotating.<br>In addition, the pickup, which is finely adjusted to the same angle as the taper angle of the turntable, realizes pit reading at the center of the pickup optical axis at all times, and the turntable is directly driven by a high-precision spindle motor.<br>The VDDS-7 uses modified polyphenylene oxide for its turntable, which has excellent dynamic balance and dimensional accuracy. The bridge that rigidly supports the turntable has a composite structure in which the bridge base is covered with high-performance thermoplastic elastomer with a newly designed thick reinforced rib structure with excellent earthquake resistance.<br>The entire turntable system is floating on a dedicated sub-chassis, minimizing vibration modes and establishing excellent musical performance and resolution.<br><br>The VRDS mechanism and power transformer are mounted at the center of the housing, which matches the center of gravity of the body. By lowering the center of gravity and promoting optimum weight balance, we are committed to earthquake-resistant design.<br>The body has a double-top panel structure with a top panel in the lower layer of the bonnet. Cushioning material is arranged between the top panels, and this is firmly fixed to the chassis by 6-point fastening.<br>The chassis body uses separate block construction divided into 8 parts. In addition to the independent front and rear chassis, a center chassis exclusively for the mechanism is installed. It is assembled into a heavyweight bottom chassis connected to the side panel through two sub-chassis for mechanical floating in the front and rear.<br>In particular, the center chassis, which is directly connected to the front and rear panels, forms a beam structure, greatly strengthens the total body, and realizes high rigidity to prevent even a slight influence of vibration and resonance from all directions of the front, back, left and right.<br><br>The front panel uses 5 mm thick heavy solid aluminum material that has undergone rough scratch treatment.<br>The panel opening area is limited by the minimum necessary switches to prevent the effects of vibration and resonance.<br><br>The DAC is equipped with the Philips D/A converter &quot;SAA7350&quot;, a bit stream type D/A converter, which is in differential mode with two left and right channels to improve sound purity and transparency.<br>In addition, this differential circuit improves channel separation, cancels even harmonics thoroughly, reduces distortion and noise, and combines with a 20bit8 x oversampling digital filter to complete an excellent D/A conversion process cell.<br><br>In addition to the main devices, carefully selected audio-only capacitors are used in digital and analog circuits, and precision metal-coated resistors used in precision measuring devices are used in the entire audio section. The temperature characteristics are within 50 ppm / ℃ with a tolerance of less than ± 1%, ensuring stable operation.<br><br>In the servomechanism that controls the delicate operation of the pickup, if the servo current becomes excessive, the disturbance of the current becomes a noise component, which adversely affects the analog system.<br>For this reason, the driving voltage to the actuator is reduced by a high-quality low-pal filter to minimize unnecessary noise components other than servo current.<br><br>It is equipped with functions such as random memory program, delete program, music skip, 4-mode repeat, auto fader, 3-mode time counter, auto space, index search, music search, display ON/OFF, timer play, etc.</p>
