				<p class="detail">A top-loading CD player.<br><br>In order to eliminate the adverse effects of external sound pressure and vibration on CD disks and pickups, we have eliminated the front loading tray, which is the source of such noise, and adopted a top-loading air tie and structure.<br>This improves the confidentiality of the CD turntable and pickup section and prevents sound pressure from entering the chassis.<br>The glass top is made of 8 mm thick soda-lime glass to reduce external vibration and unwanted resonance.<br><br>By adopting a simple manual loading system, the disk clamper has been made into a large stabilizer by cutting out aluminum.<br>A magnet is incorporated inside the disk and the disk is pressed to prevent vibration of the disk effectively.<br><br>A 6 φ spindle equivalent to the XL-Z1000 is used to prevent twisting of the motor shaft if the motor torque is increased to obtain stable rotation.<br>Twenty seven times the torsional strength of conventional products, eliminating the lag of the spindle against the rotation of the motor.<br>We have also adopted highly reliable motors produced in-house to achieve high precision.<br><br>In order to pursue structural freedom from vibration and resonance, we have adopted a center of gravity holding mechanism.<br>The lens position is located on the center of gravity of the mechanical base when the pickup is on the inner side of the disk, and when it is on the outer side of the disk, it is designed to coincide with the center of gravity of the insulator that supports the chassis housing.<br>As a result, the pickup is structurally traced in a line shape that is least affected by vibration, and adverse effects of vibration are prevented as much as possible.<br><br>A double plate with copper-plated steel plates is used for the mechanical base of the pickup system.<br>In pursuit of a mass that lowers the resonance frequency to the servo band, internal vibration is reduced and external vibration is cut off.<br>In addition, we have adopted a structure in which the mechanical base is supported more firmly than the lower chassis by an insulator with increased damping effect by silicon oil and spring, and a structure in which the mechanical base is supported more firmly than the lower chassis by an acoustic cast iron block.<br>In addition, a pure copper foot is used for the ground plane, and a thorough vibration-proof design is applied to reduce the effect of sound pressure.<br><br>New DD converter is adopted.<br>The D/A conversion method employs a 1-bit DAC method, which in principle does not cause unconformity distortion and distortion that are harmful to sound quality. In addition, the D/A conversion method realizes superior characteristics by improving the defect of the 1-bit DAC, which lacks resolution, with a fourth order noise shaper and a PEM circuit.<br>In order to obtain more ideal conversion characteristics, the operation rate has been increased from 32 times over sampling to 64 times over sampling.<br>As a result, the requantization noise in the entire band is reduced by approximately 10 dB, and noise is suppressed to twice the frequency band of the audio band without relying on a low-pass filter.<br>In addition, by increasing the operation rate, the third harmonic which always occurs in 1-bit DAC has been reduced to 1/4.<br><br>In addition to the D/A separation design that separates the digital circuit board, the digital and analog signal processing sections of the K2 interface, and the audio circuit board, not only separate the digital power supply and audio power supply, but also employ a thorough separation structure in which two transformers are placed independently of the power supply.<br>In addition, we have reduced the size of the digital chip substrate and eliminated the influence of noise by minimizing the signal path. In addition, optical cables are used to transmit signals from the digital transmitter to the receiver, preventing noise from entering the digital transmission path and eliminating leakage of digital noise and power supply leakage.<br><br>It is equipped with a K2 interface that removes digital distortion such as jitter and ripple from transmitted digital signals by a technique called code refinement.<br>Furthermore, by entrusting the accuracy of code generation to the crystal oscillator, more ideal K2 interface operation is realized.<br><br>The clock oscillator circuit is packaged in one chip to improve the accuracy and stability of the crystal oscillator used for timing control of picking up digital codes from CD disks, reference signal for analog conversion of DD converter, and code generation of K2 interface.<br>In addition, the X-tal holding structure, which lowers the center of gravity by laying the oscillator horizontally instead of vertically, eliminates the vibration moment.<br>In addition, the mass of the vibration itself is reduced to 1/2, and it is packaged with a ceramic base with high vibration resistance and a metal Kovar cover with high internal loss to reduce oscillation frequency fluctuations caused by external vibration and sound pressure.<br><br>Synchronous input terminal is provided so that the drive unit can be connected to the external DAC unit at high level.<br>For analog output, a balanced output terminal is also provided.<br><br>It comes with a remote control equipped with a time search function that can call up the part you want to listen to in seconds, dimmer and display OFF switch.</p>
