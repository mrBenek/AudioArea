				<p class="detail">This is a reference W cassette deck with a strengthened power supply and complete vibration-free and resonance-free design in order to respond to the sound quality of digital sources.<br><br>Unlike noise reduction systems such as Dolby B and C, both decks are equipped with Dolby HX PRO, which expands the high-frequency range.<br>Dolby HX PRO is a system that prevents the self-bias phenomenon, in which the high-frequency signal itself functions as a bias when recording a source with many high-frequency components such as digital sources, and improves the high-frequency characteristics by always recording with an appropriate bias. It detects the high-frequency signal flowing in the recording head, controls the bias current according to the increase or decrease of the signal, and greatly improves the high-frequency characteristics.<br>In addition, it is equipped with Dolby B and C, and can be used in combination with Dolby HX PRO to further improve sound quality.<br><br>It is equipped with a cassette stabilizer to suppress vibration of the cassette half caused by motor rotation vibration or external vibration / sound pressure, to realize stable driving, and to realize clear sound with less modulation noise.<br>A special rubber stabilizer is set on the receiving side of the main body, and a special resin half pressure is set on the cassette holder. When the cassette holder is closed, this stabilizer firmly holds the cassette half from both sides.<br>In addition, by adopting a double-lock mechanism that locks the entire cassette holder from both sides, and thorough vibration absorption, vibration characteristics with less peaks are achieved.<br><br>In order to suppress the vibration of the deck body, we focused on the power transformer, which is one of the vibration generating sources. We installed a casted power transformer that uses a cast iron transformer case with high rigidity, high internal loss, excellent vibration damping characteristics, and almost no resonance frequency. This eliminates the noise characteristic of transformers.<br>In addition, we have adopted a honeycomb chassis with high rigidity that greatly reduces resonance and a large honeycomb structure insulator that cuts vibration from the outside. Through these measures, we have taken thorough anti-vibration measures to eliminate adverse effects on sound quality.<br><br>In order to realize a power supply unit that can quickly follow sudden fluctuations in music signals, a high-speed active servo regulator is mounted that instantaneously stabilizes power supply voltage fluctuations due to load fluctuations by high-speed servo.<br>As a result, the frequency analysis of power supply voltage fluctuation is improved by approximately 50 dB at the basic frequency of 1 kHz, and performance is improved by 320 times. In addition, high-frequency characteristics are also greatly improved.<br>In addition, oxygen-free copper (OFC) is used for the power transformer winding and power cord to control polarity, and copper plate is used for heat radiation plate to improve sound quality.<br><br>The recording / reproducing head uses a low-impedance high-performance head that uses oxygen-free copper wire for the winding.<br><br>Each part is carefully examined through a thorough trial listening, and only are useful for improving sound quality are carefully selected and used.<br>We use oxygen-free copper wire cords with polarity indication to improve conductivity and reduce non-linearity distortion, casted transformers using oxygen-free copper wire for transformer winding, copper-foil styrene capacitors to reduce DC resistance and inductance, gold-plated terminals with high conductivity, and electrolytic capacitors for large-capacity audio.<br><br>The center of the front panel is equipped with a large FL display that combines a level meter with peak hold, a 4-digit electronic counter, and various indicators to indicate the operation status of the deck.<br><br>Equipped with a 4-digit electronic counter with automatic switching between deck I and II that automatically displays the counter of the deck on the operating side when the cassette half is put in and out.<br><br>It is equipped with a parallel recording function that can record one source simultaneously to the tapes of Decks I and II.<br><br>It is equipped with twin recording re-quick reverse &amp; relay recording function which enables continuous recording of 3 hours. After continuous recording of A face and B face, relay recording from Deck I to Deck II is possible.<br>It is also equipped with a skip function that automatically detects and fast-forwards non-recording parts such as the tape end to minimize the sound interruption time, a blank search function that automatically detects the head of non-recording parts of already recorded tapes to make additional recording easier, a jump selection function of 15 songs in front and back that can be specified regardless of the tape travel direction, an auto REC mute function that creates a 4-second silent part when a button is pressed during recording and automatically enters the recording pause state, double-speed copy / sync start / sync stop for quick tape copying, timer recording / playback functions, and an auto tape selector that automatically sets the equalizer and bias according to the type of tape.</p>
