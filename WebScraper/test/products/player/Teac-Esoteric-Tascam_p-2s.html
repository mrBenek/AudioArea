				<p class="detail">CD transport using new VRDS which is a further review of TEAC&#39;s original VRDS mechanism.<br><br>The mechanism part is equipped with a new Vibr-Free Rigid Disc-Clamping System (VRDS).<br>In the VRDS, a clamper precisely adjusted to a turntable with the same diameter as the disk and a slight taper angle is used to crimp the disk, thereby correcting warpage and distortion of the disk and eliminating unnecessary vibration.<br>In addition, the pickup adjusted to the same angle as the turntable makes it possible to read a minute pit at the center of the pickup optical axis at all times.<br>In the new VRDS adopted in the P-2s, the turntable has been changed from the conventional zinc die-cast to a machined brass + aluminum double structure. By using two different metals together, unnecessary resonance is eliminated. In addition, the machining accuracy has been improved not only on the but also all surfaces has been improved. Combined with the newly adopted 6 mm φ shaft, the mechanism that boasts high precision has been completed.<br>This turntable uses a clamper with a high-precision helicoid to reduce resonance frequency and vibration mode.<br>A high-torque brushless Hall motor using a samarium-cobalt magnet with a high magnetic flux density drives rotation with high precision.<br><br>Zinc die-cast is also used for the mechanical base and motor bearing bridge that support the entire mechanism. The bearing bridge has a newly designed reinforced rib structure, making it twice as heavy as P-2.<br><br>Equipped with ST-link and balanced digital outputs of Line 5.<br>The ST Link uses an AT&amp;T optical conversion module ODL50. The body is shielded by gold-plated die-cast for smooth sound.<br>Balance output is available from the XLR jacks, enabling high-quality playback with noise cancelled.<br>Equipped with coaxial connector for BNC high frequency, terminals such as RCA and TOS link.<br><br>Uses a heavy class double chassis structure.<br>It has excellent vibration damping property by firmly joining with aluminum machined front panel of 18 mm thick part.<br><br>The opening of the tray part is designed to be as narrow as possible, and the total body strength is improved by keeping switches to the minimum necessary.<br>In addition, the Nextel specification aluminum machined disk tray is used to protect the disk.<br>The gold-plated tray top has a silver engraving.<br><br>CN servo is used in the servo circuit to reduce vibration to the actuator.<br>The P-2s uses an LC filter module to rapidly filter the band that causes unnecessary vibration, and reduces the servo current by approximately 60 dB to eliminate vibration of the optical system mechanism and improve quietness.<br><br>Equipped with DVSC (Disc-Tray Variable Speed Control) mechanism, high precision pulse detection servo motor can freely change the speed of the tray IN/OUT independently.<br>Speed is controlled by the volume on the side panel.<br><br>The transmission line uses PCOCC, which has excellent characteristics for pulse and digital signal transmission and good band balance.<br>The circuit board is a glass epoxy substrate with gold-plated patterns and double-sided through holes that are highly durable and resistant to aging.<br><br>The brightness of the display is adjustable continuously with the volume on the side panel to your preference.<br>The display can also be turned ON/OFF by remote control.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
