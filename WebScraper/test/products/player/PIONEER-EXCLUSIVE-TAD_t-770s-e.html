				<p class="detail">This is a stereo cassette deck equipped with a wide range system that inherits the T-1100S broadband concept, Dolby S S and FLAT SYSTEM.<br><br>It is equipped with a wide range system and realizes high frequency characteristics of 25 kHz when metal tape is used.<br>To increase the bandwidth, we have adopted high-quality recording / reproducing heads and increased the bandwidth of the recording / reproducing amplifier. By increasing the peak of the resonance point of the equalizer from about 22 kHz to 25 kHz, the transient response characteristics have been greatly improved.<br><br>The power supply section is designed to have low impedance, and the output impedance is less than 0.001 Ω.<br>As a result, the transient response characteristics have been improved along with the wider bandwidth of the amplifier section.<br><br>Equipped with Dolby S as a noise reduction system.<br>Noise reduction effects of up to 24 dB in the high-frequency range and up to 10 dB in the low-frequency range have been achieved. In addition, the ability to reproduce micro-level sound has been improved and bleeding noise has been reduced.<br><br>The FLAT SYSTEM is installed to bring out the performance of the tape, and the bias, equalizer and sensitivity are adjusted at three points : low band (400 hz), middle and high band (3 khz) and ultra high band (15 khz).<br>A microcomputer with a resolution of 64 steps for the bias, 16 steps for the mid-range equalizer, and 32 steps for the recording level adjusts automatically in a short time. It can also be adjusted manually according to your preference.<br><br>Equipped with a last memory function, you can store FLAT SYSTEM bias, equalizer sensitivity data, Dolby NR, meter range, switch on/off position, electronic counter numbers, etc.<br><br>In order to prevent degradation of sound quality caused by the internal structure such as vibration, distortion due to subtle deformation of the chassis, and inflow of noise from the signal path, the internal structure is divided into three parts with two inner chassis and midship mount structure with a tape drive mechanism in the center is adopted.<br>In addition, the audio system is separated from the FL display, control circuit, power transformer and audio system, which are sources of noise, in order to prevent the influence of noise. In the audio system, the reproduction circuit and recording circuit are separated, and the signal path is to eliminate signal interference.<br><br>The entire tape transport section is tilted by 10 °, and a slant mechanism is adopted to reduce the load on the capstan bearing and the shaft vibration. This realizes the smooth rotation of the heavy-weight flywheel supported by the bearing freely and softly and eliminates the small vibration in the axial direction.<br>In addition, FG (Fine Grain) metal is used for the capstan bearing on the take-up side to improve the bearing loss by approximately 10% compared with conventional oilless metal to ensure stable tape travel.<br><br>In order to eliminate vibration and resonance, we have taken anti-vibration measures such as cassette stabilizers, door pockets made of high-density materials, insulated doors that block external vibration, and panel stabilizers.<br><br>Equipped with digital tension control that automatically adjusts the tape winding torque.<br><br>The head is equipped with a laser amorphous head that uses PC-OCC (single-crystal high-purity oxygen-free copper) winding.<br><br>Equipped with a CD-DECK synchro function, editing and recording can be performed in conjunction with a Pioneer CD player with a CD-DECK synchro function.<br><br>Equipped with SR terminals that enable linkage with Pioneer systems.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
