				<p class="detail">A 280 mm wide MD deck that can be connected to a PC for MD editing.<br><br>A wide bit stream technology has been introduced, and the newly developed 4.5 generation DSP for ATRAC is used as a key device. The signal processing of digital data up to the A/D converter, sampling rate converter, and D/A converter is performed with over 16-bit accuracy to improve sound quality.<br><br>For the DSP for the 4.5 generation ATRAC, we have newly developed an adaptive high-frequency control technology to improve high-frequency reproducibility and natural sound spread. This technology effectively uses limited data based on the human auditory sense. In response to an input signal, if the number of quantization bits is small, the high-frequency range is limited and the number of quantization bits is increased for a signal that feels distorted, and if the number of quantization bits is small, the high-frequency range is limited and the number of quantization bits is increased. In response to a signal containing a complex frequency component that is less affected by the lack of quantization bits, the reproduction band is extended to higher frequencies to improve high-frequency reproducibility.<br>The signal processing system has been improved by the combination of this adaptive high-frequency control technology and the extension of the operation word length in the wide bit stream, and the total harmonic distortion rate has been improved by about 8 dB compared to the conventional system.<br><br>It is equipped with a sampling rate converter that automatically converts 32 kHz and 48 kHz sampling frequency to 44.1 kHz.<br><br>It is equipped with a music sync function. When you press the music sync button on the remote control and the connected device starts playing, it senses the input of a music signal and automatically starts recording.<br><br>It is equipped with a time machine recording function. If you press the multi-jog dial in the recording pause state, the sound recorded on the disc is traced back to the sound of up to 6 seconds before.<br><br>Equipped with a monaural recording and playback function that allows the disc to be used twice as long as the display.<br><br>It has a TOC EDTI function that allows you to divide, combine, and move songs. It also has an UNDO function that allows you to cancel the last edit and redo it.<br>It is also equipped with a rehearsal function so that you can make decisions while checking edit points in COMBINE or DIVIDE. You can move edit points finely by minute, second, or frame (approximately 0.01 second).<br><br>Equipped with the A-B ERASE function that allows you to easily erase between two specified points in a song.<br><br>It is equipped with a title function that can record up to 1,700 characters of disc names and song titles on the disc.<br>In addition to conventional alphabets, numbers and symbols, katakana characters can also be input, and input can be done from the main body or remote controller.<br><br>The SCMS (Serial Copy Management System) allows digital recording only for one generation and does not allow digital recording for two or more generations.<br><br>Connection with a PC is possible by using MD-PC link kit PCLK-MD1 (sold separately).<br>This allows you to perform basic MD deck operations, disc editing, and kanji / hiragana character input.<br><br>It is equipped with a smart space function that automatically adjusts silence periods of 3 seconds or more to approximately 3 seconds during digital recording.<br><br>Equipped with a timer standby function which can record and play back by combining with a timer sold separately.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.<br><br>There are 2 variations, black and silver.</p>
