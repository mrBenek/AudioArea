				<p class="detail">Stereo cassette deck equipped with dbx and Dolby B and C.<br><br>A dbx system is installed as a noise reduction system.<br>The dbx system records music signals by compressing them linearly at a ratio of 1/2 and expands them twice during playback. This system increases the recording saturation level by more than 10 dB compared to the normal one, and achieves a noise reduction effect of more than 30 dB over the entire audio band. It also solves the problem of the cassette, in which the high-frequency characteristics deteriorate with high-level input.<br>In addition, the RS-M265XC can also play dbx records by manipulating the NR selector.<br><br>In addition to dbx, Dolby B and CNR are also installed.<br>The Dolby C NR further improves the quality of the Dolby B NR. It has a new structure with an anti- saturation circuit, etc., and the noise reduction effect is designed to appear from the middle range. In addition, clipping and distortion are suppressed in the high range, and the noise reduction effect of 20 dB at 10 kHz is realized.<br><br>The mechanism section is equipped with a compact 2-motor mechanism that introduces our own thin design concept and slims the deck body.<br>In addition to improving tape running performance by adopting a capstan with high roundness, it is a 2-motor system equipped with an electronically controlled DC motor for driving the capstan and reel, and a dedicated motor for the ff/rew. The ff/rew motor is designed to operate the head block, and the head touch is made smooth by displacing a large plunger from the head block.<br><br>It uses computer logic control to realize accurate control of tape running.<br>Direct change from ff or rew to play is also possible.<br><br>The recording / reproducing head is equipped with an AX amorphous head that uses amorphous alloy as a material.<br>By finishing the AX head with an amorphous alloy with low high-frequency loss and high saturation magnetic flux density, superior frequency characteristics and strain characteristics are obtained.<br>A double-gap ferrite head with high erasing capability is used for the erasing head.<br><br>A newly developed IC circuit is used for the read / write amplifier to ensure flat characteristics and high SN ratio.<br><br>It is equipped with an intro search that plays only the intro part of a song for about 10 seconds.<br>This function uses a system that detects the unrecorded part between songs, passes it once, and instantly rewinds it at the beginning of the song, so that the performance of the intro part starts from the exact beginning of the song.<br>An indicator shows the operation status of the introsearch.<br><br>With the 20-track jump selection function, you can start and play the music you want to listen to.<br><br>Equipped with a memory repeat function in three modes : from the beginning to the end of the tape, from the beginning to the optional 000 position, and from the optional 000 position to the end.<br><br>Equipped with a 4-way digital counter, it is possible to display the remaining amount of the tape in real time, display the elapsed time when re-muting in units of minutes and seconds, display the tape count by 3-digit numbers and 4 bars that light up in a loop according to the tape running, and display the instruction music with 20 jumps.<br><br>Equipped with an auto tape selector that automatically sets to the optimum tape position.<br><br>Equipped with an auto input selector that automatically switches to microphone input when the microphone plug is turned on.<br><br>It is equipped with a wide range 3-color FL display compatible with dbx. The display is divided into 3 colors from -40dB to + 18 db.<br>When the NR selector is set to the dbx position, the signal of + 8 dB or more is illuminated in red to accurately indicate the movement of dbx.<br><br>Timer recording is possible by connecting a separately sold timer.<br><br>It is equipped with functions such as rec pause, rec mute, output volume, and soft eject.<br><br>There are 2 variations, silver and black.</p>
