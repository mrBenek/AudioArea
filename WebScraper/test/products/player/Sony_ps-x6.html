				<p class="detail">A full auto player that uses a slotless motor and crystal lock.<br><br>It adopts a direct drive system in which a motor directly turns the turntable. The motor is equipped with a newly developed linear slotless motor.<br>In principle, the Cono Motor uses a linear drive system with very little torque unevenness, thus achieving smooth and quiet rotation. In addition, a large torque can be obtained efficiently by using a balanced air-core coil and magnet ring.<br><br>The servo detector uses a unique Sony magne-disk rotational speed detection system that incorporates the technology of the Sony Magne-scale precision measuring instrument.<br>A wide range of 512 wave velocity detection signals are magnetized around the periphery of the turntable, and the average value of these signals is detected by an 8-tooth multi-gap head. This detection method greatly improves the start-up characteristics and realizes stable rotation that is resistant to disturbance.<br><br>In order to further pursue rotational speed accuracy, the crystal lock adopted for PS 8750 is adopted.<br>The difference from the conventional servo circuit of this method is that the phase control circuit of the crystal oscillation is added to the speed servo circuit detected by the magnesium disk. By phase locking the signal detected by the frequency accuracy of the crystal oscillation, the initial drift due to self-heating of the main body, the shift of the rotation speed due to changes in ambient temperature and power supply voltage, and the decrease of the rotation speed due to needle pressure load are suppressed to the detection limit.<br><br>The cabinet uses SBMC, which has high internal loss and is hard to resonate. It is reinforced at important points to realize an integrally molded cabinet without resonance parts.<br>In addition, a large insulator with a rubber cup filled with a gel-like highly viscoelastic material is used to suppress howling.<br>In addition, since the height can be adjusted and the center of gravity position is low, stability is also improved.<br><br>A precision pivot bearing is used for the bearing part of the tone arm to increase sensitivity. Each joint part is supported by a damper, and the arm support part is fixed to a zinc die-cast arm base to eliminate resonance.<br>In addition, it is equipped with an inside for scan seller and lateral balancer.<br>In addition, the head shell uses an aluminum die-cast head shell with a slide bar.<br><br>Uses a rotatable arm rest.<br><br>Equipped with an oil dump type arm lifter.<br><br>The cartridge is equipped with XL-15 which was sold separately.<br>In addition, a newly designed thick special rubber sheet is used to absorb unnecessary vibration during tracing.<br><br>An aluminum die-cast turntable is used for the turntable.<br>In addition, it is equipped with a peripheral strobe with a stroboscopic illumination prism that makes it easy to see the stroboscopic pattern. Since 120 unique pulses are sent from a crystal oscillator to the neon tube, the stroboscopic pattern is sharp enough to appear stationary.<br><br>2-speed switching is possible.<br><br>Uses a low-capacity phono cord.<br><br>Equipped with 2 replacement shell stands.<br><br>Luminous sensor type return mechanism is adopted.<br>In this method, a shutter connected directly to the arm is provided between the lamp and the photoelectric element, and the light emitted from the lamp is received by the photoelectric element, and the position of the arm is detected by the amount of light and changes.<br>As a result, the side pressure applied to the needle tip, which could not be removed by the conventional mechanical method, can be reduced to 0, enabling light needle pressure tracing.<br>The Luminous sensor return return method uses both speed and position detection, it is possible to start the performance from the last bar.<br><br>Quick action mechanism is adopted for accurate auto operation, and quick tone arm response operation is realized.<br><br>It uses an arm limiter mechanism to realize a safe auto mechanism that can withstand unexpected accidents such as manually stopping the tone arm during Oatley turn operation or switching the size selector.<br><br>Equipped with auto-queuing (auto-down function) for manual operation.<br><br>It uses an electronic touch switch and LED.<br><br>Comes with a removable acrylic dust cover.</p>
