				<p class="detail">Rotary head type auto reverse deck equipped with dbxNR.<br><br>A rotary head system is adopted as the reverse system.<br>Since the same head is used for both FWD and REV, this rotary head system has the advantage that the characteristics of both sides can be exactly unified. On the other hand, the head must be rotated mechanically, and high precision and durability are required for the rotating part.<br>The newly developed A. R. H. S. (Acculine ローティティング Head System) has been adopted in order to make this rotary head system perfect. In this A. R. H. S., the head holder and bearing part of the rotary part are made of high-precision die cast with high shock absorption power and light weight, processed in order of microns. This realizes a quiet rotational sound, reduces shocks and eliminates deviations in azimuth. In addition, by changing the diameters of the capstan and pinch roller and dispersing the wow flutter cycle, excellent stable running, improved wow flutter, and reduced modulation noise have been realized.<br><br>It has a reflective IR (infrared) sensor to increase the reverse speed of the reverse deck.<br>The IR sensor reduces time loss due to reflection by quickly optically detecting the semi-transparent tape attached to the end of the tape.<br><br>The head uses a CA (cobalt amorphous) head using LC-OFC winding.<br>By using the thin foil characteristic of amorphous alloy with no crystal structure, this head has realized a 13-layer laminate structure that is approximately four times larger than that of conventional Sendust heads. The ribbon-shaped amorphous alloy greatly reduces eddy current loss, improves MOL with excellent magnetic properties, achieves flat high-frequency characteristics, and achieves high wear resistance without grain boundary peeling.<br><br>Most of the amplifier system from the input to the output of the signal is concentrated on a single board using many ICs, and by directly connecting the boards of the display and switches, noise prevention and wire shortening are realized.<br>In addition, by carefully selecting parts such as aluminum electrolytic capacitors for high-sound audio and high-performance film capacitors, we minimize signal turbidity and degradation.<br>The REC, PB, PB, and NR sections are each made into blocks to completely separate the power supply for the amplifier system from the power supply for the mechanism system. The transformer winding is also completely separated to prevent deterioration of sound quality due to mutual noise interference.<br><br>Dbx NR is installed as a noise reduction system.<br>The R-616X uses a symmetrical integrated one chip LSI to achieve higher one chip LSI to eliminate variations in parts and achieve minimum sound quality degradation.<br><br>The Dolby B/C is also equipped with a noise reduction system.<br><br>Equipped with Dolby HX Pro.<br>The Dolby HX Pro detects the signal components of 10 kHz or higher and automatically controls the bias to decrease when the high-level recording reaches a plateau due to saturation of the tape. This makes it possible to expand the high-range recording just like low-level recording. Ordinary tapes can be recorded at a grade close to that of tapes with excellent high-range characteristics.<br>This function can also be played on devices without Dolby HX Pro.<br><br>A specially programmed LSI is mounted on the operation part to realize speedy control.<br>As a system control, it judges various input states, determines the operation mode, and transmits it to the mechanical controller. It also reliably controls counter display, memory operation and CPS.<br>The mechanism control controls the CAM motor to the specified position, controls the REEL motor, controls the amplifier control output, and displays the operation mode.<br><br>Equipped with a bias fine function, the ability of the tape is brought out by adjusting the recording condition which differs depending on the tape to the optimum value.<br><br>Equipped with a compact disc level check function.<br>This function allows you to check the level of the entire song while keeping the CD player in the fast-forward state. Normally, the CD player is fast-forwarded with the level lowered by 12 dB. By returning the level to the original level and displaying it on the meter, accurate monitoring is possible.<br><br>It is equipped with a random program function of up to 15 songs, and it is possible to select only arbitrary songs and play programs stored in memory.<br><br>It is equipped with CPS system, and you can choose 15 songs before and after.<br>In reverse mode, both A and B can be selected.<br><br>It has an intro-check function, and you can play the head of each song for 15 seconds one after another.<br>If you press the Play button, it is played as it is.<br><br>Equipped with a 2-way counter, tape counter and tape run timer can be selected with one touch.<br><br>Equipped with a block repeat function, you can repeat playback between blocks specified by Start Memo and Stop Memo.<br><br>Equipped with a blank scan function, it automatically fast-forwards and restarts silence periods of approximately 10 seconds or more.<br><br>Equipped with FL multi-function display.</p>
