				<p class="detail">A CD transport that pursues accurate signal pickup to the limit and ensures silence in every sense.<br><br>We have developed and adopted a unique &quot;Twin Link Method&quot; to eliminate the clock disturbance that occurs during the signal transmission from the player to the D/A converter.<br>In this system, the crystal oscillator for generating the master clock, which was conventionally installed in the player side, is installed in the D/A conversion section. This eliminates jitter from the clock at the time of D/A conversion and reduces phase distortion.<br>In this twin-link system, optical round-trip cables are used. One cable is used for data transmission in the same way as before, and the other cable is used for synchronous signal transmission from DAS to CDP in the reverse way.<br>We also use highly reliable and highly transparent silica-based optical fibers.<br><br>The servo system employs a TS servo system designed not to respond more than necessary to fine irregularities caused by disc scratches or vibration disturbance.<br>This circuit consists of an ordinary servo LSI and a TS compensator. The TS compensator continuously monitors the fluctuation of the pit string on the disk and eliminates the fluctuation that cannot be inherent in the pit string. Therefore, sound does not easily skip at the flaw, returns to the pit string after passing through the flaw, and increases the amount of information read from the disk.<br>In addition, since the servo current is small, the load fluctuation of the power supply part is small, which also contributes to the sound quality improvement.<br><br>The mechanism section employs a linear tracking mechanism that Sony is proud of.<br>In CDP-R1, aluminum die-cast is used for the housing of this mechanism to ensure sufficient strength and high accuracy.<br><br>The FB chassis is composed of a frame that goes around the circumference and several beams that connect the frames before and after the frame. Each component with sufficient thickness and strength is reasonably and firmly jointed so that almost all the strength is ensured by the frame and beam alone.<br>In addition, most of the mechanism and printed circuit board are fixed directly on the most vibrationally neutral beam without using any special metal fittings. By equalizing the strength of the entire body, the sound resonance is controlled.<br><br>The power supply consists of two transformers : one power transformer with sufficient capacity and a choke transformer for noise reduction.<br>The choke transformer acts as a kind of filter that blocks the digital noise leaking from the CD player and prevents noise from entering the AC line, which is the only electrical contact for optical transmission.<br><br>Features include Program Performance / Program Bank, Custom Index with up to 6 indexes at any position on the disc, Repeat Performance with Full / One Specified Song / Programmed Song / Shuffle Play / Specified Between A and B / Custom Index, AMS with the ability to recall the beginning of the current or next song, and Direct Selection with the ability to recall a specified song.<br><br>It has a coaxial output terminal that can be connected to a normal D/A converter unit.<br>This uses a latched digital system that reduces clock jitter.<br><br>It comes with a wireless remote control and includes only the minimum number of buttons.</p>
