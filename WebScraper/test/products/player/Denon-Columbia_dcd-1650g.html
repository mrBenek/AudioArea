				<p class="detail">A CD player with a Lambda S. L. C4D/A converter.<br><br>The D/A converter is equipped with a 4D/A converter of Lambda S. L. C.<br>Lambda is an abbreviation of LAMBDA (Ladder-from Multiple Bias D/A). It uses a newly developed LSI to divide digital data into two systems, each of which is shifted by applying a digital bias in the + and - directions near the 0 cross point to eliminate the 0 cross distortion in principle.<br>In this method, when the digital data is smaller than the shift amount, there is no value crossing the original 0 cross point, so there is no 0 cross distortion. Furthermore, by adding the two data after D/A conversion, the DC component is removed and the two data are combined. Thus, an analog output with no 0 cross distortion can be obtained. These two data have no MSB inversion and no 0 cross distortion in the combined waveform. Moreover, even if there is an error in any bit, the distortion is reduced to 1/2 by averaging the two signals.<br>In addition, if the digital data is at a level larger than the shift amount, it will cross the original 0 cross point, which may cause distortion. However, this distortion is also removed by the MSB correction of the S. L. C (Super Linear Converter). In addition, when there is no shift operation or only a few times in a single song at the peak level (approximately 99.6% or more of the maximum level), the lambda function stops shifting operations and uses the converter&#39;s dynamic range to ensure a wide dynamic range.<br>The DCD 1650 uses a differential amplifier configuration to improve the S/N ratio and distortion factor as well as to enhance the ability to reproduce small signals. Moreover, the output of one side of the lambda processor is delayed by a half period of 8 fs and combined at the output stage of the D/A converter to achieve the same operation as 16 fs. This allows unwanted noise to be shifted to the higher frequency range, and combined with the use of a GIC analog filter to improve the phase characteristics.<br><br>The digital filter is equipped with an 8 x oversampling digital filter. By raising the sampling frequency by 8 x, the high-frequency noise of 24.1 kHz or higher included in the output of the converter is shifted to the higher range, making it easier to remove with the analog filter.<br><br>The analog circuits after the D/A converter are designed to be independent on the left and right sides. Moreover, the analog circuits are completely independent on the L/R according to the signal flow, thereby eliminating interference between channels.<br><br>The power supply section uses a large power transformer and a large-capacity smoothing capacitor.<br><br>Aluminum extruded material is used for the top cover.<br><br>Power cord with polarity display is used.<br><br>Equipped with Denon&#39;s own digital pitch commander, the playback pitch of CDs can be changed up to ± 12.0%.<br>This feature allows the digital PLL to adjust the pitch of the CD playback in 0.1% increments.<br><br>It is equipped with peak search which can find the maximum recording level of the disk with one touch operation.<br><br>Equipped with a time specifying type time edit function and a 2-segment type auto edit function.<br><br>It is equipped with a fader function that allows you to fade in / out at your favorite place or fade out at a specified time during performance.<br><br>It is equipped with up to 20 program plays.<br><br>Display brightness can be changed to 4 levels.<br><br>It is equipped with a remote control electric volume that can be used as headphones.<br><br>There are 2 kinds of variations, black type DCD 1650 and gold type DCD 1650 g.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
