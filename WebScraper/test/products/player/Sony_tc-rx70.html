				<p class="detail">This is a quick reverse deck with excellent operability and high sound quality that exceeds the price.<br><br>Equipped with a sound auto-focus function that detects the tape type and presence of Dolby NR and allows the computer to automatically set the appropriate recording level.<br>The settings are made in the recording standby mode. However, if there is an excessive input during recording, the volume is gradually reduced so as not to leave an unnatural impression in the music. Furthermore, if the volume is set to 0 during timer recording, a fade-in recording is automatically performed as soon as recording starts, and the sound auto-focus function is activated.<br>By adopting a motor drive volume for the volume, the sound quality is equivalent to that of a manual machine.<br><br>The mechanism section is equipped with a newly developed mechanical deck TCM-200R for the reverse machine, inheriting the design concept of the mechanical deck for the ES series. It provides quiet and speedy operation and stable tape running characteristics. In addition, it is equipped with a cassette stabilizer that firmly holds the cassette without being affected by the unevenness of the half. This suppresses harmful vibration during tape running and suppresses modulation noise.<br><br>It uses power loading. If you put the tape in the cassette lid and press the operation button such as play or rewind without closing the door, the tape will be loaded automatically and enter the operation mode.<br><br>The head uses an LC-OFC wound laser amorphous head that takes advantage of the magnetic properties of amorphous magnetic alloys and employs an LC-OFC (linear crystalline oxygen-free copper) in the head winding of the original laser amorphous head. This reduces distortion due to capacitive reactances and reduces loss in the mid-range and high-range.<br><br>Equipped with the Dolby HX-PRO, the effective bias amount is controlled to the optimum value in 1/1000 second increments to prevent over-bias in the high-frequency range and improve linearity in the high-frequency range. This function works only during recording, so it is effective even when played on a deck without the Dolby HX-PRO.<br><br>Super-bias is adopted, and by shifting up the bias frequency greatly, the frequency difference with the music signal is expanded, and beat noise and intermodulation distortion due to interference between the bias frequency and the music signal are suppressed.<br><br>Equipped with Dolby NR B-C type.<br><br>By using the included wireless remote control, you can record in sync without connecting a sync cord to a CD player supported by Sony&#39;s remote control.<br><br>Equipped with FL tube adoption linear electronic counter with subtraction function of minute and second display.<br><br>It is equipped with a wide range peak program meter that displays real-time peak values in the range of -40dB to + 8 dB and also has a peak hold function.<br><br>Equipped with a display ON/OFF switch, three modes can be selected : all lights, counter only, and all lights.<br><br>Equipped with an auto-fader function, you can fade in or out from the position where you press the auto-fade button.<br>In addition, you can also fade in by recording messages in conjunction with the timer.<br><br>It is equipped with a quick Oatley birth function that realizes quick action with almost no sound cut when reversing the tape.<br><br>Equipped with AMS (Automatic Music Sensor) function that can quickly find the beginning of the previous or next music.<br><br>Equipped with an auto tape selector that automatically detects whether the tape being used is type I (normal), II (high position), or IV (metal).<br><br>Equipped with an autoplay function that automatically starts playing after rewinding, and a memory play function that starts playing from the position reset to counter 0.<br><br>Timer recording and alarm clock playback are possible by combining the separately sold timer.<br><br>Equipped with a Rec Mute function with auto-space that automatically mutes for approximately 4 seconds.</p>
