				<p class="detail">This is a super-class model that has been completely improved from the 1000 and 1000 II which have a track record of professional use all over the world.<br><br>Includes Azimuth, Bias, Level, and Equalizer (A. B. L. E) to adjust for small differences between tapes, such as optimal bias and sensitivity.<br>It is an 8-bit resolution microcomputer that adjusts the bias, level and equalizer in 256 steps for each left and right channel, eliminating the need for a tape selector.<br>The adjusted tape achieves a high specification with a frequency response of 20 to 20000 Hz ± 0.75 dB (18 to 25000 Hz ± 3 dB) at a recording level of -20dB.<br><br>Equipped with RAMM (Ramdom Access Music Memory), a playback system that can play back songs recorded on a tape in any order or in any order of preference. This system sequentially records music order address signals encoded by a microcomputer during recording. During playback, this code is read and played back in the order programmed by the listener.<br>In addition, information such as the playback equalizer position (70 μ s/120 μ s) set at the time of recording and whether or not external connection noise reduction such as Dolby Noise Reduction in/out or High ComII is used is recorded at the same time. This eliminates the need to operate the playback equalizer switch and noise reduction switch when playing back a recorded tape with a RAMM code signal.<br>Since the code signal uses a very low frequency of 5 ± 0.1 Hz, it does not affect the playback sound.<br><br>In order to reduce the modulation noise caused by the elasticity of the tape and friction with the head, and to obtain stable tape running, uniform tape tension, and stable head touch, we adopted a double capstan system and equipped with a tape pad softer.<br>Furthermore, the two capstan diameters are different, 3 mm on the supply side and 2.5 mm on the take-up side, so that the flutter cycle does not overlap with the flutter cycle to suppress noise.<br><br>In order to dampen vibrations generated by motors and other rotating bodies, the chassis is made of aluminum alloy, which has much higher damping characteristics than iron, and resin is out-plated to prevent resonance by suppressing harmful microvibrations.<br><br>The tape control by C-MOS logic is adopted, and unlike the electronic control, the cam is driven by a motor without using a self-contained plunger. This is a unique method.<br>As a result, the sound at the time of operation is very low compared with the plunger-driven type. Damage to the tape and the tape transport can be minimized because the software can contact the tape. There is no temperature rise in the machine. Current consumption can be reduced.<br><br>The head uses a discrete 3-head system.<br>The P-8L-type read head is used for the read head, and a laminated crystal layer is used to reduce the size and narrow gap of 0.6 microns. It eliminates many losses during playback and enables playback in the high-frequency range up to 25 kHz.<br><br>The recording head uses an R-8L catalogue sound head with a 3.5 micron gap with a crystal-laminated core and a life of over 10,000 hours, the same as that of the reproducing head.<br><br>E-8L type erase head is used for the erase head. Double gap ferrite core with Sendust on the front. In addition, the small allowable bias current is divided by 1/2 of the frequency from the bias oscillator using quartz, and 52.5 kHz is used. This reduces eddy current loss of the erase head. The erase current can be increased, greatly improving the erase effect. In addition, the erase rate in the low range is remarkably improved.<br><br>The playback amplifier is connected directly between the playback head and the first stage amplifier, and the equalizer circuit is a double-NF circuit to stabilize DC and reduce distortion.<br><br>The recording equalizer amplifier is connected directly to a group amplifier and a recording head, and employs a double NF circuit to reduce distortion during recording. The recording input can be mixed with a 3-point microphone input (L, R, and Blend (center)) and a line input. You can use either a subsonic filter or MPX filter alone or both simultaneously.<br><br>It is equipped with pitch control that can adjust the speed of the tape by ± 6% during playback for adjusting the pitch of the music.<br><br>The MOL (maximum output level) characteristic can be changed without changing the frequency characteristic by switching the bias current to 3 types of Under/Normal/Over depending on the state of the music source.<br><br>3 microphone inputs of L channel, R channel L channel, R channel, and blend (center) and line input.<br><br>Built-in Dolby noise reduction. Also, external noise reduction terminal such as High-Com II is installed and it can be switched with the switch on the front panel.<br><br>Equipped with high-output headphone terminal.</p>
