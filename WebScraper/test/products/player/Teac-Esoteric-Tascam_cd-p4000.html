				<p class="detail">A CD-player that uses Mash 1-bit DAC.<br><br>Mash 1-bit DAC is used for the D/A conversion part.<br>This system is based on a clock generated by ultra-precision crystal oscillation. The vertical axis (vibration axis) is fixed at 1 bit and the horizontal axis (time axis) is highly accurate. As a result, the noise shaping system of the D/A conversion system with excellent differential linearity with very little gradation error has been realized, and the audible band resolution equivalent to 18 bits has been obtained.<br>In the CD-P4000, by adopting this system, the 0 cross distortion which cannot be avoided in multi-bit is theoretically reduced to 0, and excellent linearity at low levels is obtained. In addition, high S/N ratio is obtained by minimizing quantization noise in the audible band.<br><br>The digital filter is equipped with an 18-bit 4 x oversampling digital filter.<br><br>The servo mechanism uses a CN servo, and by filtering the drive voltage to the actuator with a high-precision low-pass filter, unnecessary noise components other than the servo current are minimized.<br><br>It is equipped with Diack&#39;s own T. F. H. S. (Track Focus Holding System).<br>This circuit accurately reads the tracking error signal (up / down) and the focus error signal (left / right) when there is a scratch or dirt on the disk surface, so that the pickup retains the trace signal just before the scratch or dirt. After passing through the scratch or dirt, the pickup immediately starts reading the pits on the same track, preventing sound skipping and ensuring stable pickup ability even against black dots.<br><br>The front panel, which is susceptible to direct sound pressure from speakers, is made of aluminum pull-out material with sufficient thickness and weight. This material is made into a double structure and is firmly joined to the bonnet made of thick steel treated with PVC. Only the necessary keys are placed on the front panel, and the effect of sound pressure is eliminated by minimizing the opening.<br><br>It uses a digital volume that can be controlled by a remote control.<br><br>With a built-in time edit function, you can automatically program the music that enters the A and B sides just by entering the length of the tape when you dub the tape.<br><br>Equipped with a CD sync mechanism, you can do synchronized dubbing of CD and cassette just by connecting to the cassette deck of the teac.<br><br>It is equipped with functions such as index search, random memory program of up to 20 songs, delete program, music skip, music search, queue lock, and repeat one song / all songs / program / A to B.<br><br>Equipped with an auto space function, you can set a song interval of approximately 4 seconds.<br><br>Equipped with 3-mode time counter function, it is possible to display elapsed time, remaining time of one song and total remaining time.<br><br>Equipped with a timer play function, it is possible to start playing from the desired time using an optional timer.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
