				<p class="detail">A CD player with an 8fs18-bit linear D/A converter.<br><br>The D/A converter is equipped with an 8fs18-bit linear D/A converter.<br><br>A direct digital sink is included to eliminate jittering issues.<br>The CDP-M99 is equipped with a digital sync IC. The voltage and time axis of the digital signal is adjusted to the accuracy of a clean master clock without jitter and output to the D/A converter, enabling D/A conversion with accurate phase.<br><br>The servo circuit is equipped with S Servo III.<br>In the S Servo III, the high-frequency noise component of the servo current is removed with a low-pass filter to supply a smooth servo current, which stabilizes the power supply from the power supply and prevents adverse effects on sound quality.<br><br>A digital CLV servo is installed in the drive system servo circuit that controls disk rotation.<br>The digital CLV servo detects the rotation of the spindle motor and controls it with 10-bit resolution to maintain an accurate linear velocity regardless of the disk&#39;s inner or outer circumference. It also detects the difference in inertial mass between the 12 cm CD and 8 cm CD disks to drive more appropriately.<br><br>Low noise and high stability are achieved by incorporating an RF amplifier in the pickup section.<br><br>The digital signal processing LSI uses the fourth generation LSI for the Sony CD player. Previously external RAM has been upgraded to a capacity of 32 kbit and built into the digital signal processing LSI. The precision of the signal processing capability is further enhanced by adopting the strict 6-fold error correction method.<br><br>Aluminum front panel is used for the front panel.<br><br></p>

            <p class="detail">Equipped with a custom edit function, you can use seven functions : peak search, time edit, program edit, multidisk program, time fade, variable fade, and manual fader.<br><br>In peak search, all songs are searched at high speed, and they are repeatedly played for about 4 seconds before and after the point where the volume level is highest.<br><br>Time Edit enables efficient editing of the A-side and B-side when recording tapes.<br>If you want to edit to fit the length of your tape, use the TIME SET button or AMS button to set the length of the tape (you can also use the direct key to set the length in seconds). Press the Edit button. First, program from the first song for side A. When you encounter a time-over song, select the longest song that fits within the time. Then press the Edit button to edit side B.<br>Also, if you select and edit a half disk with the AMS button, tracks are distributed so that the A side and B side of the tape are about the same length without changing the order of the songs.<br><br>Program Edit allows you to manually edit your favorite songs in any order.<br>With the AMS key or direct key, you can program your favorite songs in any order while checking the accumulated time. If you turn on Auto Space at this time, you can edit each song by adding a 3-second blank to the playing time. When you press the pause button, you can program the A side and then the B side together.<br><br>Multidisk programs allow you to edit across multiple disks.<br>When you program in program mode and open the tray, the display &quot;MULTI PGM&quot; appears and the program automatically moves to a multi-disc program. You can program up to 6 discs (24 songs). You can also program poses in the middle of the program.<br><br>Time Fade allows you to fade out at a specified time, which can be set with the TIME SET button or the AMS button.<br><br>You can set the fade-in / fade-out time for the variable fade from 2 seconds to 10 seconds in units of 1 second.<br><br>The manual fader allows you to fade in and fade out at the desired location.<br><br></p>

            <p class="detail">Equipped with a custom file function, you can take advantage of five functions : disk memory, custom index, program bank, last mode memory, and file recall.<br><br>Disk Memo can record up to 10 characters per disk, 78 characters including alphanumeric characters, special symbols and blanks.<br><br>With a custom index, you can index the disc in your own way wherever you want in the index. You can set up to 10 points per disc and fine-tune it in steps of approximately ± 0.15 seconds.<br><br>The program bank allows you to record program performances.<br><br>In the last mode memory, you can store the play mode and fade time set just before removing a disc with a custom file. When the same disc is inserted, that mode is automatically recalled.<br><br>With File Recall, you can check what kind of file was stored.<br>This function can be function even if you don&#39;t have a disc installed, and you can delete unnecessary files on the fly.<br><br></p>
            
            <hr><br><p class="detail">It is equipped with 99 music delete shuffle function, and you can leave only your favorite music and play it randomly.<br><br>Equipped with an auto space function, the space between songs can be adjusted to approximately 3 seconds of silence.<br><br>Equipped with a multi-mode timer that can be combined with an external timer for automatic performance.<br>You can also choose your favorite play mode, such as program play, shuffle play or custom index, and play it on a timer.<br><br>Equipped with an optical digital output.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
