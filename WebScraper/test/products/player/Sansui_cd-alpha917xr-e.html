				<p class="detail">A reference CD player developed using SANSUI technology.<br><br>The DAC section is equipped with a newly developed 18-bit resolution double Mash D/A converter.<br>By improving the read-out accuracy of digital signals and eliminating common-mode noise, the SN ratio is greatly improved. In addition, the SN ratio is improved to solve the distortion increase in the high-frequency range. In addition, the generation of 0 cross distortion and nonlinear distortion is eliminated in principle, improving the ability to reproduce at a minute level.<br>In this method, the read disk signal is digitally processed by balance operation, so no inverting amplifier is required, so there is no phase shift and balance output is less affected by noise.<br><br>The power supply section is equipped with dedicated transformers for both digital and analog circuits. Both circuits are completely separated from each other. In addition, 15 independent power supply systems are used for each circuit such as the microcomputer section, DAC, drive system, display, and analog system. By using a closed circuit that supplies power separately, sound quality degradation caused by mutual interference is prevented.<br>We have also adopted an electrolytic capacitor using low-magnification aluminum foil to improve the quality of the product.<br><br>The internal structure is based on the conventional center mechanical layout. Moreover, it is equipped with a newly developed center dome made of pure copper, which separates the drive part from other circuits by shielding the drive part in the center. This ensures the optimum weight balance of the body, enhances stability and rigidity, minimizes vibration and resonance when driven by the motor. It is also effective in blocking noise from the digital signal pickup part, shielding the power part from radiation, and protecting against wind pressure from rotating disks.<br><br>A special paint mixed with copper powder is used to paint the bonnet to reduce resonance inside the player.<br>In addition, vibration from the outside is cut off by an elliptic insulator, and many Teflon sheets and tapes are used for the main parts such as between the bottom plate and the insulator, and the back panel and center channel are also copper plated. This is a countermeasure against vibration of the casing.<br><br>We use carefully selected parts.<br>The CD - α 917 xr uses Silmic Super Gold capacitors, GSG film capacitors with gold-plated leads, RMG resistors, Sa film capacitors, special Styrol capacitors, and other parts with gold-plated leads and anti-vibration treatment.<br>In addition, the CD Mechanism has been fully equipped with anti-vibration measures, such as copper plating on the play chassis and Teflon coating.<br><br>Using a digital attenuator that reduces sound quality degradation, the player can control the level from 0 dB to -26dB even when connected directly to a power amplifier.<br>You can also fade in and out from the set volume level to silence (- ∞ dB).<br><br>Uses a balanced servo system and a balanced low-pass filter.<br><br>Equipped with a peak search function, you can display the level of the peak point of the disk and play it for 5 seconds.<br><br>In addition to normal output and balanced output, it is equipped with optical and coaxial digital output with ON/OFF switch.<br><br>Equipped with a display ON/OFF function.<br><br>Equipped with auto space and auto pose functions.<br><br>It is equipped with functions such as following memory function, music scan, 5-way repeat.<br><br>It is equipped with real side wood with glossy finish.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
