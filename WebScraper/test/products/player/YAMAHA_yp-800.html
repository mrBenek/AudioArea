				<p class="detail">A record player developed by taking advantage of Yamaha&#39;s experience in player production.<br><br>There were two variations of YP-0 800 : YP-0 800 with SHURE M75EMII cartridge and YP-0 800 cl without cartridge.<br><br>A 31 cm diameter aluminum die-cast turntable has been adopted.<br>It has been carefully finished with ultra-precision processing that takes dynamic balance when rotating, and inertial mass 300 kg ・ cm.<sup>2</sup>In order to eliminate the resonance of the turntable, the outer ribs are reinforced and the turntable itself is finished to be thick. Moreover, the resonance is effectively absorbed by the rubber sheet which is tightly joined to the turntable. This rubber sheet is designed to suppress the resonance of the turntable by selecting the hardness of the material, and is finished into a ring shape so that it fits the record surface in the best condition by examining the shape.<br><br>The drive motor uses a 12-pole 24-slot brushless DC servo motor developed for direct drive.<br>This motor uses a non-contact electronic control system that uses an electronic commutator circuit to control the rotation of the motor. The turntable directly connected to the motor rotor has a mechanism in which the rotation of the motor is transmitted as the constant rotational speed of the record (33 1/3, 45 rpm).<br>In addition, a DC motor that does not vary with the power supply frequency and a highly accurate servomechanism provides high speed stability.<br><br>A touch feeling micro switch is used for speed switching.<br>Electrical contacts enable one touch switching and smooth rotation speed selection. In addition, a speed fine adjustment knob of ± 3% is provided independently for each rotation speed, and accurate rotation speed can be obtained by fine adjustment while checking the strobe at each rotation speed.<br><br>The tone arm uses a light alloy S-shaped pipe arm with gyro-gimbal support for the rotation axis.<br>The main shaft of the rotary bearing of the gyro-gimbal support is integrally molded with zinc die-cast by high-precision machining technology to eliminate play generated from the joint part and improve durability. In addition, the bearing of the bearing is specially selected with high accuracy, and high initial motion sensitivity of 10 mg or less for both vertical and horizontal motion is realized.<br>10 φ light alloy pipe is used for the S-shaped arm.<br><br>The inside four scan cellar uses a counter bar and roller string system. Since it is a thread suspension type, vibration is absorbed and accurate tracing without distortion is guaranteed.<br>Needle pressure adjustment is a direct reading type of 0.1g step from 0 to 3g, and 3g to 24g cartridge can be used by combined use of attached sub-weight.<br><br>The head shell is made of light alloy die-cast with tapered rib to reduce resonance and twist.<br>In addition, 7 mm overhang adjustment and cartridge tilt angle adjustment are possible. In addition, the contact points and pin jacks of this head shell are gold-plated to prevent contact failure.<br><br>The rotary bearing is equipped with an arm lifter of hydraulic piston lever type using silicone oil cylinder to realize smooth lifting of the tone arm.<br><br>The cabinet is made of 15 mm thick laminated plywood with reinforced wood and aluminum die-cast deck panels, and the bottom plate is also made of punching metal with rib processing.<br>Heavyweight molded products are used for the acrylic dust cover.<br>It is a fleece top type with a removable hinge.<br><br>The legs are equipped with large insulators made of specially shaped damper material.<br>It is designed to be able to adjust the height and horizontal of the player body.<br><br>The turntable rotation speed is designed to be monitored by a reflecting mirror with strobe and neon lamp proof inscribed on the back of the turntable.<br>In addition, the deck panel has a built-in level to adjust the horizontal balance of the player body.<br>Low-capacitance lead wires and output cords are used to suppress noise and degradation of high-frequency characteristics.<br><br>The arm lifter uses a silicone oil cylinder hydraulic piston lever system.<br><br>The exterior has a castall finish.</p>
