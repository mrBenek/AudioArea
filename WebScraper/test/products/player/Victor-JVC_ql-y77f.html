				<p class="detail">A record player with an ED servo tone arm.<br><br>A microcomputer-controlled ED servo tone arm has been adopted in pursuit of zero resonance and zero vibration.<br>The ED servo tone arm is a system that electronically and contactlessly suppresses the peak of fo, which is harmful to sound quality, without using mechanical friction such as oil dump. Two pairs of coreless linear motors directly connected to the horizontal and vertical bearings of the arm detect arm vibration purely electronically and cancel the vibration by feedback control using a microcomputer.<br>In the QL-Y77F, this double direct drive ED servo tone arm has been further improved. By strictly examining the mounting position of the coreless coil and improving the bearing accuracy, the servo gain has been increased to approximately five times that of the conventional one, and stable high-speed feedback operation has been strengthened.<br>In addition, the arm operates normally even when the player is tilted because both horizontal and vertical directions are symmetrical and dynamic balance system.<br><br>A pipe replacement system is adopted to eliminate play at the head shell mounting part.<br>A tapered straight pipe with high rigidity and light mass is used for the pipe. However, the cartridge can be easily replaced by adding an optional spare pipe or universal S-shaped pipe. The optional S-shaped pipe is equipped with anti-vibration material and a chucking lock head connector to eliminate resonance. The pipe replacement method and low center of gravity TH (tracing hold) structure enable optimum tracing for various cartridges.<br>In addition, by rigidly joining the arm base and turntable base with a docking plate, the phase of each vibration is matched, and intermodulation distortion is suppressed.<br><br>Operability has been improved by gathering the control part of the tone arm in one place in the right front of the cabinet.<br>In this control section, the Q-dump adjustment of fo, needle pressure application, and anti-skating adjustment are all electronically controlled by volume, and the movement of the tone arm and operation of the full auto function are all controlled by the control section.<br><br>A double servo quartz circuit with 30 times higher quartz lock stability is used for the drive part, and a low-vibration coreless structure without cocking is used for the motor. Inertia mass is 350kg-cm with a torque of 1.8kg-cm.<sup>2</sup>A turntable weighing 2.35 kg including mat is locked in at constant speed without 1/4 rotation.<br>A quick stop with an electronic brake is also used to stop the turntable.<br><br>An elastic ring has been added to the turntable to reduce resonance.<br><br>The cabinet is made of high-density solid material with a rosewood-like mirror finish.<br>In addition, a low center of gravity type has been adopted for the insulator to raise the fulcrum position as much as possible to improve the stability of the cabinet. This insulator is height adjustable.</p>
