				<p class="detail">Quick Reverse Deck with Dolby C Type NR and multi-functional computer control design.<br><br>Equipped with a quick reverse mechanism using an infrared tape sensor, it realizes quick tape reversal.<br><br>A bi-counter capstan drive is used as the driving mechanism to ensure uniform driving characteristics in both directions.<br>In this system, dedicated capstan shafts and pinch rollers are provided for each of the forward and reverse drives, and the recording and reproducing heads are designed to be symmetrical with respect to each other to ensure uniform driving characteristics.<br>In addition, we have adopted our own high-precision tape guide to prevent tape deflection and uneven crimping at the recording / reproducing head, and moved the erasing head to the outside of the capstan for further stability.<br><br>A unique twin field super GX head has been adopted for the recording / reproducing head.<br>This head has a structure in which a recording gap and a reproducing gap are independently designed in a single head housing, thereby achieving the ideal of a head with a wide recording gap for optimum magnetic field and a narrow reproducing gap for detection of high-frequency magnetic signals.<br>In addition, the core material is made of High and High μ ferrite materials, which have excellent magnetic permeability, high saturation magnetic flux density and dynamic characteristics. These materials expand the frequency range, reduce the distortion factor and improve the linearity. They also have excellent mechanical secondary characteristics such as abrasion resistance and dust adhesion resistance.<br><br>Equipped with Dolby C Type NR as a noise reduction system.<br>The C-type has a two stage configuration with B-type circuits for both low and high levels and built-in spectral queuing and anti-frequency circuits to improve the high-frequency response and expand the saturation range and dynamic range.<br><br>Equipped with RPSS that can program the playback order of songs, you can enjoy four types of autoplay : sequential play, random play, skip play and random repeat.<br>In Sequential Play, programmed songs are played in ascending order of song number. In Random Play, programmed songs are played in the order in which they were programmed. In Skip Play, set songs can be played by skipping them.<br>With the Random Repeat function, k-brain can repeat playback up to 99 times in the specified order of sequential play, random play, or skip play.<br>With this RPSS, you can choose up to 20 songs from 99 songs.<br><br>Equipped with an intro-scan, you can play only the intro part of a song one after another for 10 seconds.<br><br>Equipped with a blank search, it is possible to find the beginning of the unrecorded part.<br>After searching for a blank part, this function creates a blank for for about 4 seconds is made and it becomes a recording standby.<br><br>Equipped with a REC cancel mechanism, the tape can be automatically rewound up to the head position recorded in error and put into a recording standby state.<br><br>A 2-motor quick &amp; quiet mechanism has been adopted for the mechanism part, and stable tape running that can withstand long-term use has been obtained.<br>The capstan drive is equipped with an electronically controlled DC-motor with high rotational accuracy, enabling low wow flutter. The reel drive is equipped with a high-torque DC-motor, enabling stable initial performance over a long period of time.<br><br>Equipped with a reverse selector, you can switch between three positions to record and play back both ways or to play continuously.<br><br>Equipped with an auto tape selector, the position of the tape to be used can be set automatically.<br><br>Equipped with an auto-mute mechanism that can automatically set 4-second intervals between songs with one touch.<br><br>It uses a sensor light control system that can check the operation status.<br><br>Equipped with LED bar meter with Max Hold function.<br><br>It is equipped with a 4-digit tape counter and an LED digital display that displays programs (2-digit) when using RPSS.<br><br>Autoplay is possible in both forward and reverse directions.<br><br>Equipped with a memory autoplay function linked to a tape counter.<br><br>Equipped with timer start mechanism, recording of absence and alarm clock playback are possible.<br><br>Equipped with an output volume that can adjust the volume of headphones.<br><br>Equipped with a monomic mechanism, it is possible to record left and right channels simultaneously with a single microphone.<br><br>There are 2 color variations of silver and pearl shadow.<br><br>Equipped with a remote control terminal, you can use a wired or wireless remote control sold separately.</p>
