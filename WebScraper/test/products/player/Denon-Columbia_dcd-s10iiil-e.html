				<p class="detail">This is a limited model CD player released to commemorate the change of the name from DENON to Denon in October 2001.<br><br>Equipped with AL24 Processing Plus, DENON&#39;s original analog waveform reproduction technology.<br>The DCD-S10IIIL uses the AL24 Processing Plus, which can operate at 192 kHz, enabling highly reliable and highly accurate arithmetic processing. This enables high-bit and high-sampling as well as reduced quantization distortion.<br>In pulse data, the passband is widened and impulse responses without ringing can be reproduced. An adaptive digital filter that automatically changes the cutoff band has been inherited to improve the reproducibility of minute levels of reverberation sound.<br><br>The DCD-S10III uses an aluminum sand mold as the base for fixing the mechanical and transformer sections. This new mold is used in the case of the transformer itself to further improve the vibration isolation effect, and the effect of vibration from the mechanical and transformer sections, which are the sources of vibration, on sound quality is reduced.<br>In addition, we have succeeded structural technologies such as the adoption of a center mechanical mount with high structural stability, a mechanical cover that reduces the effect of vibration from the drive mechanism to the circuit, an insulator made of sintered alloy with vibration absorbing material, a 15 mm thick front panel, a triple structure bottom cover and double structure top cover. This reduces the adverse effects of vibration from inside and outside.<br>The chassis is copper plated to reduce interference from high-frequency noise.<br><br>Hybrid structure S. V. H. loader is adopted for the mechanism part.<br>The tray uses a highly vibration-resistant coating containing protein, a lightweight and highly rigid aluminum die-cast shaft receiver with excellent vibration control, and a plate attached to the lower part of the tray to prevent delicate deformation of the tray, ensuring stable rotation and absorbing vibration.<br><br>The D/A converter uses a multi-24-bit D/A converter to faithfully convert 24-bit data obtained by the AL24 Processing Plus.<br>The multi-24-bit D/A converter is less susceptible to fluctuations in the power supply voltage (current). In addition, the in-band quantization distortion level is constant regardless of frequency, making it possible to reproduce with less noise.<br>Furthermore, by adopting a 4 dac configuration in which two D/A converters are used for each channel in differential operation, together with Λ S. L. C. which theoretically eliminates 0 cross distortion, the reproducibility of very small signals is improved.<br><br>It is designed to be as simple as possible so that 2-channel stereo can be played back with the best sound quality.<br>For this reason, consideration is given to obtaining a clearer output, such as omitting the headphone circuit which is the load of the output section.<br><br>It has an HDCD (High Definition Compatible Digital) decoder.<br>HDCD achieves a wide dynamic range and high resolution with encoding and coding technology that greatly reduces distortion during digital recording while maintaining compatibility with conventional CD formats.<br>By installing this HDCD decoder, it is possible to reproduce high-resolution, low-distortion and high-quality sound from HDCD-compatible discs.<br><br>Equipped with one optical and one coaxial external digital input terminal that can be used as a stand-alone D/A converter.<br>It can be used as a digital selector because it is compatible with 96kHz/24bit digital signals such as DVD, and it can output through external input.<br><br>The pickup has a simple structure that minimizes the number of parts and improves trace accuracy, reliability, and durability.<br><br>The digital and analog circuits, transformers and boards are separated to reduce the deterioration of sound quality caused by digital signals. The digital system is also compact to minimize interference with the analog system.<br><br>Equipped with a digital servo that detects and adjusts disk conditions.<br><br>The latest sound quality large machined pin jack, the latest sound quality parts are carefully selected and used.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
