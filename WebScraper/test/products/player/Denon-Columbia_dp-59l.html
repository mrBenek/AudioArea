				<p class="detail">A record player developed by putting in all DENON player technology from broadcasting station player to DP-100M.<br><br>DP-59L has an auto lift mechanism.<br>The auto-lift mechanism uses a contact-free structure that does not affect the rotational accuracy or arm sensitivity. The end of the record is detected by a unique method combining two methods : optical position detection and velocity detection using magnetic characteristics. This protects the needle tip and record.<br><br>The turntable has a diameter of 32.5 cm, a wall thickness of 7 mm and a weight of 2.2 kg.<br><br>A low center of gravity AC servo motor is used as the drive motor.<br>The shaft of this motor is given a large diameter of 10 mm and firmly supports the heavy turntable.<br><br>Bi-directional servo DENON quartz is used for the servo circuit.<br>In order to maximize the phase control of the quartz PLL circuit, the DENON quartz uses the magnetic recording detection method, which is a high-precision speed control mechanism. This method detects 1,000 magnetic pulses on the periphery of the turntable, where speed changes are most easily detected, and checks as many as 555.55 times per second (at 33 1/3 revolutions), making it the most precise mechanism for rotation control. This high-precision speed detection and phase control by crystal oscillation suppress small fluctuations in rotation speed, and at the same time, achieves rotation accuracy of 0.002% rotational speed deviation.<br>The bi-directional servo DENON quartz incorporated in the DP-59L provides quick response not only when the rotation is delayed, but also when it is too fast. This ensures that even when the rotation is changed from 45 to 33 1/3, the speed is stabilized at the specified speed. It also provides smooth braking effects for the electronic brake.<br><br>The tone arm uses a dynamic servo tracer.<br>The ultra-low frequency noise generated by the warping and eccentricity of a record is hidden in the ultra-low frequency range with the main component of about 6 Hz or less. This ultra-low frequency noise can be prevented by setting the low-frequency resonance frequency (fo : about 10 Hz) by using a light-mass arm. However, when a high-compliance cartridge is used, the cartridge body itself swings around the low-frequency resonance frequency stimulated by the warping and eccentricity of a record, and the output becomes large.<br>It is equipped with an electronic Q-dump mechanism to eliminate the increase in crosstalk and ultra-low frequency noise caused by this phenomenon, and the effects of record warping and eccentricity are eliminated by the Q-dump mechanism and light-mass arm.<br><br>Newly developed light weight straight arm is used for the arm.<br>This arm uses a light mass arm pipe with a diameter of approximately 1.3 times the diameter with improved precision of the fulcrum, drawing out the performance of a light needle pressure and high compliance cartridge.<br>The lead wires of the arm pipe are made of Litz wire, which is composed of 11 twisted oxygen-free copper wires. The cross-sectional area of the arm pipe is 3 to 4 times larger than that of the conventional one, and the internal resistance is kept low.<br><br>Equipped with a pitch control function.<br>Speed can be varied up to ± 9.9% at 0.1% pitch.<br><br>The liquid crystal display counter improves operability.<br><br>A heavy wooden cabinet with a height of 11 cm has been adopted.<br>The exterior is finished with a rose-like luster.<br><br>Large arm bases, large insulators, 7 mm thick turntables, 5 mm thick turntable sheets, etc., all types of vibration are considered.<br><br>Non-contact, purely electronic anti-skating mechanism is adopted.<br><br>Uses an integrally molded dust cover.</div>
