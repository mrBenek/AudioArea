				<p class="detail">This is a full-auto player that thoroughly pursues the ideal of picking up all the music information engraved in the sound groove from every angle.<br><br>It is equipped with Sony&#39;s original biotracer.<br>This is a system that electronically controls all operations with a microcomputer that makes several hundred logical decisions every one thousandth of a second, speed and position sensors, and linear motors. With this system, the low-frequency resonance peak can be suppressed to less than 3 dB regardless of the type of cartridge installed. At the same time, the crosstalk is also improved to realize excellent low-frequency reproduction.<br>In addition, the wow and flutter sensation is reduced, and sound quality such as rise, localization, dynamic range and distortion sensation is improved.<br><br>Linear tracking system is adopted for the arm part.<br>In order to prevent rattling at the base of the tracking arm, which is a problem with this method, we have been thoroughly eliminating resonance based on the know-how obtained in the development of the biotracer. This reduces tracking error and enables clearer music playback.<br><br>The rotary system employs a 3-stage block configuration, incorporating the most advanced technologies in the development of motor technology and control system to enable the turntable to rotate quietly and smoothly.<br>By removing the brush and slot from the DC motor, the BSL motor which fundamentally eliminated the cause of torque unevenness, the magnet-disk speed detection which quickly catches minute rotation changes by average detection signal of high-density magnetization on the turntable with the multi-gap head, and the quartz lock which performs accurate servo by utilizing high oscillation accuracy of the crystal, stable rotation characteristics are acquired.<br><br>Equipped as standard with an MC cartridge (XL-333E) with replaceable needle using an air core 8 shape coil using samarium-cobalt.<br><br>It uses an electronic needle pressure application method that allows the needle pressure to be adjusted by the volume controller on the panel even during recording performance.<br><br>Equipped with a with a queueing mechanism that can move the tone arm left and right by button operation. The movement within 5 mm left and right is designed to move slowly so that accurate head positioning is possible.<br><br>Equipped with a quick repeat mechanism in which the arm does not return to the rest position and immediately resumes playing from the head of the record board.<br><br>Equipped with an opto-electronic disc size selector that automatically selects the size regardless of whether it is 17 cm EP or 30 cm cmLP, and the tone arm accurately leads in.<br>In addition, even if the start button is pressed without setting the record needle, the needle tip does not drop and returns as it is.<br><br>Equipped with a muting mechanism that cuts the output until the needle tip comes down and eliminates noise when the needle tip touches the record board.<br><br>The cabinet is made of SBMC material with strength and sufficient internal loss, and uses a large insulator filled with highly viscoelastic material.<br><br>By using RM-65 which is sold separately, it is possible to play synchronized with Sony deck.</p>
