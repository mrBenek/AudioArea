				<p class="detail">A CD player capable of digital separation as well as high-level CD playback by the player itself.<br><br>The digital filter uses a high-density four times oversampling method.<br>Before the D/A conversion, this digital filter oversamples a digital signal with a sampling frequency of 44.1 kHz to 176.4 kHz, four times the sampling frequency, and eliminates the lower frequency limit of unwanted components close to the audio band from 24.1 kHz to 156.4 kHz. As a result, the attenuation characteristics of the low-pass filter after the D/A conversion can be made extremely smooth, group delay characteristics are greatly improved, and waveform reproducibility is improved. In addition, a filter with fewer stages and fewer elements can be realized, and sound quality degradation due to components can be suppressed.<br><br>The D/A converter is equipped with a newly developed D/A converter for the left and right channels independently.<br>This D/A converter is a high-speed type that corresponds to the signal processing speed of the digital filter. Therefore, 0 cross distortion and glitch can be ignored at small signal levels. As a result, not only the L/R switching circuit but also the sample-and-hold circuit, which had been necessary in the past, are no longer needed, greatly simplifying the audio circuit configuration after the D/A conversion.<br><br>The audio circuit has a twin mono configuration for all stages with left and right channel separation to eliminate interference between channels.<br>In addition, a third order GIC-type low-pass filter, which is extremely low-order and only allows the music signal to pass through a resistor, is adopted. Simple and straight transmission, we have achieved clear sound image localization and sound quality that does not cause distortion.<br><br>Unilinear converter system using newly developed 3rd generation LSI exclusive for CD is adopted.<br>This system performs all digital signal processing in perfect synchronization with one master clock. In principle, there is no beat generation due to clock interference, which leads to sound quality degradation. In addition, the number of peripheral parts of the LSI group composing this system has been reduced by half by increasing the integration density, contributing to improved stability and reliability of digital systems and reduced power consumption.<br><br>Equipped with a digital processing soft muting function.<br>This is a mechanism to prevent click noise from being generated when playing stops or poses are operated, and the degradation of sound quality is suppressed by digital signal processing.<br><br>The power transformer is equipped with two high-capacity transformers equivalent to the CDP 553 esd. Both digital and analog power transformers are used exclusively. This eliminates various types of interference with the analog system that can cause sound quality degradation, such as voltage drops caused by an increase in servo current and effects of harmonic components contained in digital signals.<br>In addition, analog transformers have a capacitance nearly 10 times that required, and the rectifier and smoothing circuits have been further enhanced. In addition to the use of high-speed diodes with large rectifier capacitance, high-quality electrolytic capacitors from Shinkai have a total capacitance of 44,000 μ F.<br>In addition to careful consideration of the mounting position and direction of the transformer, an ES filter is provided to prevent noise from the AC line.<br><br>The g (Gibraltar) chassis is used.<br>The G chassis is made of calcium carbonate, the main component of marble, reinforced with unsaturated polyester and glass fiber. It has sufficient mass and rigidity, high internal loss, and excellent vibration damping characteristics. Moreover, since it is non-magnetic and non-metal, the generation of electro-striction is suppressed as much as possible.<br>In addition to the shape that has been carefully examined acoustically, such as increasing rigidity by running ribs vertically and horizontally, the legs are made of a combination of non-resilient rubber and metal, and the structure is integrated with the bottom of the G chassis. This eliminates external vibrations and internal vibrations generated by the power supply unit, and eliminates noise pollution caused by unnecessary vibrations.<br><br>Based on the G chassis, the CDP 555 esd uses a double structure consisting of an external chassis made of non-magnetic aluminum drawer material and an internal chassis plated with copper to reduce magnetic strain, improving rigidity and strength.<br>In this highly rigid chassis, the mechanical block, digital and analog sections, and control system are arranged in a completely separated manner to suppress interference and resonance of each section.<br><br>The base unit that supports the optical mechanism uses a composite molded product of special ceramic containing powder and metal with extremely high internal loss. This greatly reduces resonance sharpness and simultaneously increases rigidity. In addition, the entire mechanical block is a floating structure that insulates from external vibration.<br>In addition, the chucking arm has a double structure made of resin and metal, and aerodynamic measures have been taken to prevent surface movement during disk rotation. This reduces disturbance of servo current caused by unnecessary vibration and improves sound quality.<br><br>Uses high-quality parts that have been carefully examined for audibility.<br>The printed circuit board is made of glass epoxy and treated with a resist (protective film) to prevent unnecessary capacitance.<br>The output amplifier is equipped with a high-quality sound amplifier, and the audio signal system is made of OFC wire material. In addition, we use carefully selected materials such as composite capacitors with non-inductive electrode structure and resistors with gold-plated carbon film resistor elements molded with hard resin.<br>In addition, the リニリティ is equipped with an excellent large lineout volume, and the remote control is powered by a motor to prevent deterioration of sound quality.<br><br>The S servo, a newly developed predictive control method, is used in the servo circuit.<br>The newly developed RFIC detects the position and size of dirt and dust on the disk, instantly predicts the timing of the next appearance based on the rotation cycle of the disk, and controls the servo amount of the tracking and focus feedback circuit with a microcomputer.<br>The prediction time accuracy is as high as 1/8,000 second. Moreover, it is compatible with CLV (constant linear velocity), and this accuracy is maintained at any position in the inner and outer periphery. Unlike the conventional method, the servo gain is switched just before the drop-out occurs, which greatly improves the trace stability. Moreover, the servo current is also minimized, which reduces the adverse effect on the analog circuit.<br><br>A latched digital output is used for digital output.<br>This terminal is equipped with a latch for time axis compensation just before the output to more strictly eliminate the jitter component. In addition to the use of an isolation pulse transformer, the analog output is cut during digital output and the digital output is cut during analog output to prevent mutual interference.<br>This output terminal is designed to output subcode information as well.<br><br>High-speed linear motor tracking mechanism is adopted for the mechanism part.<br>In this mechanism, a linear motor is integrated into the optical block, and the selection time from the first song to the start of the final song is less than one second. In addition, there is no transmission mechanism such as gears, and reliability and durability are greatly improved.<br><br>Equipped with a multi-centralized display with next display.<br>The display is equipped with a music calendar that directly displays track numbers of up to 20 recorded songs.<br><br>One touch direct music selection with 20 keys is possible.<br><br>It is equipped with 20 songs RMS function with memory backup, and you can reserve up to 20 songs in your favorite order by one touch selection with 20 keys and play the program. With this function, you can add or change the program while playing.<br>In addition, since it is equipped with a memory backup function, it is possible to play an alarm clock with program music using a timer sold separately.<br><br>5-mode repeat of 1 song / ALL/A-B / Program / Shuffle is available.<br>In 4 modes except for A-B partial repeat, the repeat count can be set up to 9 times.<br><br>Equipped with a shuffle play function.<br><br>Equipped with an auto pause function, you can wait in a pause state every time a piece of music is played.<br><br>It has a オーオトプセース function that automatically sets the interval between songs to 3 seconds.<br>The auto space function is always activated when the program is played back.<br><br>It is equipped with functions such as AMS function, index search and music search.<br><br>Equipped with volume-linked headphone jacks and variable / fixed output jacks.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
