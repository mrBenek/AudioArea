				<p class="detail">A jacket-sized linear tracking DD player with automatic track selection for any program up to 10 songs.<br><br>All basic operations are electronically controlled, and all operations related to record performance are electronically controlled and fully automated. This allows all operations from setting the number of revolutions to lifting and lowering the needle to be completed just by setting a record and pressing the start button.<br><br>Equipped with a 10-track program automatic selection mechanism.<br>The front of the cabinet is equipped with program buttons from 1 to 10 that automatically select up to 10 songs according to the order in which the buttons are pressed. The LED above the button lights up when the button is pressed for easy confirmation of the program.<br>During the performance, the LED indicating the number of songs is flashing to indicate which song is being played. In addition, since the number of songs in the record is automatically read, it is designed not to be programmed even if a button larger than the number of songs being edited is accidentally pressed.<br>The program can be changed freely before the start button is pressed. After the start of the program performance, if you press the stop clear button, all programs will be released and the arm will return automatically. If you press the start button without pressing the program button, the program will start from the beginning of the record.<br><br>The LED lights up when the repeat mechanism is activated, and pressing the repeat button again cancels the repeat operation.<br><br>If you want to listen to a programmed song from the beginning, for example, while the LED of the program button is lit, you can press the button again to return to the beginning of the song.<br><br>It is equipped with a search function between specified songs. During performance of a programmed song, if the arm moves forward or backward a little within the range of the sound groove of the song, the arm can be controlled forward or backward within the range of the sound groove of the specified song by moving the start button or the stop button with the quality stick.<br><br>An optical sensor is used to detect between songs of a record, and moves in synchronization with the arm, and the arm is accurately lowered to the silent groove detected by the sensor.<br><br>The arm employs a unique dynamic balance type linear tracking arm, which moves along the record plane in a straight line in the same way as a cutting machine. Therefore, the inside force, which causes tracking error and channel imbalance, which cause distortion, can be minimized.<br>The arm is driven by a DC motor with high rotational accuracy, which is electronically controlled by a microcomputer. In addition, the arm deflection angle is detected by a proprietary optical sensor that operates near the needle tip of the cartridge to control the cartridge in an ideal condition.<br><br>It adopts a unique dynamic balance system in which the center of gravity matches the center of the arm rotation axis, and it realizes always stable tracing performance without strict horizontal adjustment or needle pressure adjustment.<br>In addition, the arm lifting mechanism combined with a precision gear realizes smooth operation, and the built-in muting mechanism eliminates noise that occurs when the needle tip touches or leaves the record surface.<br><br>The arm bearing has a high-sensitivity gimbal suspension structure with 4-point support system using pivot and ball bearing, and high initial motion sensitivity is obtained in both horizontal and vertical directions. In addition, the arm has a low-mass design with an effective mass of 9g including the cartridge, and achieves stable sound-groove follow-up performance against the sleigh and understory of a record.<br><br>The MM type cartridge uses a multilayer laminated core with low high-frequency attenuation for all of the magnetic circuit. In addition to improving the performance of the power generation system, Technics technology reduces the performance of the vibration system, enabling wide-band reproduction.<br><br>The cartridge uses an easy-to-replace plug-in connector system and does not require needle pressure setting.<br>In addition, mounting accuracy has been improved and optimum matching between the cartridge and tone arm has been achieved.<br><br>In the drive system, we have adopted a unique integrated structure DD in which the rotor of the motor is integrated with the turntable, and we pursue mechanical accuracy including the turntable.<br>The motor employs a two phase full-wave drive type flat-faced slotless motor that improves the S / N ratio and reduces wow flutter. This eliminates performance degradation due to variations in characteristics of the Hall element for position detection and improves rotational accuracy.<br>In addition, a unique all-around detection FG is adopted for the rotational speed detection part to obtain a more advanced detection signal.<br><br>The cabinet&#39;s top, bottom, and bottom base are all made of TNRC (Technics Non-Resonance Compound), a unique acoustic material with excellent vibration absorption, combined with a compact structure that is less susceptible to sound pressure, to improve vibration and resonance resistance.<br><br>The 45 rpm adapter is integrated around the spindle of the turntable.<br><br>Synchronized recording is possible when used with the separately sold jacket size deck RS-7.</p>
