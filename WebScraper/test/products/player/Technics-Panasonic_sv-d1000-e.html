				<p class="detail">The first DAT deck of Technics was developed by bringing together Matsushita&#39;s comprehensive strengths, including Technics audio technology.<br><br>The deck section utilizes Matsushita&#39;s VTR technology. The head uses an original amorphous head with an amorphous layer deposited around the gap. In addition, in order to ensure the perfect assembly accuracy of the rotary head, a precision die-cast cylinder base is adopted to drive the machining accuracy, and the lead of the lower cylinder, which serves as a guide for the tape load, also pursues micron-order accuracy. Thus, excellent running performance is obtained.<br>In addition, the capstan, cylinder and reel rotations are controlled by a powerful servo system to trace the rotary head accurately to a fine track width.<br><br>Equipped with a tension regulator based on the know-how obtained in video production, the tape tension is kept constant regardless of the remaining amount of the tape.<br><br>The A/D and D/A conversion sections employ a dual system in which the left and right sides are independent to solve the phase difference problem.<br>Also, the DA converter output is operated in current mode to improve the speed of D/A conversion.<br><br>Class AA is mounted on the sample-and-hold circuit for recording and reproduction systems and the output stage buffer amplifier.<br>The class AA circuit is a circuit unique to Technics in which a voltage control amplifier and a current drive amplifier are separated. The sample-and-hold circuit is originally a circuit with a large load capacity, but by operating the voltage control amplifier in a no-load state, accuracy of D/A and A/D conversion can be pursued, and low distortion and high S / N ratio are realized.<br>In addition, by mounting a class AA circuit in the output stage buffer amplifier, pure transmission is possible without being affected by the input impedance of the connected preamplifier or the capacitance load of the cable.<br><br>In order to remove unnecessary frequencies when over-sampling, it is equipped with a unique super-clean digital filter that combines a 96th order digital filter with increased calculation speed and a GIC type analog low-pass filter.<br>As a result, we have obtained a sharp cutoff characteristic that does not generate components outside the audio band and unnecessary radiation that tend to occur during high-order oversampling.<br><br>The power supply section is equipped with a unique active servo power supply. By forming a feedback circuit by combining a constant voltage IC with excellent temperature characteristics and a broadband IC with excellent high-frequency characteristics, excellent regulation is achieved and AC noise components are not affected by the power supply.<br>In addition to the large-capacity OFC transformer, an electrolytic capacitor of 36,000 μ F is mounted.<br><br>By using a toroidal pulse transformer for digital input / output terminals, coaxial cable terminals for electrical isolation between connected devices are mounted, and optical cable terminals are also mounted.<br><br>A computer-simulated earthquake-resistant structure cabinet is used, and 3 mm thick steel plate is used for the top plate.<br><br>Equipped with wide-scale DDR level meter that supports DAT.<br>This meter uses a dedicated LSI to convert digital data into a 32-segment bar graph, enabling high-precision level display. It has a minimum response sensitivity of -60dB and an auto-reset peak-hold function that reliably displays the peak level of a single sample (approximately 1 / 50000th of a second).<br><br>High-speed search is possible by reading the address data recorded in the subcode.<br>In this system, the rotation speed of the rotary head for FF search and REW search is changed from that for normal playback in order to ensure accurate reading. However, the SV-D1000 is equipped with a unique CRV (Constant Relative Velocity) digital servo system that keeps the early withdrawal speed of the tape and head constant regardless of the state, enabling 200 x speed search.<br><br>In addition to manually recording the program number, it is equipped with an auto program number function that constantly monitors the volume during recording and automatically records the music number at the beginning of the next track when there is no sound for more than two seconds.<br>In addition, the operating sensitivity can be selected from two levels of - 60 dB and - 40 dB according to the recording source.<br><br>It is equipped with random programs of up to 99 songs and repeat playback of one song / all songs / program / specified range (A-B).<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.<br><br>You cannot copy digital copies from a CD player or from a source containing copy guards.</p>
