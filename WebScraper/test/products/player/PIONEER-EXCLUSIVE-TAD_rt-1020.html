				<p class="detail">This is a tape deck with a design that is suitable for professional in every corner, and pursues excellent long-term stability and high quality.<br><br>There were 2 kinds of variations depending on the speed specification.<br>The RT-1020 is a standard speed machine of 19 ~ 9.5cm/s. It can record and reproduce twice as much as the No. 7 standard reel by using the No. 10 large reel. In addition, the RT-1020H is a pro-speed machine of 38cm/s ~ 19cm/s. It can record ultra-Hi-Fi by high-speed while maintaining economical efficiency and high functions of the 4-track format and compatibility with commercially available music tapes.<br><br>The inside is a single chassis with a thickness of 5 mm to reduce the plane accuracy of the reference plane, and the motor, head, guide, capstan, etc. are firmly fixed to the die-cast frame. This prevents deviation in dimensional accuracy and parallelism between parts, and improves stability and reliability to withstand the use of large No. 10 reel.<br>In addition, the mechanical parts are laid out as a unit by block to ensure high maintainability.<br><br>A 4-pole / 8-pole 2-speed hysteresis synchronous motor and a 100 mm φ large flywheel are used to drive the capstan, and a 6 mm φ straight shaft with less than 0.2 μ of roundness is used for the capstan.<br>The reel drive is equipped with a special 6-pole inner rotor induction motor from Shinkai that combines eddy current type characteristics with induction type large starting torque with low heat generation. This motor has a small rotor inertia and the synergistic effect of a differential-type band brake with a solenoid prevents excessive force from being applied to the tape.<br>In addition, for back tension and take-up tension, it is equipped with a switch that can adjust the torque of the reel motor according to the size of No. 10 and No. 7 and the reel size, and it prevents drop-out by always maintaining a constant tension.<br><br>For the first time in this class, a highly stable differential band brake has been adopted for the brake mechanism. This ensures a reliable braking effect and reduces the load on the tape.<br><br>Stainless steel rollers with precision bearings are used for the tape guide part to make tape travel more stable and reduce flutter at the end of the tape.<br><br>The head part uses a 3-head system.<br>The playhead uses a hyperbolic Permalloy head with excellent in-line characteristics and good tape-touch, enabling four track two channel playback as well as discrete four channel playback.<br>The recording head is a 4-track, 2-channel head, and is a hyperbolic type as is the case with the reproducing head.<br><br>The operation buttons are purely electronic and are simple and highly reliable by avoiding the use of micro switches and relays.<br>In addition, since it is a direct change type, the PLAY operation can be performed from the REW (FF) state without going through the STOP button. In addition, it has a built-in tape protection system that automatically starts after the tape stops even when No. 10 tape is used.<br>It is operated by solenoid (plunger) control. However, since it is a mechanical lock type, preset is possible even when the power supply is OFF. By combining this with a commercially available timer, it is possible to record an absence or play an alarm.<br><br>A 3-stage direct connection system using low-noise silicon transistors is adopted for the reproduction amplifier section, and four channels are built in.<br>The recording amplifier has a high S/N ratio and s / N and wide dynamic range. In particular, the Mic amplifier is designed to be able to use a 600 Ω professional low-impedance microphone as it is.<br>In addition, an independent equalizer circuit provides an accurate curve, and the use of an electronic FET-based switch on the playback side improves reliability by replacing conventional electrical switches with contacts.<br>In addition, it uses a bias OFF delay circuit that turns off the signal circuit of the head after the bias current disappears when the recording state is OFF. This prevents the head from being magnetized and prevents click noise from being recorded on the tape.<br>In addition, it is equipped with IC meter, headphone circuit, buffer amplifier, constant voltage power supply circuit, etc.<br><br>Equipped with a tape selector with 3 levels of bias and 2 levels of equalizer, it is compatible with commercially available tape manufacturers.<br><br>Equipped with a large level meter.<br>Also, LED is used for the recording indicator.<br><br>The built-in sound-on-sound feature allows you to record an R track while mixing the L track playback with the microphone input. You can also use an external connection to perform line recording while feeding back part of the output signal of the playhead to the recording head for an echo effect.<br><br>In FF/REW mode, the tape lifter is interlocked to separate the tape from the head.<br>In the RT-1020/RT-1020H, because the lifter movement is small, CUE monitoring is also possible by increasing the playback level with guided playback.<br><br>It is also possible to follow up recording to the recording state while running the tape in the regenerating condition.<br><br>4-track monaural recording is possible.<br><br>The tape monitor switch uses an L/R independent lever switch type.<br><br>Equipped with 4-channel to 2-channel changeover switch, 4-channel stereo FRONT / REAR meter display changeover switch.<br><br>Setting the recording mode switch to OFF prevents erroneous recording.<br><br>The pose uses a lever system that can be locked.<br><br>Mixing input of MIC and LINE input is possible.<br><br>The RT-1020H has a playback level control that can adjust the output level.<br>This function is divided into front and rear and can be adjusted independently for 4-channel playback.<br><br>Uses a one touch removable reel clamper.<br><br>The 4-channel playback level control can be fine-tuned with a semi-fixed level control at the bottom of the chassis.<br><br>There was a carrying case kit sold separately.</p>
