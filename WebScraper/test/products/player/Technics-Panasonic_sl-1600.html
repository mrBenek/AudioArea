				<p class="detail">The newly developed B / FG system one chip IC improves operability and stability.<br><br>It is equipped with AN630 which is a one chip IC of B ・ FG (Back Electromotive Force Frequency Generator) method developed for the first time in the world.<br>The one chip IC (AN630) adopted for SL 1600 is 3x2.7 mm.<sup>2</sup>A total of 321 elements, including transistors, diodes, resistors, and capacitors, are contained on a silicon substrate. It is one of the world&#39;s most integrated bipolar linear ICs at that time.<br>As a result, the motor drive unit, control unit and various additional functions are integrated into a one chip IC, and the B / FG system is constructed using the back electromotive force frequency of the motor drive winding. This improves temperature characteristics, drift characteristics and transient characteristics, and improves the reliability of the player system.<br><br>The auto mechanism of SL-1300 is incorporated into the auto mechanism.<br>Precision molding resin is used for the drive part of the automatic mechanism to reduce the operating noise of the mechanism that is a concern in automatic players and to reduce the load on the turntable drive system.<br>Combined with the adoption of a high-sensitivity gimbal suspension tone arm, it is also compatible with light needle pressure cartridges.<br><br>The tone arm section is equipped with a universal tone arm of gimbal suspension system.<br>An initial motion sensitivity of 7 mg has been achieved by a gimbal suspension type bearing structure that uses precision pivot bearings for the horizontal and vertical bearings of the tone arm.<br>In addition, the base of the tone arm has an integrated structure using zinc alloy die-cast, which has a particularly high specific gravity, to provide sufficient strength and weight to eliminate unnecessary vibration.<br><br>The cartridge is equipped with Technics MM cartridge EPC-270C.<br>By directly connecting the CKS magnet with excellent magnetic characteristics and the high-strength aluminum alloy pipe cantilever with high rigidity, the effective mass of the vibrator is reduced, the mechanical impedance is reduced, and various characteristics are improved.<br><br>The motor has a structure that combines the rotor and turntable of the motor.<br>The motor uses an ultra-low-speed brushless DC motor to reduce power consumption and vibration caused by excess energy and heat generation.<br><br>The turntable is equipped with a newly designed turntable sheet with improved adhesion to the record surface.<br>In addition, by lightly pressing the turntable sheet, the 17 cm record can be easily removed.<br><br>The cabinet has a structure in which a turntable and a tone arm are fixed to a base with a main base and integrating a main base and a bottom cover. Furthermore, the entire base is floated from the main player case by an insulator composed of an appropriate viscoelastic material and a metal spring. In addition, Technics&#39;s unique double insulator with newly developed high-mass design is adopted with an emphasis on acoustic characteristics.<br>As a result, a synergistic effect is obtained by the two insulators, and excellent vibration isolation and absorption characteristics are realized against the direct sound pressure of the speaker, external vibration such as the floor, and partial resonance caused by these, thereby improving the howling prevention effect.<br><br>It is equipped with a memory repeat function that allows repeated playing from 1 to 6 times and repeated playing continuously.<br>In addition, manual performance, auto-start and Oatley turn are possible.<br><br>Equipped with a prism-type strobe illuminator that also serves as a pilot lamp.<br><br>Equipped with an anti-skating control to easily obtain an appropriate outside force.<br>An appropriate outside force can be applied simply by adjusting the knob to the same value as the needle pressure value.<br><br>In order to prevent damage to the needle tip and records that are likely to occur when the tone arm is operated, a queuing device dumped with viscous oil is installed.<br>Since the tone arm can be raised and lowered by the lever operation, it is convenient for the beginning and temporary suspension of musical performance.<br><br>The shell is made of solid die-cast aluminum to prevent harmful shell resonance, while the shell terminal is gold-plated to reduce the contact resistance of the shell.<br><br>Uses a low-capacity PU output cord that does not degrade the high-frequency performance of the cartridge.</p>
