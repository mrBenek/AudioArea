				<p class="detail">A 3-head stereo cassette deck that supports metal tapes.<br><br>It is equipped with fine bias tuning in order to bring out the ability of any tape.<br>The correction bias value can be set by matching the two signal levels of a 400 Hz and 10 kHz double-signal oscillator to make the frequency characteristics flat.<br><br>Equipped with Dolby Rec calibration, the sensitivity of the tape being used is controlled to perfectly match the standard input / output characteristics of the deck, enabling accurate Dolby recording.<br><br>An OSC circuit is mounted for accurate tuning.<br>The built-in oscillator for the BIAS / ADJ/REC / CAL is composed of an operational amplifier with good stability, and the output level characteristics are not affected by external factors such as temperature.<br>A Schmidt circuit with a high-precision level detection IC turns on the LED.<br><br>It is equipped with an auto back tension system that detects the change in tension when the tape runs and automatically controls the amount of back tension according to the degree of the change. A constant tension is applied for a long period of time from the beginning to the end of tape winding.<br>In addition, a high-precision reel with a roundness of 0.03 mm is used for the reel stand on the tape supply side to suppress instantaneous level fluctuations.<br><br>Equipped with a 3-head system in which recording and playback are independent from the head to the amplifier.<br>As a result, not only the sound of the recording source but also the sound of the recorded tape can be monitored and compared during recording.<br>The recording head is 5 μ m and the reproducing head is 1 μ m. By setting the gap length suitable for each characteristic, various characteristics such as wide-band and flat frequency characteristics, low distortion rate, and expansion of high-frequency dynamic range are improved.<br>Ferrite head is used for both recording, playback and erasing.<br><br>In order to protect the head from vibration, damper materials of different materials are placed around the motor to prevent vibration.<br>First, a polyacetal resin flange is fixed to the motor, and the front and back of the motor are held down with natural rubber and silicon rubber. A new vibration isolation structure is adopted. The ring damper absorbs the rotational vibration of the motor itself and vibration generated from the casing of the motor.<br>Noise caused by the cocking of the DC motor which modulated the signal wave is suppressed and not transmitted to the head.<br><br>It uses an independent switching system of 3 stages of bias and 3 stages of equalizer, and demonstrates the ability of various tapes from metal tapes to normal tapes.<br><br>The reproduction equalizer amplifier uses a ± 2 power supply drive circuit with a high conductance FET as input and a current mirror circuit as load. The coupling capacitor at the output end of the head can be removed, improving the phase characteristics and realizing a high SN ratio and low distortion factor.<br>In addition, the recording equalizer amplifier uses a FET differential circuit with pure complimentary service configuration in the output-stage to drive the recording head at constant current. In the recording equalizer section, dedicated peaking coils and dedicated recording compensation circuits are installed in the Metal, Normal and Chrome positions to flatten the frequency characteristics.<br><br>It is equipped with a versatile memory index. When the tape counter is set to &quot;000&quot; at the start of Play or Rec, and when the memory switch is turned ON and the tape is rewound, the tape stops at the start position. This is a convenient function for starting a song.<br><br>Equipped with a turmer standby function that can be used for recording your absence or playing an alarm clock.<br><br>It has an output volume that can be adjusted with other sources such as tuners and players. The volume of the headphones can also be adjusted with the Phono connector.<br><br>You can set up separate recording volumes for the line and microphone, and record according to the music of the Iori, tuner or player.<br><br>It is equipped with a level meter that uses a pure electronic fluorescent tube display, whose response speed is much faster than that of a pointer type meter.<br><br>It uses a double Dolby system in which the Dolby circuit for recording and the Dolby circuit for reproduction are independent.<br>In addition, an independent 2-stage switching MPX filter is built-in. If the Dolby is turned ON and the MPX filter is turned ON during FM air check, malfunction of the Dolby NR due to pilot signal can be prevented.<br>For recording from records, etc., Dolby is ON and MPX filter is OFF position.</p>
