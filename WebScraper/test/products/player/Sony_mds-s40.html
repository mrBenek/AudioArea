				<p class="detail">This 280 mm wide MD deck is equipped with various functions and is compatible with MD-PC link.<br><br>Wide Bit Stream Technology has been introduced to enable recording and playback with a wide dynamic range by increasing the dynamic range of the ATRAC DSP and the audio data word length of peripheral circuits such as digital in / out from the previous 16 bits to more bits.<br><br>The 4.5 generation ATRAC DSP employs a new adaptive high-frequency control technology to improve high-frequency reproducibility and natural sound spread. For example, in response to an input signal, if the quantization bit number of quantization bits is small, the high-frequency range is limited and the number of quantization bits is increased for signals that feel distortion is worse. In response to signals containing complex frequency components that are less affected by insufficient quantization bits, the reproduction band is extended to higher frequencies to improve high-frequency reproducibility.<br>This adaptive high-frequency control technology combined with the expansion of the operation word length in the wide bit stream has improved the precision of signal processing, and the total harmonic distortion rate has been improved by approximately 8 dB compared to conventional methods.<br><br>It is equipped with a sampling rate converter that automatically converts 32 kHz and 48 kHz sampling frequency to 44.1 kHz.<br><br>Equipped with digital REC level control, the gain can be controlled from - ∞ dB to + 12 dB at the center of gain 0 dB.<br>It also has a built-in memory function that can store the set recording level for each input channel.<br><br>It is equipped with a music sync function. Simply by pressing the music sync button on the remote control and then starting performance on the connected device, it senses the input of a music signal and automatically starts recording.<br><br>It is equipped with a time machine recording function, and if you press the multi-jog dial in the recording pause state, you can record up to 6 seconds before the sound on the disc.<br><br>It is equipped with a monaural recording and playback function that allows you to use the MD twice as long as the display.<br><br>You can DIVIDE, COMBINE, and MOVE songs, and it also has an UNDO function to cancel the last edit operation if you make a mistake.<br><br>It is equipped with a rehearse function that allows you to check edit points in COORDINATE or DIVIDE.<br>To move edit points, you can fine-tune the DIVIDE edit point in minutes, seconds, or frames (approximately 0.01 seconds).<br><br>Equipped with an A-B ERASE function that allows you to erase between two specified points in a song.<br><br>It is equipped with a title function that can record up to 1,700 characters of disc names and song titles on the disc.<br>In addition to alphabets, numbers and symbols, katakana characters are also supported. You can input characters from the FOMA phone or remote controller during recording or playback.<br><br>It is compatible with MD-PC Link and can be connected to a PC by MD-PC Link Kit (sold separately).<br>This allows you to perform various disc editing operations from your PC, including basic operations on the MD deck, on the PC screen. You can also feel and enter hiragana characters from your PC keyboard (only on display-compatible models).<br>In addition, you can enjoy creating MD labels and recording from PCCD to MD.<br><br>The SCMS (Serial Copy Management System) allows digital recording only for one generation and does not allow digital recording for the second or later generations. However, some programs from CS broadcasting cannot be recorded.<br><br>It is equipped with a beep function which can confirm the contents of button / remote control operation by sound.<br><br>It is an energy-saving design that realizes a standby power of 1W or less.<br><br>There are 2 color variations, silver and black.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
