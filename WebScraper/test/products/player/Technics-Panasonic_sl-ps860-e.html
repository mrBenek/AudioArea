				<p class="detail">S-Advanced Mash Class A CD player with high-quality sound technology such as DAC and virtual battery operation.<br><br>The D/A conversion A DAC is used for the D/A conversion part. Mash<br>This circuit is composed of three LSIs, S-Advanced Mash and two Class A PWM output ICs, which were used in high-end models. The conventional Advanced Mash is upgraded by incorporating a fourth order noise-shaping circuit and digital de-emphasis circuit. The three chip LSI separates the Mash LSI from the PWM output ICs of the L and R channels to avoid the influence of digital noise and reduce the stroke between channels.<br>In addition, by changing the PWM output section from conventional C-MOS to bipolar and reducing the occurrence of through current due to the sharp change of current at the point of change of pulse waveform, the occurrence of overshoot and undershoot on PWM waveform is suppressed. This stabilizes the peak value of pulse and realizes ideal PWM output.<br>In addition, clock jitter is reduced by placing the crystal oscillator close to the D/A converter.<br><br>The power supply section uses a virtual battery operation circuit.<br>In this circuit, an FET element is incorporated into the power supply circuit, so that noise from the AC power supply and noise from the reference power supply that enters the audio circuit is cut off at the capacitor charge side to prevent noise from entering the audio signal.<br><br>It is equipped with digital servo and realizes stable drive by adjusting the servo amount according to the condition of each disk.<br><br>A silent mechanism is adopted, the disk tray is widened to 140 mm, the mechanism is placed in the center with a good weight balance, and TNRC with multi-layer structure of metal and BMC is adopted to reduce vibration from the outside.<br><br>The loading mechanism uses SL1, which is superior in quietness. Sound clarity is ensured by suppressing mechanical resonance. In addition, silent operation is realized by adopting a unique swing arm drive system.<br><br>Class AA circuit is used for the line-out circuit to realize an ideal class A operation.<br><br>Both internal and external vibrations are reduced by the combination of THCB (Technics Hybrid Construction Base), which has acquired excellent vibration damping characteristics by combining steel plate and viscoelastic body, and four large insulators.<br>In addition, the optical deck mechanism is placed in the center with a good weight balance, and floating with a double insulator to suppress the vibration of the mechanism.<br><br>Equipped with digital optical terminal.<br><br>Equipped with a display mode function, the display can be turned off.<br><br>A gold-plated line output terminal is mounted.<br><br>It is equipped with a synchro edit function, and by combining it with a cassette deck with a dedicated terminal of Technics / Panasonic, editing and recording can be performed in conjunction with the deck.<br><br>Equipped with a peak search function.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
