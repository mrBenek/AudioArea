				<p class="detail">DD full auto player with condensed functions in LP jacket size of 31.5 cm in length and width.<br><br>A unique dynamic balance type linear tracking arm is linear tracking arm.<br>In the linear tracking method, since the tone arm moves the record board in a straight line like the cutting machine, tracking error, which causes distortion, and inside force, which causes imbalance between channels, can be made very close to 0.<br>The SL-5 uses a unique linear tracking system with a tone arm mounted in the upper cabinet.<br><br>The arm runs using a DC motor with high rotational accuracy and excellent response, and this motor is electronically controlled by a microcomputer. In addition, in order to improve the running accuracy, a unique optical sensor (optical non-contact detection) is used to detect the arm deflection angle near the tip of the needle of the cartridge. Unlike the detection at the bearing section, it can obtain a high-precision detection signal, and the tracking groove tracking ability of the cartridge can be controlled in an ideal state. This realizes excellent performance with a tracking error angle within ± 0.1 ° and an inside force of almost 0.<br>In addition, the arm travel path is a slide bearing with a small friction coefficient to realize high-precision arm travel without unnecessary vibration caused by ball bearings and rollers.<br><br>It uses a unique dynamic balance system in which the center of gravity matches the center of the arm rotation axis, and achieves stable tracing performance without strict horizontal adjustment or needle pressure adjustment.<br><br>The arm bearing section has a 4-point support type gimbal suspension structure with pivot and ball bearing, and high initial motion sensitivity is obtained both horizontally and vertically.<br>In addition, the arm has a low-mass design with an effective mass of 9g including the cartridge, and achieves a stable sound-groove follow-up performance against sleds and underlays of records.<br><br>The MM type cartridge uses a multilayer laminated core with low high-frequency attenuation for all magnetic circuits.<br>In addition to the high performance of the power generation system, the high performance of the vibration system using Technics technology has realized wide-band reproduction.<br><br>A plug-in connector system is used to connect the arm and cartridge.<br>With this system, the needle tip can be fixed at the optimum position by simply attaching it, and an appropriate needle pressure can be obtained. Moreover, the resonance frequency is set to the optimum 12 Hz, making it possible to play records that demonstrate the performance of the cartridge.<br><br>The drive part adopts a unique integrated structure D. D. in which the rotor of the motor is integrated with the turntable, and mechanical accuracy is pursued including the turntable.<br>In addition, we have adopted a flat-faced slotless DC motor with current-controlled full-wave drive system that can improve the S / N ratio and reduce wow and flutter. This system does not cause performance degradation due to the characteristic variation of the Hall element for position detection, and improves rotation accuracy. In addition, in order to prevent torque efficiency degradation due to the slotless system, we have adopted a high-efficiency design that employs a unique coil structure with two layers of coils.<br>In addition, a unique all-around detection FG is used to detect the number of revolutions, providing a more accurate detection signal than the single-point detection method.<br><br>The upper and lower cabinets and bottom base are all made of TNRC (Technics Non-Resonance Compound), a unique acoustic material with excellent vibration absorption. Combined with the compact body which is hard to receive sound pressure, vibration resistance and resonance resistance are improved.<br><br>It uses an electronically controlled full auto mechanism that integrates all operations into four keys.<br>You only have to press the Start key to start playing, the record size and number of revolutions are automatically set according to the size, the arm returns to the rest when you press the Stop key while playing, the turntable stops rotating, and the arm automatically returns to the rest when you open the upper cabinet.<br>You can freely move the arm forward and backward by holding down the start and stop keys, and up/down of the arm is controlled by the queuing keys.<br><br>With the built-in repeat key, you can play repeatedly.<br><br>It is designed not to work when the cabinet is open or there is no record.</p>
