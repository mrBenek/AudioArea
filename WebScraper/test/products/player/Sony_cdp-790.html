				<p class="detail">A CD player with 8 x over-sampling 18-bit D/A conversion for high sound quality while equipped with rich functions.<br><br>The digital filter is an 8-times over-sampling 18-bit digital filter with Sony&#39;s unique noise-shaping technology, and the D/A converter is an 18-bit linear D/A converter that takes advantage of the high-resolution 18-bit output of the digital filter to perform D/A conversion.<br><br>A direct digital sink is used to prevent phase disturbance caused by jitter.<br>In the CDP 790, a digital sync IC connected to the D/A converter readjusts the voltage time axis of the digital signal to the accuracy of the master clock, which is free from jitter, and sends it to the D/A converter, enabling more faithful D/A conversion with accurate phase.<br><br>The digital circuit is equipped with the next-generation LSI CXD-2500, the fourth generation.<br>In the CXD 2500, the RAM capacity has been increased to 32 kbit from the conventional external configuration. Moreover, it is integrated into a single chip. This enables digital data exchange inside the LSI, greatly reducing unnecessary radiation noise, reducing interference with audio circuits, and improving error correction capability.<br><br>A newly developed pickup with a built-in RF amplifier is used in the pickup section, enabling low-impedance signal output and improving sound quality through low-noise and high-stability.<br><br>The servo circuit is equipped with S Servo III.<br>The S Servo II prevents the disturbance of the servo current from adversely affecting the analog section through the power supply. Noise components that adversely affect the analog section are removed with a low-pass filter to supply a smooth servo current. In addition, the power supply from the weak power supply section is stabilized to reduce the influence on the audio circuit.<br><br>Aluminum panel is used for the front panel.<br><br>Equipped with a custom edit function, you can perform seven functions : peak search, multi-disc program, time edit, program edit, time fade, variable fade and manual fader.<br><br>With the Peak Search function, you can perform a high-speed search of all songs and play them repeatedly for about 4 seconds before and after the point where the volume level is the highest.<br><br>The multi-disk program feature allows you to edit tapes across multiple disks.<br>Insert a disc and press the multi-program button to display Disc-1. Program the song you want to insert, eject it, insert the second disc, and program the song you want to insert.<br>This function can be programmed up to 24 songs and up to 6 discs.<br><br>With the Time Edit function, you can use the Time Set button or the Direct Key to set the length of one side of the tape. When you press the Edit button, the program is performed for side A starting with the first track. If you encounter a time-over track, the program automatically sets the longest track among the tracks that fit within the time. When you press the Edit button again, the program is performed for side B.<br>You can also program the songs you want to include first and then time-edit the remaining time.<br><br>With the Program Edit function, you can program your favorite songs in any order while checking the accumulated time using the direct keys or AMS keys. When you press the pause button, the A side is completed, and then the B side is completed at once.<br><br>With the time fade function, if you enter the length of the tape, it fades out at the specified time.<br><br>The Variable Fade function allows you to change the fade-in / fade-out operation time in units of one second from 2 seconds to 10 seconds.<br><br>With the manual faders, you can fade in / out at the desired location.<br><br>It is equipped with a delete shuffle function corresponding to 99 songs that you can leave only your favorite songs and play them randomly.<br><br>The display section has a 20-track music calendar.<br><br>It has a program performance function of up to 24 songs.<br><br>Equipped with 6-mode repeat function of 1 song / all songs / part (remote control only) / program / shuffle / delete shuffle.<br><br>It is equipped with an autospace function that adjusts the interval between songs to 3 seconds and can be operated only from a remote control.<br><br>It is equipped with index search and can be operated only from remote control.<br><br>Equipped with 2-speed music search for fast forward / fast backward while listening to music.<br>Slow mode can only be operated from the remote control.<br><br>It is equipped with two line outputs, fixed and variable. It is also equipped with a headphone port with volume linked to the lineout.<br>The volume is designed so that the LED flashes when the remote control is operated.<br><br>Equipped with an optical digital output.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
