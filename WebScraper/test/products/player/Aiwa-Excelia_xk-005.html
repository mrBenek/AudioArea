				<p class="detail">This is a stereo cassette deck that uses AMTS and PC-OCC winding, inheriting the technology of advanced machines.<br><br>Equipped with an AMTS (Amti Modulation Tape Stabilizer) to reduce vibration of the cassette half.<br>In the AMTS, the cassette box is made of a two layer structure consisting of a non-magnetic aluminum plate and a non-resilient special rubber that has been thoroughly examined in terms of sound quality. The half body of the cassette box is accurately and securely clamped at a pressure of approximately 1 kg, greatly reducing modulation noise and tape running noise.<br><br>By eliminating as much as possible the routing of electronic switches, switching circuits, connectors, and print patterns that cause poor sound quality, we aim to achieve simple and straight signal transmission.<br>In addition, it is equipped with a transmission mechanism that does not cause sound quality degradation when the MPX circuit with through position is turned off.<br><br>Equipped with super-stabilized tension dual capstan mechanism.<br>In this mechanism, two capstan units maintain a constant tape tension from the beginning to the end of winding. In addition, the capstan on the take-up side uses Aiwa&#39;s unique micro-grain processing technology to process the surface of the capstan into fine grains to prevent tape slippage and reduce deterioration of the tape and capstan itself.<br><br>High-hardness Permalloy is used for the recording and reproducing heads, and PC-OCC is used for the winding material.<br>As it is a 3-head system, it is possible to set the optimum head gap for each of wide gap for recording and narrow gap for reproduction, and sound quality such as high-frequency characteristics and MOL characteristics is improved.<br>The erasing head is made of Sendust which has no self-demagnetization effect by stopping ferrite which is normally used. This eliminates the high-frequency drop caused by self-demagnetization.<br><br>The head block is heavy weight to reduce vibration. In addition, a unique bias shield is used to prevent bias leakage from the recording head wire to the reproducing head wire and signal leakage. The head wire is completely separated into the recording and reproducing sections, preventing interference from each section.<br><br>As a noise reduction system, each Dolby B/C type is equipped with dual.<br>Equipped with dedicated Dolby NR circuits for recording and playback, simultaneous recording and playback monitoring is also possible.<br><br>Equipped with a discrete Dolby HX Pro that improves the dynamic range and frequency characteristics of the high-frequency range.<br>Dolby The HX Pro can improve the high-frequency dynamic range and f-characteristic by varying the bias amount according to the high-frequency signal amount. In addition, by using a discrete configuration instead of using an IC for the HX Pro, the optimum circuit constant can be selected according to the characteristics of the head, further improving sound quality.<br>The Dolby HX Pro works only when recording, so it also works well when played on a non-loaded cassette deck.<br><br>By direct connection between the playhead and the playback amplifier eliminates coupling capacitors, which degrade sound quality, and peaking capacitors, which cause phase shifts in the high-frequency range.<br>The amplifier uses a low-noise, low-distortion, high-slew rate dual-op amplifier developed especially for regenerative equalizers. The combination of ± 2 power supply and high-precision equalizer elements expands the dynamic range and enhances sound quality.<br><br>Equipped with manual calibration, bias and recording sensitivity can be adjusted while switching between monitor and source.<br><br>Equipped with a 4-digit digital counter with memory.<br><br>Equipped with MPX filter with through position.<br><br>The DC configuration of the reproduction amplifier section is ± 2 power supply.<br><br>An electrolytic capacitor for audio is used.<br><br>Low output impedance power source is adopted.<br><br>Equipped with an auto tape selector, it detects the type of tape and automatically sets the playback equalizer, recording equalizer and bias suitable for each tape.<br><br>The headphone jack uses a gold-plated terminal.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
