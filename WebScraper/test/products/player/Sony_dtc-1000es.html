				<p class="detail">Sony&#39;s DAT Deck 1.<br><br>The basic DAT format uses a standard mode with a sampling frequency of 48 kHz and 16-bit linear quantization to ensure a frequency response of 2 Hz to 22 kHz ± 0.5 dB and a dynamic range of 90 dB or more.<br>In addition to the standard mode, it is equipped with a playback-only mode with a sampling frequency of 44.1 kHz and a recording / playback mode with a sampling frequency of 32 kHz. DTC-1000ES does not allow digital recording of containing copy-protected codes.<br><br>Like 8 mm video, DAT uses a helical scan method in which signals are recorded obliquely to the longitudinal direction of the tape.<br>The head drum rotates at the same time as the tape runs. Although the tape speed is low at 8.15mm/s, the relative speed is about 3m/s. This allows for a compact size while storing 2.2 Gbytes of information in one roll of tape.<br><br>The error correction method employs the double-encoded Reed-Solomon method, which enables powerful correction and correction by thoroughly analyzing random and burst errors that can occur in the tape / head system.<br>In this system, a Reed-Solomon code with more improved performance than that used for CD is allocated to each track. At the same time, L/R signals are alternated, and even / odd numbers are exchanged, and two track interleaving is applied for recording, so that correction / correction can be made even if a burst error occurs in the longitudinal direction of the tape or if one of the two heads becomes unplayable.<br>In addition to Sony&#39;s original Super Strategy, the correction algorithm employs a feed-forward Super Strategy method that optimizes correction by anticipating error information. This algorithm realizes high reliability that can withstand repeated high-speed search and vibration resistance.<br><br>The tape transport mechanism employs a newly developed transport mechanism that applies the mechanism design technology developed in the development of Sony&#39;s 8 mm video.<br>First of all, the drive motors that control tape travel are arranged independently for the capstan, take-up reel, supply reel, and head drum rotation. All motors are BSL motors without brushes that change over time. In addition, the 4D. D. system is adopted in which four motors directly drive each part. This eliminates the inclusion that causes aging, such as belts, and achieves excellent rotational characteristics.<br>The servo system ensures driving stability at normal speeds and controls the relative speed to be constant during high-speed search.<br>In addition, the base unit that supports the entire mechanical block of the circuit system uses a non-magnetic material, high hard aluminum alloy, which combines the high rigidity of steel with the low Q (resonance mode) of aluminum, to maintain flatness over a long period of time and reduce resonance.<br>In addition, the entire mechanism is effectively dumped to further reduce resonance.<br>In the mechanism section, the components are arranged into four blocks to reduce variations in accuracy due to assembly.<br><br>The head uses the 3S (Sendust Slope Spattering) head, which has a track record of PCM recording of 8 mm video.<br>This head is unique to Sony and eliminates the pseudo-gap that occurs at the core boundary by using a special structure in which the Sendust core is placed at an angle. It eliminates interference caused by reproduced waves from the pseudo-gap.<br><br>The digital processing circuit employs a highly integrated LSI developed Shinkai that carries out enormous digital processing using two IC chips.<br>The size of each LSI is equivalent to more than 200000 transistors, contributing to the miniaturization of the digital part. In addition, all substrates containing these LSIs are processed by a single clock to eliminate adverse effects on sound caused by interference caused by different clocks.<br><br>The A/D converter uses the same type used in PCM processors for CD mastering to achieve high reliability.<br>A 16-bit a 16-bit 4-times oversampling digital filter. The sampling frequency at the stage of digital data is increased from 48 kHz to 192 kHz, which is 4 times higher than that of 48 kHz. This reduces the burden on the low-pass filter by moving unwanted high-frequency noise generated after D/A conversion away from the music signal. This allows the low-pass filter to be constructed as simple as third order and minimizes the negative impact on sound quality. In addition, the filter has an extremely slow attenuation characteristic, which greatly reduces the deterioration of the high-frequency group delay characteristic.<br>The A/D converter and D/A converter are L/R-independent, eliminating the phase shift between the L and R channels.<br><br>It has a separate structure in which the digital part, audio part and system control part are separated.<br>The boundary of each block is blocked by a shield chassis, and the digital signal processor is covered with a シールオケース to prevent unwanted radiation from the digital signal processor and system control from entering the audio section.<br><br>The audio section is a twin monaural configuration with independent L/R channels to ensure simple and straight transmission that avoids signal routing as much as possible. In addition, the chassis surrounding the audio section is a copper plated chassis to prevent adverse effects of the season on due to the season, but also increases overall body rigidity and vibration resistance.<br><br>In the power supply section, the power supply for the digital section and servo system and the power supply for the audio section are completely independent from the stage of the transformer. Thus, the interference of the power supply to the audio section due to the sudden current fluctuation of the digital section and servo system is eliminated.<br>In addition, in order to share a common grounding point, the two transformers are sealed in one case with filler material, greatly reducing the vibration of the transformer, which affects sound quality.<br><br>All the constituent parts of the audio circuit are carefully selected, and high-quality parts such as wiring with oxygen-free copper with little signal degradation, bus grounding made of pure copper with low earth impedance, and Serafine condenser for power supply circuit are introduced.<br><br>Digital input / output terminals are installed in addition to analog input / output terminals.<br><br>It enables a variety of tape plays using subcodes. It includes AMS (Automatic Music Sensor) functions based on Start ID, automatic writing of Start ID, manual writing of Start ID / rehearsal functions, Music Scan, direct selection by program number, renumbering function, skip function and erase function.<br><br>In addition to basic operation display such as 3-mode linear counter, wide-range peak level meter, program No, AMS, and memory display, it is equipped with a multi-display that centrally displays operation status information such as start ID / skip ID display, sampling frequency display, and condensation warning display.<br><br>Equipped with a 3-mode linear counter with 3-mode switching : counter display showing the running time of the tape, remaking display showing the remaining time to the end of the tape, and program time display showing the elapsed time of the music being played.<br><br>Equipped with a wide range peak level meter of -50dB to 0 dB in each 28 segments of L and R.<br>It also uses full-bit 0 dB display, the same as commercial digital audio equipment.<br><br>A linear skating system is adopted in which the tray is pulled out when the cassette is installed and the tape is loaded after it is closed.<br>In addition, a fail-safe design has been implemented so that there is no risk of trouble even if the cassette is set in the wrong direction or if an obstacle matches during opening and closing.<br><br>It is equipped with a queue / review function that allows you to listen to recorded content at about twice the speed, a blank search function that automatically searches for parts that have never been recorded, an autoplay function that moves to playback immediately after rewinding, and a memory play function that automatically rewinds to the position of the counter 0 set and plays back automatically.<br><br>With an emphasis on sound quality with full-bit recording, pre-emphasis (recording) is turned off and de-emphasis (playback) is equipped with an automatic ON/OFF function.<br><br>Uses side wood and large insulator.<br><br>Uses a oxygen-free copper power cord with polarity display.<br><br>By combining the timer sold separately, it is possible to record the absence and play the alarm clock.<br><br>In addition to basic operations such as recording / playback / fast forward / rewind, it comes with a wireless remote control that enables operations such as writing and erasing subcodes and switching counter modes.</p>
