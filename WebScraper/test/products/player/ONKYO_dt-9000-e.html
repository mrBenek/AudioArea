				<p class="detail">DAT deck using linear single bit system.<br><br>In order to review the basics of AD/DA conversion and to solve various problems, a linear single-bit AD/DA converter has been adopted.<br>In single-bit DA conversion, there is no error in the amplitude direction in principle, no distortion caused by the operation shift of the bit switch, and there is no glitch because the time axis error is controlled with high precision by Onkyo crystal oscillation circuit technology.<br>In addition, a single-bit type AD converter is adopted, and the waveform transmission is made faithful by 64 times oversampling, third order noise shaving, two stage digital filter, and low-order low-pass filter (third order), and the generation of unnecessary components such as 0 cross distortion and differential non-linear distortion caused by conventional AD converters is suppressed.<br><br>The PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) circuit used in the digital-to-analog conversion process has two PWM converters to solve problems such as deep modulation due to strong signals and distortion when the modulation frequency becomes high.<br>These two PWM circuits are operated in complimentary service, and each output is input to a distortion canceler circuit to cancel out the distortion components and output only the audio signal.<br><br>A high-precision integrated aluminum die cast is adopted for the chassis that supports the mechanism, and the inclined post on the tape winding side is fixed to this chassis in order to further improve the tape travel accuracy.<br>A direct drive system is adopted for the head cylinder and capstan drive. The cylinder motor is equipped with a high-torque magnet with / without spring yoke. The capstan motor is designed with high inertia and high FG frequency with rotational fluctuation due to disturbance reduced to 1/2 compared with conventional models.<br><br>The rotary head, which rotates at a high speed of 2000 revolutions per minute, uses a high-precision SSB (Silent Shaft Bearing) for the cylinder, greatly reducing mechanical noise caused by high-speed rotation.<br>In addition, the machining accuracy of the cylinder has been revised to achieve excellent quietness.<br><br>Various modes of mechanism-related operations such as cylinder rotation, capstan rotation, and automatic track finding (ATF) control are controlled in an integrated manner by a large-scale dedicated processor.<br><br>Both FF and REW are equipped with a variable search function of up to 400 times speed, realizing high speed in which a 120 minute tape can be wound in only 27 seconds.<br><br>You can enjoy dubbing editing by ID recording using the subcode area.<br>The ID can be rewritten or deleted, and there is also a playback mode that ignores the ID. Therefore, editing contents can be changed and the original state can be saved at the same time.<br><br>Equipped with digital control fade in and fade out dedicated buttons for smooth and reliable fade.<br><br>In order to protect the copyright of recordings, the SCMS method is adopted, which prohibits recording with digital signals from tapes that have already been recorded digitally.<br>Copying by the analog method is possible.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
