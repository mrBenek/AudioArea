				<p class="detail">CD player for better sound quality and higher reliability.<br><br>The internal circuit board consists of the transport section, power supply section, decoder section, D/A converter to analog output section, and display control section. These circuit boards are placed with sufficient space between them to eliminate interference between elements and circuits that can cause sound quality degradation. They are also placed adjacent to each other at an angle of 90 degrees.<br>Since these boards are plug-in type, it is possible to upgrade by exchanging each circuit board.<br><br>The internal structure of the PCD is a rigid frame structure using aluminum pull-out material with a transport mechanism at the center. This is based on the same principle as that used in building construction. It does not generate resonance for both high-frequency and low-frequency vibrations, and works effectively for vibration control.<br>The cabinet interior of the PCD, including the frame structure, is coated with conductive paint and anti-rust treatment to prevent accumulation of static electricity.<br><br>The transport mechanism is Philips&#39; CDM1MKII.<br><br>It is equipped with an 18-bit monolithic D/A converter from Bar Brown for the highest quality audio. In addition, to minimize noise and distortion, each DAC is fully tested for power supply, and the MSB is carefully adjusted as installed prior to shipment.<br><br>The digital filter uses a high-precision type with 8 times oversampling.<br>Oversampling to avoid quantization noise may lead to resolution degradation due to jitter distortion if the oversampling is too high, so PCD selects 8 x oversampling to maximize the sound quality advantage of the technology at that time.<br><br>Each circuit of the PCD, including the D/A converter circuit, is a hybrid system with selected elements to achieve the best performance, and the PCD uses a continuous power supply system to maximize the performance of the parts.<br><br>The main power switch is located on the back panel of the unit and normally uses the standby power switch on the front panel to ensure stable operation of each part.<br><br>The power supply section is equipped with a power supply circuit equivalent to a high-precision measuring instrument, incorporating Mark Levinson&#39;s expertise in preamp design. To prevent interference between circuits via power supply lines, a total of 13 power supplies are supplied, and 12 of them are regulated independently. For example, in the audio output circuit alone, a total of four regulation circuits are provided to supply power independently to the plus and minus channels of the left and right channels.<br><br>We have also made unique efforts to reduce the impedance of the grounding circuit and to set the optimum grounding point.<br><br>One unbalanced and one balanced analog output terminal and one coaxial digital output terminal are installed.<br><br>It comes with a wireless remote control that allows you to operations except power ON/OFF and disk tray IN/OUT.</p>
