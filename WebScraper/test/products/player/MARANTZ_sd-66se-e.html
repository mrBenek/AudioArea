				<p class="detail">This is an improved special edition cassette deck based on SD-66.<br>Many improvements such as toroidal transformer have been made.<br><br>Various technologies have been put into the mechanism to ensure the ideal tape running.<br>A die-cast head base with integrated parts that control the running and a fly wheel made of high-precision high-weight ceramic. A closed-loop dual capstan system that realizes stable tape head touch. A cassette half stabilizer that effectively eliminates microvibration and modulation distortion of the cassette half realizes stable tape running performance.<br><br>The head part is equipped with a recording / re-combination head, and the core material uses high hardness permalloy with excellent magnetic characteristics.<br>In addition, the head coil is made of PC-OCC (single-crystal high-purity oxygen-free copper material) to minimize signal loss and provide optimal gap settings for recording and playback.<br><br>The recording and playback amplifiers are independent from each other to achieve a low noise level.<br>The recording amplifier uses a constant current drive system that can supply the required current without being affected by the inductive impedance of the recording head.<br>The first stage of the regenerative amplifier uses a low-noise FET in a differential configuration, reflecting the know-how of phono amplifier circuits cultivated in high-grade amplifiers and realizing an improved S/N ratio.<br><br>Equipped with the Dolby HX PRO, which works only during recording and improves high-frequency characteristics, and Dolby B/C with MPX filter.<br><br>The power supply section employs a toroidal transformer to solve problems such as leakage flux and vibration of the tape running mechanism.<br><br>It is equipped with a powerful noise killer circuit to deal with rectification noise, which has a large effect on sound quality even by a very small amount, and absorbs high-frequency noise generated during rectification.<br><br>The body uses a copper-plated chassis to prevent high frequencies from jumping into other elements.<br>In addition, by adopting a 3 mm thick vibration-proof top cover, vibration from the outside is reduced due to its weight, and it becomes a double vibration-proof countermeasure.<br><br>It uses a large display equipped with functions such as a linear tape counter that can switch the elapsed time from a normal tape counter, a mode character display that displays operation status with characters such as digital characters, and a digital peak level indicator with a 5-second peak level display and a MAX peak level memory function.<br><br>It is equipped with a QMS (Quick Music Sensor) that starts out the songs you want to listen to, an AMS (Automatic Music Scan) that plays the intro of each song for about 10 seconds one after another, and a blank skip function that detects unrecorded parts during playback and automatically fast-forwards.<br><br>An auto tape selector that automatically identifies metal, chrome, and normal tape types, a REC calibration that corrects the recording sensitivity of the tape to make the best use of the tape characteristics, a cassette in indicator that notifies the standby of the cassette tape by turning on, and an anti-rec indicator that turns on when the tab for preventing the erasure of the tape is broken.<br><br>The input / output terminals are equipped with a line input Route 3 and two line outputs (one Fixedx and one Variablex), all of which are gold-plated.</p>
