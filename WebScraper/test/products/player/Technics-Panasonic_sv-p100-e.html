				<p class="detail">A PCM cassette recorder that integrates advanced electronic circuit technology and video tape mechanism.<br><br>PCM (Pulse Code Modulation) is used as the recording method.<br>In PCM, the original sound waveform is converted into a binary signal through the process of sampling, quantization, and coding, and then recorded. By this process, complex music signals are converted into simplified signals to minimize degradation.<br>This PCM recording method does not generate any modulation distortion or wow flutter, and realizes flat-frequency characteristics, wide dynamic range, and reduction of harmonic distortion, enabling high-quality recording and playback.<br><br>The integrated configuration of the PCM processor and VTR enables easy PCM recording and playback.<br>Since the signal recording type is based on the &quot;EIAJ&quot; standard, it is compatible with the PCM recording system of the same standard.<br><br>Two large-scale LSIs are used for PCM digital signal processing.<br>The MN6601 is a recording LSI that integrates approximately 10,000 elements. It adds error detection and correction codes to A-to-D converted digital data and sends it as video data.<br>The MN6602 is a playback LSI that integrates approximately 15000 elements. It performs decoding and error correction on the reproduced PCM digital signal and supplies as serial data to a D/A converter.<br><br>We have developed and adopted dedicated LSIs for A/D, D/A conversion and peripheral logic circuits.<br>The A/D converter is equipped with MA6183, and the D/A converter is equipped with MD6192. They were developed using hard thin film IC technology and precision trimming technology.<br>In addition, peripheral logic circuits such as timing generation circuits for A/D and D/A converters are integrated into a single chip using high-speed and high-density IIL developed by our own new process development. High-density wiring with two layers of aluminum is used, and Schottky composite is used for external buffer section to realize high-speed bipolar LSI with approximately 1100 gates.<br><br>In pursuit of usability, the tape operation control part adopts a control concentrated design with full logic control.<br>The recording level can be adjusted independently on the left and right, and a single fader for easy fade-in / fade-out is installed.<br>You can also press the FF key while holding down the PLAY key to move the tape forward at 8 x speed for queue control, and you can also press the rew key while holding down the PLAY key to move backward at 8 x speed for review control.<br><br>When the jump mark lever is turned ON, a jump mark is recorded only during that time, and after that, it automatically jumps over that part and starts playback.<br>Also, if you press the clear lever to play, the jump mark signal will be erased.<br><br>Equipped with a search function to find an arbitrary position on the tape.<br>During recording and playback, when the searchmark lever is lowered, a searchmark is recorded on the tape. With one push of the lever, a searchmark is automatically recorded for 70 seconds, the LED lights up, and when the search key is pressed, queue control mode is automatically activated, and the tape stops at the marked position.<br>Also, if you press the play key after pressing the search key, the player automatically enters the play state from the position of the search mark.<br>This mark can also be erased by playing it by pressing the clear lever like jump mark.<br><br>It is equipped with a location function that allows arbitrary positioning by the memory operation of the tape counter and the locate key.<br>If you set the button of the locate section to the memory position, the counter position at that point is recorded. If you set it to the memory position, the tape stops at that counter position when you press the ff or rew key. If you press the play key while holding down the ff or rew key, the tape automatically enters the play state from the memory position.<br><br>Equipped with a liquid crystal tape counter and peak level indicator.<br>The level indicator is equipped with a peak hold function and a playback data check function that shows the quality of the tape being used at a glance.<br><br>Equipped with a digital in/out connector capable of digital dubbing.<br><br>Equipped with a remote control terminal and left and right microphone terminals.<br><br>Timer recording is available.</p>
