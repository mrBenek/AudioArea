				<p class="detail">Stereo cassette deck with pure independent 3 heads.<br><br>The head part is equipped with 3 independent heads, and by enabling the azimuth adjustment of the head independently for recording and playback, the stability of the stereo is made clearer and superior high frequency characteristics are realized.<br>In addition, a separator is installed between the recording head and the reproducing head to eliminate not only the magnetic cross field generated between the heads but also the electrical cross field generated by the head wiring.<br>The head material is amorphous, which has excellent high-frequency characteristics, and fine amorphous, which combines the characteristics of a wire alloy head, which has excellent magnetic characteristics and abrasion resistance. Moreover, signal loss is greatly reduced by using PC-OCC for the coil winding and lead wire of the head.<br><br>An arc base is installed in the lower part of the chassis to eliminate the influence on the sound caused by vibration when the mechanism operates and resonance generated by external sound.<br>This arc base is a high-density compression molded board made by compressing and pressing needle material of about 1 kg which is resistant to vibration and resonance. By mounting mechanism and transformer directly on it, each weight is increased equivalently, and operating vibration and external vibration are absorbed.<br><br>It is equipped with a newly developed Airtight electric cassette door to cope with external sound pressure from the opening.<br>It is equipped with an ultra-fine artificial leather Airtight liner that absorbs vibration without natural vibration in order to increase the adhesion with the body. It is opened and closed electrically to further increase the adhesion and block the sound from the speaker.<br>In addition, the vibration of the cassette half itself is held by the half shell stabilizer, and acoustic modulation noise is greatly reduced to realize clearer sound.<br><br>Closed-loop dual capstan system is adopted for the mechanism part.<br>Capstan and pinch rollers are arranged on both sides of the independent head, and by keeping the tension from the beginning to the end of winding the tape constant, a stable head touch is always obtained. By combining this method with DD motor, sound loss such as stability of head touch, uneven rotation, noise reduction during rotation, etc. is suppressed.<br>In addition, zinc die-cast is used for the mechanical base to increase the durability of the mechanism itself and greatly improve the verticality, parallelism, and vibration resistance of the capstan and pinch roller shaft. In addition, total modulation noise is reduced by using the vibration control capstan base and die-cast head base.<br>As for tape running accuracy, a 3-phase 6-coil Ceralock servo direct drive motor realizes low wow flutter.<br><br>The direct input reduces the influence of the circuit when recording sound from a source such as CD.<br>To prevent noise from entering the signal path and degradation of the signal, a remote bar is used for the selector so that the front panel operation is directly controlled near the rear panel input terminal.<br><br>As a noise reduction system, in addition to Dolby B/C NR, Dolby HX PRO is installed.<br>The Dolby HX PRO is a system that controls the effective bias to be constant according to the fluctuation of the input signal during recording. It greatly improves the high-frequency dynamic range. It is effective even when played on devices that do not have the Dolby HX PRO.<br><br>In order to solve this problem, the digital part of the operation system is concentrated in one place and separated from the analog part, and the whole analog part is shielded by BOX to prevent interference.<br>The control system also has a function to turn off the display during recording and playback. Even when the display is off, it turns on during stop, fast forward, rewind, or pause, and turns off automatically when recording or playback starts.<br><br>Equipped with an oscillator, level bias adjustment suitable for tape characteristics can be easily performed.<br><br>The audio circuit is composed of ± 2 power supply DC amplifier without condenser as much as possible for both recording and reproduction.<br>The recording amplifier uses a high-bias method (210 kHz) to prevent interference with the bias frequency from adversely affecting the music signal.<br><br>Equipped with an auto monitor.<br>During recording, the sound of the recorded tape is automatically switched, and during pause standby, the sound of the source is automatically switched.<br><br>Equipped with an automatic music selection function.<br><br>Uses an OFC power cord with polarity indication.<br><br>Uses gold-plated output terminal.<br><br>Equipped with timer start function, it is possible to combine with separately sold timer.<br><br>Equipped with a headphone port with volume.<br><br>Equipped with a memory button.<br><br>Equipped with an auto tape selector.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
