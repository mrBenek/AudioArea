				<p class="detail">CD player with TEAC&#39;s original ZD circuit.<br><br>ZD circuit is used for the D/A conversion part.<br>In the D/A conversion, quantization distortion occurs at the time of conversion, and this quantization distortion tends to increase especially at low levels and when the input level is slowly converted. To reduce this, a method using a kind of digital signal called dither signal was known in theory, but in reality, it had not been put into practical use due to the capacity of the D/A converter and the difficulty of subtraction processing to extract the dither component from the analog signal.<br>TEAC took note of this problem and developed an ZD circuit as a D/A conversion method using dither signals, which is incorporated into the ZD 5000.<br>The ZD circuit adds a 12-bit dither signal to the input digital signal and converts it directly into analog signal through a high-resolution D/A converter. Only the dither component is accurately removed from the analog signal, thereby dispersing quantization distortion and greatly reducing odd order harmonic distortion, which is considered harmful to hearing.<br>In addition to the original effect of dither by introducing a dither signal, the error of the D/A converter can be averaged and the accuracy of the D/A converter is improved to minimize product variations.<br>In the ZD 5000, the analog parts including the D/A converter are configured independently on the left and right sides in order to reduce mutual interference and cross modulation distortion. The most important part is enclosed in a 64-pin one chip LSI (ZD Digital LSI) to improve reliability.<br><br>Equipped with 2 x oversampling digital filter.<br>By doubling the sampling frequency with the digital filter to 88.2 kHz, unwanted high-frequency components can be pushed up to 60 kHz, so that the low-pass filter curve can be adjusted gently to protect the very high-frequency components that are important for expressing the mood and nuance of music.<br><br>The pickup section uses a high-speed 3-beam laser pickup driven by a linear motor.<br>In addition to the main beam that reads the music signal from the disc, the 3-beam Laser Pickup uses two sub-beams dedicated to tracking servo. When tracking error occurs, the sub-beam quickly catches the error, feeds back to the position correction of the main beam, and accurately reads the information contained in the disc.<br>In addition, by adopting a linear motor drive for the pickup drive, access speed is twice as high as that of conventional models, while operating noise is reduced and access is smooth.<br><br>A floating insulation system is used for the whole signal reading part including the pickup to shut out external vibration.<br><br>It has a 20-track random memory program function.<br><br>It is equipped with a direct random play function, and you can directly cue the music you specify with 10 keys.<br><br>Equipped with a one touch song selection function, you can search the head of the current or next song with one touch.<br><br>It has an intro check function, and you can play the head part of each song for 10 seconds one after another.<br>If you press the PLAY button during an intro check, the music will be played from that song.<br><br>Equipped with manual search.<br>It is possible to carry out a continuous manual search in two and then speeds up.<br><br>It is equipped with an index search, and by specifying an index number, you can find out the beginning of a song in more detail.<br><br>It is possible to play all songs / memory / A-B with 3 types of copy and playback.<br><br>Timer playback is possible by linking with the separately sold timer.<br><br>Equipped with two outputs, fixed and variable.<br>The ZD 5000 can also control the output level by remote control.<br><br>It uses a multi-function display that allows you to instantly check the status of the disc and player, such as song number, index number, playing time, etc.<br><br>It is equipped with one touch front loading function, and when you set the disk and press the PLAY button, it automatically loads and moves to regenerating condition.<br><br>It comes with a wireless remote control that allows you to do most of the operation at hand.</p>
