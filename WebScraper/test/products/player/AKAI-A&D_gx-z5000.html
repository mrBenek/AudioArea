				<p class="detail">A cassette deck developed by inheriting the design philosophy of GX-Z9000/GX-Z7000.<br><br>LC-OFOFC twin field super GX head is adopted for the recording / reproducing head.<br>The Super GX Head is made of ferrite, which has excellent electromagnetic conversion characteristics and dynamic characteristics in the high-frequency band, and is processed with extremely high precision using our original processing technology. It reduces loss in the high-frequency band and realizes wide frequency characteristics and low distortion rate. It also has excellent abrasion resistance, does not easily adhere to dust, and maintains excellent initial characteristics for a long period of time.<br>The Twin-Field Super GX Head is based on a head with these features and has independent recording and playback gaps in the head housing to achieve the same recording and playback quality as a 3-head system.<br>In addition, the GX-Z5000 head uses LC-OFC for the core winding to reduce transmission distortion.<br><br>The transport mechanism is equipped with the DD transport mechanism equipped with A &amp; D&#39;s unique dual-wide tape guide. Equipped with the dual-wide tape guide, it realizes stable tape movement, good head touch, and eliminates level fluctuation and dropout.<br><br>A unique silent mechanism has been adopted to improve operability and reduce noise.<br><br>The playback amplifier is equipped with an amplifier designed based on the basic concept of simple and straight, and uses a DC amplifier configuration with an emphasis on sound quality.<br><br>In order to shut out high-frequency noise components emitted by the microcomputer that operates the mechanism, it is equipped with an independent power supply and an EMI (electromagnetic interference) filter to suppress interference to the signal system.<br>In addition, an isolated spacer is used in the power transformer to prevent mixing of high-frequency noise components from the power supply.<br><br>It uses carefully selected audio parts such as EBET (folded electrode transistor), LC-OFC winding, MPX filter with low distortion core, high tone resistance, etc.<br><br>Equipped with Dolby HX Pro system.<br>The Dolby HX Pro System supplies the head with an optimum recording bias according to the spectrum and level of the music signal, thereby greatly improving the high-frequency saturation characteristics for high-level recording and demonstrating its power for recording music with many high-frequency components.<br><br>Equipped with Dolby B-CNR as a noise reduction system.<br>The Dolby C greatly reduces hissing and expands the dynamic range, and achieves high resolution with a ± 2 power stabilization circuit.<br><br>Equipped with manual bias control.<br>The recording bias value can be controlled within ± 20% by installing an Slave bias oscillation circuit exclusively for recording bias.<br><br>Equipped with SPOT ERASE system.<br>With this function, if you press the REC CANCEL key after specifying an unwanted section with the A-B keys during playback, the section is automatically deleted using a high-precision counter and an arithmetic circuit for correcting the head position.<br>In addition, the 1/2 speed mode makes it possible to set high precision even for short unnecessary sections.<br><br>It is equipped with the AUTO REPEAT system, and if you specify the section you want to listen to repeatedly during playback, you can repeat playback for that section.<br><br>If you have a built-in REC CANCEL system and you want to cancel the recording halfway after starting recording, press REC CANCEL to rewind to the starting point and return to the REC pause.<br><br>High rigidity is achieved by high strength bottom plate and large foot, and harmful vibration and resonance are reduced.<br><br>Equipped with multi-functional centralized display.<br><br>It is equipped with the computer search function of IPSS which enables you to cancel REC, introscan, and skip 16 songs before and after.<br><br>Direct Lead-In &amp; Power Eject, Auto Tape Selector, Auto Monitor, etc.<br><br>Equipped with an autoplay function that plays automatically after rewinding.<br><br>Equipped with an auto-mute mechanism that creates a 4-second space between songs.<br><br>Equipped with headphone volume.<br><br>Equipped with a timer start mechanism.<br><br>Equipped with an MPX filter, it is possible to cut the pilot signal mixed during air check.<br><br>Uses a power cord with polarity display.</p>
