				<p class="detail">A double cassette deck with a rich editing function.<br><br>In addition to single-sided constant-speed and double-speed dubbing, simultaneous double-speed dubbing of both A and B sides is also possible.<br>Duplex simultaneous double-speed dubbing allows double-speed dubbing of the whole A side from the head and B side from the back without changing the cassette. Even with C-60 tape, dubbing can be completed in 15 minutes.<br>Three different dubbing styles can be selected depending on the dubbing schedule.<br><br>Noise reduction can be turned ON/OFF during dubbing (only at constant speed) and the level can be adjusted during dubbing.<br><br>It is equipped with a program / auto-double-speed editing function that allows you to dub in your favorite order of songs. You can freely set the order of up to 10 songs to be played on Deck I and start editing dubbing in the specified order by pressing the dubbing key. This function can be used only at single-sided constant speed / single-sided double-speed.<br><br>The dubbing operation is simplified by the synchronized dubbing mechanism that synchronizes the start of Deck I and II.<br>In addition, a synchronized terminal for the LX-7 linear player for random program selection is mounted.<br><br>The mixer allows you to play sound effects from Deck I while recording on Deck II, for example, and to fade the sound in and out freely in the mixer.<br>In addition, by connecting another external deck, you can record the sound you mixed yourself.<br><br>It is equipped with an independent monitor mechanism so that Deck I can be used independently even when Deck II is recording.<br><br>With the random music selection function and music center function, you can quickly start your head.<br>In addition, it is equipped with a memory selection mechanism of 10 songs, and you can memory the songs in your favorite order.<br><br>Multiple recordings can be made by playing the source recorded on Deck II on Deck I and mixing recording on Deck II.<br><br>An SH head is used for the recording / reproducing head, a wide-gap recording head with less magnetic saturation even for large inputs, and a narrow-gap reproducing head with improved high-frequency characteristics.<br><br>Two DC servo motors and two DC motors are used for the mechanism part.<br><br>A Dolby B/C is installed as a noise reduction system.<br><br>Equipped with an auto tape selector that automatically detects the type of tape and automatically sets the bias / equalizer value that is best for the tape.<br>In addition, a bias fine adjustment mechanism is incorporated to take advantage of the performance of the tape.<br><br>Equipped with an auto-repeat function that repeatedly plays back one side of the tape endlessly.<br><br>It is equipped with Cue &amp; Review function which is convenient for beginning and phrase of the song.<br><br>Equipped with an auto-rec mute function that automatically creates blank sections between songs with one touch.<br><br>It is equipped with a headphone monitor switch that can switch between 3 stages of simultaneous playback of Deck I/II.<br><br>It has a recording volume with a click point.<br><br>By combining the separately sold timer, you can play the alarm clock on the Deck I and record messages on the Deck II.</p>
