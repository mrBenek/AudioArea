				<p class="detail">A computer-controlled full-auto player with centralized computer control.<br><br>It is equipped with a 4-bit microcomputer. By detecting and processing signals from the front switch and various detection mechanisms, almost all functions of the player, from variable rotation quartz lock to auto size / auto speed selector, memory repeat, arming, etc. are controlled centrally.<br><br>The motor is equipped with a unitorque motor based on Lordi&#39;s proprietary technology.<br>The Unitorque Motor is a motor which obtained perfect circular motion from the principle. It consists of a doughnut-shaped rotor magnet magnetized with 8 poles and two sets of star-shaped flat coils offset by 22 ^ 5 degrees. The torque generated by these two coils and magnets is constant at any moment. This principle is called sin<sup>2</sup>Θ + cos<sup>2</sup>Θ = 1 &quot;. The Uni-Torque Motor also adopts a simple structure that is brushless, slotless and coreless, and has significantly improved durability.<br>The HT-860 has adopted a quartz lock, and by adopting a quartz lock for fine adjustment of speed, pitch control up to 0.1% step ± 9.9% is possible.<br><br>Equipped with an auto size / auto speed selector.<br>By the combination of light source and photoelectric sensor, the size and speed are automatically detected just by placing the record, and the needle tip is automatically inserted into the position that matches the record size.<br>Therefore, you can enjoy playing a record without touching the size selector.<br>* For the record of 45 rpm for 30 cm and 33 1/3rpm for 17 cm, you need to set the speed manually.<br><br>Non-contact detection opto-electronic full auto mechanism is adopted, and all full auto functions such as auto-in position and Oatley turn detection are performed by non-contact opto-electronic sensor.<br><br>It uses Lordi&#39;s original electronic memory repeat, and it can be played 1 to 9 times repeatedly.<br><br>A non-touch type arm swing mechanism is adopted, and the tone arm can be moved to any position on the record only by operation of the front panel without touching the tone arm.<br><br>Separate motors are used for the horizontal and vertical drive of the tone arm. It can respond to commands later, such as when the auto operation needs to be changed in the middle. Complex movements such as horizontal and minute drive of the arm can be performed accurately.<br><br>Equipped with a digital display panel, it digitally displays the number of revolutions, pitch control, record size and repeat revolutions processed by a computer.<br><br>It can also be used as a manual player. When the head shell is held by hand, the full-auto mechanism clutch is disengaged and manual operation is automatically performed.<br><br>Lightweight and highly rigid magnesium die-cast is used for the head shell.<br>In addition, it is equipped with a gold-plated chucking lock type head shell connector that reduces play and increases rigidity, and a one touch type arm height adjustment mechanism with an adjustment range of 6 mm.<br><br>It is equipped with an electronic brake system, a mechanism to prevent misoperation when a computer control record is left open, and a timer start mechanism.<br><br>The turntable weighs about 2 kg and has a sensitive mass of 300g ・ cm.<sup>2</sup>Heavy duty turntable, and butyl rubber is used for the turntable sheet.<br><br>It is equipped with double insulators that emphasize acoustic characteristics.</p>
