				<p class="detail">A top-operation CD player developed using Technics&#39; Class AA and other high-quality sound technologies.<br><br>The pickup section is equipped with an FF-1 laser pickup that uses a single-beam system, which has higher laser light utilization efficiency than the conventional three beam system and can greatly improve the S / N ratio of reproduced signals.<br>The FF-1 Laser Pickup generated by a plate-type half-mirror for focusing, detects the phase component of vibration modulation due to pits for tracking, and combines it with a digital accu-servo system with high signal reproduction capability to improve playability against scratches and fingerprints on the disc surface.<br>A brushless DD motor is used for the spindle motor to ensure high reliability and durability.<br><br>A sample-and-hold circuit that samples and holds the output signal of a D/A converter and eliminates switching noise requires driving a capacitive heavy load by charging a holding capacitor with a D/A sampling signal. Therefore, conventional circuit methods could not sufficiently transmit subtle nuances.<br>In the SL-P1200, by adopting the classAA method for this circuit, the voltage-controlled amplifier for waveform transmission and the current-driven amplifier for capacitive load charge / discharge are independent. This allows the voltage-controlled amplifier to operate under no-load conditions, and the output of the D/A converter is directly taken out in current mode, reducing the settling time to 1 / 10 of the conventional one.<br><br>The buffer amplifier of an audio circuit is subject to a complex combination of loads such as the input impedance of the pre-amplifier to be connected and the capacitive load of the connecting cable. This circuit is also equipped with a classAA circuit so that the voltage-controlled amplifier can transmit waveform stably regardless of the connected load.<br><br>The D/A converter realizes strict simultaneous L/R conversion by installing a converter dedicated to Lch/Rch, and eliminates the phase shift between channels.<br>In addition, the dual use of the D/A converter and the classAA sample-and-hold circuit configuration reduces the hold time of the sample-and-hold capacitor, which is susceptible to interference from other circuits, to 1/3 of the conventional one, resulting in a significant improvement in the SN ratio.<br><br>The digital filter uses Technics&#39;s own Super Clean Digital Filter.<br>This circuit employs a newly developed 96th order digital filter (MN6618A) combined with a 7th order high-precision analog low-pass filter. This improves the phase and frequency characteristics in the audio band, as well as a low-distortion effect and improved sound quality.<br><br>The audio circuit components include copper foil styrene capacitors and electrolytic capacitors for audio containing fine ceramic particles to improve resolution in the high-frequency range.<br>In addition, the low-pass filter, which consists of modules, is designed to ensure high sound quality. For example, even the printed wiring material on the ceramic substrate is selected after a sound quality check.<br><br>It is equipped with a fader using PCLN (Pure Conductive Low Noise) resistor for variable audio output.<br>This fader uses a mirror-finished resistor and multi-contact brush to achieve low distortion and low noise, and can directly drive the main amplifier.<br><br>In order to prevent noise from the digital system, a serial transmission method is adopted. Digital data, which is the input signal for the audio circuit, is transmitted through a single signal line to improve the SN ratio in the sense of hearing.<br><br>In order to prevent the effects of external vibration such as sound pressure vibration and floor vibration, as well as self-vibration caused by internal vibration sources, the chassis section is provided with thorough vibration-free and vibration-free measures.<br>In order to reduce the effect of vibration caused by sound pressure, we have adopted a 3-layer structure base for the base section. This base is composed of three materials : a metal chassis base, special damping rubber, and TNRC (Technics Non-Resonance Compound). This base provides sufficient weight and mechanical strength, as well as excellent braking effect by converting vibration energy into thermal energy. In addition, we have adopted a solid, precision zinc die cast integrated molding structure for the cabinet, and by integrating it with the 3-layer base, excellent vibration isolation structure is realized.<br>In addition, a double insulator system is adopted to cut off floor vibration. Four large insulators cut off vibration transmitted to the player body, and the most important optical deck is floated from the body to attenuate vibration.<br>An insulator is also used to float the power transformer, which is a source of internal vibration.<br><br>In order to prevent noise from the digital circuit and servo circuit, the audio circuit section is separated into blocks including the power supply section on an independent board. The power supply transformer is a two transformer system with a dedicated transformer for digital and audio. The dedicated transformer for audio is Lch and Rch, and the headphone amplifier are each wound separately. A dedicated clear current circuit and a stabilizing power supply circuit are provided to thoroughly prevent interference from other circuits. Four 3,300 μ F electrolytic capacitors for audio are used for the rectifying circuit.<br>In addition, the sample-and-hold circuit has a double regulator configuration to improve the SN ratio.<br><br>It is equipped with a 2-speed search dial, and by turning the dial with the finger tip, it is possible to get a minute cue like a manual, which was impossible with conventional CD players. The playback speed per rotation can be selected from 2 modes of about 1 second (slow) and about 30 seconds (fast). When it is set to the slow side, precision access is possible in units of 1/25 second at the minimum.<br><br>Equipped with a locking function, the pickup position can be locked in one track unit (approximately 0.13 seconds in the inner circumference) for easy timing adjustment.<br><br>With AutoCue, you can start music within 0.3 seconds of pressing the Start button by digitally detecting where music actually starts and putting it on standby.<br><br>Equipped with a time specified heading function, you can specify an index and time in addition to the music number.<br><br>Equipped with a high-speed linear access system that greatly reduces access time.<br>This mechanism is a shuttle bus feed mechanism using a high-precision linear motor. By refining the microcomputer control method, high-speed access is realized. In addition, there is no reduction mechanism such as a gear belt, quietness and durability are greatly improved.<br><br>The display is equipped with a 9-digit FL multi-display.<br>The time display section is a 4-mode switching system that allows you to display all songs (program songs) and the elapsed time and remaining time in the performance as needed. In addition, by providing the order of 0.1 second, it can be combined with a precise search function to enable fine timing adjustment.<br><br>With a built-in music matrix display, you can display the track number of up to 20 recorded or programmed songs on the disc.<br><br>Wireless remote control with 10 keys is included.<br>In addition to the main body functions such as direct music selection, this remote control is equipped with a digital attenuator function that can adjust the volume from 0 dB to -12dB in 2 dB increments, and a programmable music scan that sequentially plays the intro part of a song.</p>
