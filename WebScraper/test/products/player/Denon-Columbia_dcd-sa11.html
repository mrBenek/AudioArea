				<p class="detail">CD/SACD player equipped with Advanced AL24 Processing.<br><br>Advanced AL24 Processing is installed in the PCM signal reproduction system, which was first installed in DCD-SA1.<br>In addition to the data expansion from 16 bits to 24 bits by the conventional AL24 Processing, data interpolation on the time axis and up-conversion sampling are carried out by an algorithm developed by our company based on an approach including performance and sound quality. This realizes finer and natural interpolation reproduction without losing original data.<br>A large-capacity arithmetic processing device is used for the circuit, so that data samples can be taken over a wide range and processed in a single stage. Compared with multi-stage digital filters, signal interpolation with higher arithmetic accuracy is possible.<br>The filtering operation is also more adaptive. It controls the frequency characteristics outside the audible band even for dense music data and high-frequency continuous sounds, and performs filtering using the optimum algorithm. This enables optimal sound reproduction without the negative effects of aliasing noise and high-frequency response degradation.<br><br>The mechanism is equipped with DENON&#39;s original drive mechanism.<br>The drive motor for this mechanism uses a long-life brushless motor. The drive motor is placed close to the turntable to withstand the high-speed rotation of the SACD, and the motor shaft is designed to be extremely short.<br>In addition, in order to absorb variations in the tilt of the turntable and pickup mechanical base, all skew adjustments (tilt correction) are performed to achieve optimum playability.<br>The loader mechanism uses an S. V. H. loader, which is made of different materials and has enhanced anti-vibration effects. It supports stable data reading along with the optimally designed mechanical base floating.<br><br>The clock circuit is equipped with a high-precision oscillator with specifications close to those of DCD-SA1.<br>The circuit block of the oscillator is modularized, and stable oscillation accuracy is obtained without being affected by the substrate pattern.<br>In addition, we have adopted a method of supplying each device with a DAC as a master, as in the case of the high-grade equipment. In particular, the most important clock (DSD clock) for SACD playback is supplied to the slave DSD decoder after division generation, and to the master DAC after correcting to the accuracy of the oscillator again to ensure high accuracy. This method realizes playback with less influence of jitter.<br><br>Both the hot and cold sides of the balanced output receive the output directly from the dedicated D/A converter.<br>Unlike the balanced output by an inverting amplifier, this method does not cause a difference or delay in sound quality between hot and cold, and the circuit configuration is advantageous in noise and sound quality.<br>Unbalanced output is obtained by differential drive from balanced output.<br><br>The power supply unit has a twin transformer configuration in which the digital and analog systems are completely separated from the power transformer to eliminate mutual interference. In addition, the effect of the transformer itself is minimized by arranging the magnetic flux leakage in the direction to cancel each other.<br>Aluminum casting with excellent vibration damping characteristics is used for the mounting base to the chassis to suppress the vibration of the transformer itself, as well as the influence on each part and vibration from the outside.<br><br>Thorough anti-vibration measures are taken.<br>Using a flat plate structure of four bottom plates and two top plates, resonance in the plane direction is completely eliminated and s-lead from the outside is also suppressed. In addition, the side panel and rear panel have a two layer structure, and resonance is suppressed by combining different materials.<br>The main chassis has a center mounted mechanism for weight balance, and the entire main chassis is plated with copper to reduce the influence of inductive noise.<br><br>Sintered alloy insulators are used for the legs.<br>The center of gravity of the set is lowered by using a sintered alloy with high rigidity, high specific gravity and excellent vibration characteristics. In addition, unnecessary vibration is suppressed in a wide frequency band by special cushioning material.<br><br>It uses high-quality components selected for its track record in developing numerous digital players.<br>In addition, the audio circuit board is floated with fluorine-based resin.<br><br>Pre Direct Mode is included.<br>This is a mode that turns off the display and digital output. By turning off the pulse signal for driving the display and digital data, the audio signal is not affected.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
