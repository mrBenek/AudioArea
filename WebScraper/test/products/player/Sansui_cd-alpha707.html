				<p class="detail">A CD player with Sansui&#39;s traditional technology and vibration control.<br><br>SF (Solid &amp; Flex) mechanism is adopted for the mechanism part.<br>The SF mechanism consists of two components : a mechanical chassis and a play chassis. The mechanical chassis is firmly fixed to a solid chassis and the play chassis is floated from the mechanical chassis by a double suspension of an oil-damped NR damper and a stainless steel coil damper.<br>The tray is made of BMC material for high rigidity and high accuracy, and attention is paid to details such as a turntable made of special material with high friction coefficient to accurately hold the CD when rotating and a 4-point disk supporter to protect the CD.<br><br>Equipped with a CD centering mechanism using a magnet clamper.<br>The turntable part uses a special material with a large friction coefficient to eliminate slight slipping of the CD. In addition, the mechanism combines coil spring and center guide from the lower part and magnet clamper from the upper part to firmly hold the CD.<br>This reduces the load on the servo system and enables more accurate reading.<br><br>The servo circuit uses the NEW Sansui Dynamic Servo System, which was developed using the know-how of VFD (video film disk) development.<br>This circuit smoothly controls the four servos (tracking, focus, CLV, and feed) to achieve higher stability than before.<br><br>The pickup part uses an original 3-beam system pickup.<br>In this pickup, the spot interval between the three beams is set at 16 μ m, which improves the stability of the trace and enables quick response to scratches and dirt on the disk.<br>In addition, in order to increase the tracing capability, the support part of the pickup has been strengthened, and the rail support part where the pickup part moves is made to be die-cast structure, and moreover, it is made to be wide span, so that the stable operation of the pickup part is possible.<br><br>The digital filter uses a 2 x oversampling digital filter to improve sound quality without using a high-order low-pass filter, which deteriorates group delay characteristics.<br><br>The D/A converter uses a 16-bit linear-type D/A converter with less distortion especially at low levels.<br>In addition, it employs a 5.7 μ sec phase correction circuit that improves the time difference and phase characteristics of the left and right channels. The fifth order low-pass filter using LC-OFC material provides sound quality with excellent linearity.<br><br>A master clock system is adopted to prevent beam generation due to clock asynchronous of D/A converter and LSI.<br><br>Α -X balanced output is used for the output part.<br>In the α -X balanced output, the influence of common-mode noise is reduced by making the + side and - side of the signal path and grounding independent, and the output can be done without digital noise during transmission.<br><br>Equipped with balanced output terminal.<br><br>In order to avoid interference between the digital and analog sections and the drive section, the power supply section uses a three power supply system that employs a stabilized power supply for each of the servo system, digital system and audio system.<br>In addition, an AC line noise filter is built in as an AC line countermeasure.<br><br>A solid chassis is adopted for the chassis structure, and high rigidity is achieved by separating the mechanism, digital and analog sections with a high rigidity separator. This prevents external vibration and also prevents adverse effects of vibration generated by the mechanism. In addition, the high conductivity of the separator shuts out electromagnetic noise, reducing the influence of noise in the mechanism and digital sections on analog circuits.<br><br>The CF5 (Chassis Fixed 5-point Support) insulator is used for the insulator. By supporting it with five large insulators, the load applied to the insulator is equalized, and the structure is resistant to external vibration.<br>CF5 CF5 insulator is mounted directly on a solid chassis to improve the overall structural integrity.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
