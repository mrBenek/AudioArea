				<p class="detail">This is a quick reverse deck developed using Akai&#39;s traditional reverse technology and technology cultivated in Total Advanced Deck.<br>Based on the GX-R6, the head has been changed and some functions have been omitted.<br><br>The mechanism section is based on the bi-counter capstan drive-type driving mechanism that has been used in reverse decks, and is equipped with a bi-directional symmetrical precision (BSP) mechanism that pursues precision.<br>Dedicated capstan shafts and pinch rollers are installed on the left and right sides of the head for forward and reverse respectively to realize a symmetrical tape travel system in which recording and re-recording conditions in both directions are identical.<br>At the time of reverse operation, the pinch roller makes a seesaw movement, and the operation is reversed instantly. At the same time, the head rotates 180 degrees. In both directions, Lch/Rch is recorded and played back using the same head gap and amplifier.<br>This allows for high-quality Oatley berth recording with little variation in reciprocating travel characteristics and recording / reconditioning, and with little noise blank feeling from the A side to the B side.<br><br>The Accurate : Reverse Head System has been developed and installed in the head part, based on AKAI&#39;s accumulated technologies up to that time, and combined with the reliability of the rotary type.<br>First of all, for the housing part which requires precision, we have adopted a zinc die-cast containing Beryllium, which shows 2 times the hardness and 8 times the abrasion resistance compared to ordinary zinc die-cast, and applied precision processing of μ order.<br>The rotating parts are precisely coated with a solid lubricant mainly composed of fluorine resin, which has good sliding properties, to greatly reduce the coefficient of friction and improve durability.<br>In addition, high hardness ceramic (purity 99% alumina) is adopted for the stopper part, and the impact caused by the rotation of the head is 100kg/cm.<sup>2</sup>22,000kg/cm for<sup>2</sup>In addition, the azimuth adjustment screw that receives the stopper uses a fine screw that is hardened stainless steel. The elasticity of stainless steel absorbs the impact of rotation while eliminating wear.<br>In addition, the loosening of adjustment screws, which is a problem in long-term use, is dealt with by the double nut method, and the return of the screws is locked.<br>Moreover, in order to make the most of mechanical durability and reliability, a roll-up flexible printed board is adopted for the lead wire from the head to the amplifier, which had been a problem in conventional rotary type, and rotation failure due to disconnection and entanglement is prevented by winding it spirally at the head part.<br>And, the rotation system adopts a double pinion drive with a dedicated motor that reliably operates in two gears.<br><br>The tape guide is separated to the left and right from the head and has a wide contact surface with the tape. It uses Akai&#39;s unique dual-wide tape guide. This prevents azimuth deviation and tape curl caused by cassette half misalignment, and is combined with the BSP mechanism to further stabilize the tape running.<br>A quiet mechanism driven by a dedicated cam motor controlled by a microcomputer controls mechanical sounds.<br><br>Uses an HD head.<br><br>As a noise reduction system, in addition to the Dolby B type, it is equipped with the Dolby C type, which has a higher noise reduction effect.<br><br>Equipped with IPLS (Automatic Head-Out) which finds the head of the next / current song with one touch.<br><br>A newly developed electronic volume is used for recording level control.<br>By using a microcomputer to change the volume, there is no volume noise due to aging degradation, and highly accurate control is possible.<br>The number of steps is 16. It increases or decreases one step at a time with one touch, and it changes continuously by pressing and holding.<br><br>Operation information such as 12-segment VU display bar meter, 4-digit electronic counter, REC level, reverse mode, type of noise reduction, tape position, travel direction, IPLS, REC mode, etc. is displayed centrally on the large 2-color FL tube for easy viewing.<br><br>Equipped with an auto tape selector that can determine the type of tape just by setting it in the cassette half, an auto mute that allows one touch mute recording during recording, and a reverse mode selector that allows you to select one way rerecording / reciprocating rerecording / endless playback.<br><br>Equipped with remote control mechanism and timer start mechanism, by connecting separately sold equipment, remote operation and timer recording can be performed.</p>
