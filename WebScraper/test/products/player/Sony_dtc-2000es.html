				<p class="detail">The reference DAT deck was created in pursuit of its function as a sound recorder in order to bring out the performance and sound quality of DAT.<br><br>In addition to the conventional 48 kHz mode (standard) and 32 kHz / LP mode, the analog input mode has a 44.1 kHz mode, making it possible to record in the same way as the CD format.<br><br>The front panel has a gold-plated microphone input terminal (2 standard jacks) and a low-noise microphone amplifier for stereo sound recording.<br><br>When recording, the high-frequency audio signal is emphasized and recorded, and when playing back, the audio signal level is returned to the original audio signal level even with inverse characteristics, so that the recording emphasis can be switched on / off to reduce harsh noise.<br>It also automatically detects and switches to emphasis during playback.<br><br>Serial Copy Management System (SCMS) is adopted as copy protection.<br>SCMS is capable of digital → digital recording for only one generation using a CD as a master. Digital → digital recording for the second generation or later is not possible using a recorded tape. Similarly, digital → digital recording for one generation is possible using a source recorded with an analog input, but digital → digital recording for the second generation or later is not possible.<br>If only analog input / output is used, recording can be repeated without restriction of SCMS.<br><br>In addition to two heads in a set for recording and playback, a 4-head head drum with two heads in a set exclusively for monitoring is installed. This makes it possible to monitor recording simultaneously with tape playback.<br><br>Equipped with 4D. D. motor mechanisms using independent direct drive motors for capstan, supply / take-up reel for fast forward / rewind of tape, and head drum rotation.<br>By providing a dedicated motor for each role without belt transmission, the load on the motor is reduced and the accuracy and stability of tape running are improved.<br><br>The A/D converter is equipped with a newly developed pulse A/D converter with built-in 1-bit modulation. It achieves an excellent signal-to-noise ratio by performing high-speed, high-precision arithmetic with 64 x oversampling and 5th order noise shaping.<br>In addition, it is separated from the decimation filter which performs the digital operation to return the sampling rate, and the independent configuration reduces the influence of noise on the modulator which handles analog signals.<br><br>Equipped with newly developed SBM digital filter with built-in decimation filter and SBM (Super Bit Mapping).<br>In the decimation filter section, high-precision digital calculation of total 213 order is executed, and the original thrust of 120 dB or more is obtained, and the return noise is eliminated.<br>In addition, the SBM unit shifts quantization noise, which is uniformly distributed within the audible band, to higher frequencies, which are difficult to hear, in accordance with the human audibility characteristics, and incorporates low-order 4-bit information, which is normally truncated, into high-order 16-bit information using the principle of noise shaping, thereby achieving significant noise reduction.<br><br>The master clock is installed close to the A/D converter and equipped with an A/D direct sync circuit that sends a high-purity clock signal.<br><br>The D/A converter employs an advanced pulse D/A converter that realizes high-density pulse outputs through the introduction of a proprietary high-precision calculation method. It uses single-chip ICs with single-channel 4D/A-output and double-channel 8D/A-output, and performs complimentary service PLM operation (differential-synthesis of two pulse wave outputs that are complementary to each other) to reduce harmonic distortion.<br>The DTC 2000 es further improves the separation characteristics by using two chips of this advanced pulse D/A converter IC with independent left and right channels.<br><br>In order to minimize magnetic distortion caused by eddy current and reduce circuit impedance, we have adopted a high-rigidity chassis with copper plating inside the chassis. We have also adopted a high-rigidity aluminum top plate for the top plate and ceramic insulators for the legs to further increase the rigidity.<br><br>We have adopted a software servo system that is a substantial software version of the microcomputer controlled motor servo system.<br>As a result, in order to avoid excessive load on the tape, a high-speed and smooth search operation is realized, with slow searching at the beginning and immediately before stopping, and up to 200 times speed (standard time) in the middle of driving.<br>In addition, software servo reduces the sound output time and improves the operability during cue / review operations.<br><br>A third generation LSI is installed in the LSI for digital signal processing such as error correction and digital I/O. This LSI realizes even higher integration density, thereby simplifying the board structure and improving reliability and error correction capability.<br><br>It is equipped with the subcode function which is one of the features of DAT, and it is possible to set and erase start ID, skip ID and end ID.<br>The start ID is a subcode that indicates the beginning of a song. It is equipped with two modes : Auto, which is automatically written at the start of a song, and Manual, which can be written at any position you like (excluding immediately after the start ID, 9 seconds in SP mode, and 18 seconds in LP mode).<br>The skip ID is an ID that is written at the beginning of the part you want to hear when you play the tape. If you find the skip iD during playback, you can automatically forward it to the next start ID.<br>The End ID is a code that considers the part written to be the end of the tape, auto-rewinding for playback and stopping for fast forward.<br><br>It is equipped with a rehearsal function for writing start ID, skip ID / end ID, and point writing of A-B repeat, which are done in the playback manual.<br>During the rehearsal, you can move the point back and forth in 0.3 second increments while listening to and confirming the sound. The movement time is displayed on the display and can be easily written to the Just Point. You can also modify the Start ID that has already been written.<br><br>You can assign a program number to the Start ID, and you can directly select a song by simply specifying the number with the 10 key when you play it. The program number is automatically assigned when you record it or can be changed by changing the number.<br><br>By adding or deleting the start ID, if the program number is not uniform, a renumbering function is incorporated. This function renumbers the number from the beginning of the tape with one touch.<br><br>It is equipped with a shift number function that renumbers the start ID by adding it back in 0.3 second increments.<br><br>It is possible to record the absolute time which shows the absolute time from the tape top.<br><br>Equipped with a date function, the built-in dedicated clock automatically records the year / month / day / day / day of week / hour / minute / second / AM/PM in the subcode part when recording.<br><br>It is equipped with a time search function so that when you are using a tape with absolute time recorded, you can use this function to move the tape forward and backward in minutes to play or find music.<br><br>Equipped with an absolute time search, the target point can be searched quickly by directly inputting the absolute time of the point to be cueed in hours/minutes/seconds with 10 keys.<br><br>AMS play is possible in which you can start the previous or next song depending on the number of times you press AMS based on the song you are listening to.<br>In addition, by using the AMS button and the 10 key together, it is also equipped with AMS search which can find the beginning and end of the number of songs according to the number.<br><br>It is equipped with program number search, and by using 10 key and play button jointly, you can directly find the music which recorded the program number of the number you pressed.<br><br>Equipped with a music scan function, you can search for the start ID one after another and play it for about 8 seconds each.<br>DTC-2000ES also allows you to change the playback time within a range of 1 to 15 seconds.<br><br>Repeat playback of the specified program number and the entire tape is possible.<br>In addition, DTC-2000ES allows A-B repeat between specified points.<br><br>Equipped with end search, you can quickly find an end ID or an unrecorded part that has never been recorded.<br><br>By using the included remote control, you can play 99 RMS songs by rearranging the program numbers in the order you like.<br><br>Continuous recording for up to 4 hours (when using DT 120) is possible.<br><br>Equipped with digital fade in / out, you can fade in / out during recording and playback. The fade in / out time can be set from 1 second to 15 seconds and is linked with the pause function.<br><br>Equipped with 2 types of digital input / output terminals which are coaxial with light. Switching between coaxial with light can be done with a switch on the front panel.<br>The optical input uses a servo-type digital signal normalizer circuit that absorbs jitter caused by cables.<br>In addition, the digital output can be turned OFF in DTC 2000 es.<br><br>Equipped with a digital peak margin display function, it is possible to display in digital units of dB how much memory level is available when recording.<br><br>Equipped with two output terminals, fixed and variable.<br><br>It comes with a wireless remote control that can operate most of the body.<br>You can also select music and pose for Sony&#39;s remote-controlled CD player, and record CD in sync.<br><br>The fs map function using a digital peak level meter allows you to see visually which sampling frequency is being recorded at an approximate location on the tape.<br><br>Equipped with a CD Q-code decoding function, when recording a CD with digital input, it is possible to decode the Q-code, which is information between songs on the digital interface, and automatically write an accurate start ID.</p>
