				<p class="detail">A 2-motor cassette deck that achieves substantial basic performance at an affordable price.<br><br>The Twin Field Super GX head is adopted for the recording / reproducing head.<br>This head uses High and High μ ferrite materials and has a recording gap (4 μ) and a reproducing gap (1 μ) in one head housing to achieve performance suitable for each of them.<br><br>The system is controlled by a microcomputer.<br>The timing control of the motor and plunger is based on the clock pulse generated by the ceramic oscillator of the microcomputer. Compared to conventional logic control, accurate operation with no timing variation or aging variation is realized.<br>In particular, the transfer operation during mode switching is reliable and smooth, so that no excessive force is applied to the tape instantaneously. In addition, the auto-mute timing (4 seconds) is accurately controlled by the microcomputer.<br><br>A newly developed electromagnetic switch is used to switch between recording and playback of the amplifier section.<br>Compared with conventional slide switches, this switch can be set at an ideal position on the board and the wiring pattern can be greatly shortened.<br><br>LED and phototransistor are used to detect tape running.<br><br>Sensor light control is adopted, and mode display by light is performed.<br><br>A 2-motor configuration is used for the mechanism part.<br>An electronically controlled DC-motor with excellent durability and low wow flutter is used for the capstan drive, while a dedicated DC-motor with strong torque is used for the reel drive.<br>High durability has been realized by adopting a simple mechanism.<br><br>Uses newly developed direct function mechanism.<br>This mechanism was developed to stabilize the timing of operations such as Play, FF, RWD and Pause. Two plungers are operated separately and in combination (one is for Play FF RWD and the other is for Play and Pause). This mechanism eliminates the need for a dedicated plunger for Pause and further stabilizes the mechanical operation. By combining this mechanism with a 2-motor system, more accurate and faster operation than before is realized.<br>In addition, a silencer type is used for the plunger, and complete silencing is achieved by combining a damper.<br><br>Equipped with + 3 db and + 7 db peak indicators.<br><br>Equipped with auto-mute mechanism.<br>This function automatically sets a 4-second silent recording and activates the REC standby mode. You can also leave more than 4-second intervals by pressing and holding the button.<br><br>Equipped with a tape selector that also supports metal tapes.<br>GX-F15 supports 3 positions of Normal, CrO2, and Metal.<br><br>Equipped with a Dolby NR system as a noise reduction system.<br>In addition, it is equipped with an MPX filter switch so that it can cut the 19 khz pilot signal which is a problem when recording an FM stereo broadcast transmission with Dolby NR.<br><br>Equipped with timer standby mechanism, recording of absence and alarm clock playback are possible by combining with the separately sold timer.<br><br>Remote control is possible by combining the separately sold remote control unit.</p>
