				<p class="detail">The R Series CD transport has an independent player function that takes out the information recorded on the CD as a digital signal, and has pursued sound quality thoroughly.<br><br>It uses a center mechanical mounting system in which the mechanical deck is placed in the center of the chassis, which is least affected by external vibration. In addition, the mechanism is equipped with a high-rigidity stable-lock mechanism.<br>The Stay-Lock Mechanism eliminates rattling by reducing the size of the components by eliminating excess projections from the components and assembling these components into a mutually constraining structure. In addition, the overall short span design greatly improves vibration resistance and strength against twisting and bending. On top of this, the G base unit and tray are reinforced with glass fiber by adding calcium carbonate of the same composition as marble to the base unit and tray. The G tray, a movable part, is equipped with a tray lock mechanism in which both sides of the tray are fixed to the mechanism block by two lock arms during performance.<br>In addition to this, the top of the mechanical deck is equipped with a 5 mm thick extruded aluminum stabilizer to increase rigidity, and by placing it close to the disk, it acts as an air damper that vibrates the top plate and effectively reduces sound pressure entering the interior.<br><br>The servo circuit is equipped with a GTS servo, which continuously monitors the fluctuation of the pit train on the disk and works to eliminate the rapid fluctuation that the pit train cannot have.<br>This GTS servo has a feature that mechanical noise is extremely small. In addition, since there is no wasteful response to scratches, sound skipping is difficult, and recovery to the pit string after passing through scratches is good, so the amount of information read from the disk increases.<br>In addition, by separating and separating the grind line of the servo circuit with a bus bar, the influence on the ground potential of other circuits is greatly reduced, contributing to improved sound quality.<br><br>The optical disk drive motor is equipped with a 3-phase BSL (brush &amp; slotless) motor.<br>The 3-phase BSL motor, which is structurally less susceptible to vibration, eliminates coking (torque pulsation) and improves stability. In addition, the safety margin of signal reading and servo tracking are improved.<br><br>The CDP-R1a and DAS-R1a use the Twin Link S method, which enables one master clock, in order to realize a more complete separate type.<br>Apart from the data tradition from the player side to the converter, it is equipped with an interface that sends a clock signal from the converter side to the player. This is structured so that both units are connected by two optical cables in a round trip, and data read from the disk can be sent out in synchronization with the movement of the D/A converter.<br><br>The characteristics are improved by installing a low-jitter optical output unit.<br><br>FB chassis is adopted for the chassis structure.<br>This chassis is made of metal material of sufficient thickness and strength, and the whole chassis is joined by a frame surrounding the outer circumference and beams before and after passing the front and rear. This structure ensures almost total strength only by this frame and beams.<br>It is fixed directly on the most neutral beam with low vibration without using any special metal fittings when mounting the mechanism and substrate.<br>In the CDP-R1a, the mass of the block is increased by fixing the large-weight power transformer on the same beam as the mechanical deck with anti-vibration measures. This is combined with the center mechanical mounting method to obtain a good weight balance, which simplifies the vibration moment and prevents the chassis from rotating.<br>The legs are made of fine ceramic insulators combined with rubber with good braking performance.<br><br>A 2-transformer configuration is used for the power supply for digital servo independently and exclusively.<br>The CDP-R1a uses a twin core transformer that houses two transformers in one transformer case, and two transformers of the same size are arranged side by side to prevent mechanical tuning fork resonance.<br><br>The front panel is designed to be as simple as possible, and only the minimum necessary functions related to play operation are arranged. Functions such as program performance are performed by the attached remote control.<br>In addition to basic operations such as play / stop, the included remote control allows direct selection, program performance of up to 20 songs, shuffle / delete shuffle performance with randomly rearranged songs, repeat performance in 6 modes, etc. It also includes a program bank for storing the order of programmed songs, and a custom index for placing the original index in the desired part of a song.<br><br>Equipped with an automatic timer start function that can start playing automatically by combination of external timers.</p>
