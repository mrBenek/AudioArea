				<p class="detail">This is a D. D. player system that adopts a full auto mechanism with enhanced safety.<br><br>Auto lead-In, Auto Cut, Auto Repeat, etc. can be performed by operating the front panel. You can start and stop playing with the dust cover closed. Switching to manual operation is also possible.<br><br>Equipped with an arm limiter mechanism that protects the mechanism by releasing the auto mechanism even if the arm during auto operation is stopped by hand.<br><br>The motor is a linear BSL motor that does not require a brush or slot. This reduces torque unevenness and realizes quiet and smooth rotation. Moreover, high torque is obtained due to high efficiency, and reliability and durability are also improved.<br><br>A magne-disk speed detection system is used for the speed detection part of the servo circuit.<br>The multi-gap head detects the average value of the detection signal, which is densely magnetized on the turntable, and captures minute changes in the rotational frequency. 33 Since the generated signal has a high frequency of approximately 284 Hz at 1/3rpm, servo compensation is possible up to relatively high frequencies of the flutter components.<br><br>The speed signal obtained by the magnet-disk speed detection is compared with the reference signal and controlled to maintain the correct rotational speed. However, the temperature characteristics of the element used in this case may affect accurate servo control. To solve this problem, we have adopted a crystal lock that controls the phase of the detected signal.<br>By taking advantage of the high oscillation precision of quartz crystal, stable rotational characteristics that are resistant to changes in ambient temperature, power supply voltage and frequency are obtained.<br><br>In the tone arm part, the connection of each connection part is strengthened and integration is promoted as much as possible to eliminate resonance.<br>In order to prevent the gap between the ball bearings in the bearings section from causing play and to prevent the operating point of the arm from blurring, we have adopted a Longs pan bearing shaft supported by a single straight shaft with a long distance between four points. This minimizes the movement of the operating point against slight play of the bearing section.<br><br>Uses XL-15, which is a MM type cartridge.<br><br>The cabinet uses an acoustic material, SBMC, which is less likely to resonate than metals and has high precision and strength. Partial resonance is suppressed by considering the thickness and structure in a comprehensive manner and reinforcing the structure at important points.<br>In addition, a thick and strong dust cover has been adopted to improve vibration damping characteristics.<br><br>Gel-like dump material is enclosed in the insulator to realize effective vibration absorption.</p>
