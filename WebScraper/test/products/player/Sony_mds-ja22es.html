				<p class="detail">ES series MD deck adopting newly developed Type-R DSP for ATRAC.<br><br>In addition to the ATRAC DSP, which is the core of adaptive high-frequency control technology to improve signal processing, we have installed a Shinkai Type-R DSP with twice the signal processing capability. We also fully utilize the increased processing power provided by the newly developed intelligent bit rear-location algorithm to reanalyze music data and thoroughly search for minute levels of redundant bit allocation that were previously difficult to detect. This allows for better bit allocation and better reproducibility of the source signal because it is redistributed preferentially to the frequency band that is important for hearing.<br>In addition, each step of the calculation process has been revised to achieve extremely high precision calculation.<br><br>We have introduced wide bit stream technology by adopting Type-R DSP for ATRAC. By changing input / output to 24 bits and expanding the operation word length, recording and playback with a wide dynamic range of 20-bit equivalent precision exceeding the 16-bit MD format is possible.<br><br>The newly developed S-TACT IC is used for the pulse generator. This realizes the separation and independence of the noise shaping (digital part) and pulse generation (analog part) which were conventionally composed of only one IC. The IC is composed of only a pulse generation circuit and a clock generation circuit, thereby suppressing the effect of digital noise on the time axis direction of the pulse.<br><br>It is equipped with a sampling rate converter that automatically converts 32 kHz and 48 kHz sampling frequency to 44.1 kHz.<br><br>The D/A converter uses the current pulse D/A converter used in Sony&#39;s ES series CD players.<br>It is transmitted by replacing it with a current that is output as a voltage and is less affected by pulse voltage noise. It has a stable current source and is not affected by voltage fluctuations, making it possible to achieve excellent low-frequency reproduction.<br><br>The power supply section uses an R-core transformer with no breaks in the iron core of the transformer and a circular doughnut type in cross section to greatly reduce magnetic flux leakage and vibration.<br><br>By adopting a slant (non-parallel) mounting substrate, resonance is greatly reduced by suppressing sound pressure applied to the substrate.<br><br>The chassis structure is made of metal material with sufficient strength and thickness. The FB chassis is firmly consolidated into a single box with a frame surrounding the periphery and beams passed in front and back.<br>By combining members of different shapes and sizes, natural vibrations are mutually cancelled, and vibration of the chassis as a whole is greatly reduced.<br><br>A low center of gravity center tray loading system is adopted for disk loading.<br>The tray loading section and base unit section are floating with an insulator and a compression coil spring. In addition, the mold for holding the base unit section is made of a material with excellent vibration damping characteristics called PBT to reduce vibration and improve signal reading accuracy.<br><br>Uses an eccentric insulator whose mounting hole to the chassis is offset from the center.<br>As a result, the vibrations transmitted from the outside cancel each other, making it difficult for them to be transmitted to the chassis. In particular, it is effective in attenuating the vibration components in the middle and high range that affect the sense of hearing.<br><br>Equipped with digital REC level control, the gain can be controlled from - ∞ dB to + 12 dB at the center of gain 0 dB.<br>It also has a built-in memory function that can store the set recording level for each input channel.<br><br>Equipped with a variable (V. C. = Variable Coefficient) digital filter that allows subtle sound changes to be obtained by changing the cutoff characteristics of the digital filter during MD playback.<br>There are four preset positions for the variable digital filter, so you can adjust the sound quality according to your preference.<br><br>Equipped with a pitch control function, you can listen at different playback speeds from -98.5% to + 12.5%.<br><br>It is equipped with a music sync function. When you press the music sync button on the remote control and the connected device starts playing, it senses the input of a music signal and automatically starts recording.<br><br>It is equipped with a time machine recording function. If you press the multi-jog dial in the recording pause state, the sound recorded on the disc is traced back to the sound of up to 6 seconds before.<br><br>Equipped with a monaural recording and playback function that allows the disc to be used twice as long as the display.<br><br>It has a TOC EDTI function that allows you to divide, combine, and move songs. It also has an UNDO function that allows you to cancel the last edit and redo it.<br>It is also equipped with a rehearsal function so that you can make decisions while checking edit points in COMBINE or DIVIDE. You can move edit points finely by minute, second, or frame (approximately 0.01 second).<br><br>Equipped with the A-B ERASE function that allows you to easily erase between two specified points in a song.<br><br>It is equipped with a title function that can record up to 1,700 characters of disc names and song titles on the disc.<br>In addition to conventional alphabets, numbers and symbols, katakana characters can also be input, and input can be done from the main body or remote controller.<br><br>It is equipped with a smart space function that automatically adjusts silence periods of 3 seconds or more to approximately 3 seconds during digital recording.<br><br>Equipped with a timer standby function that enables recording and playback by combining a timer sold separately.<br><br>Equipped with a 2-digit FL display that displays track name and elapsed time, disc name and track name, track name and program step separately in two upper and lower columns.<br><br>Equipped with the Control A1 connector, you can use the REC IT function to easily record from CD to MD and the CD TEXT copy function in combination with a CD player with the Control A1 connector.<br><br>Connection with a PC is possible by using MD-PC link kit PCLK-MD1 (sold separately).<br>By using this function, basic operation of MD deck, editing of disc, character input, etc. can be done from PC.<br><br>The SCMS (Serial Copy Management System) allows digital recording only for one generation and does not allow digital recording for two or more generations.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
