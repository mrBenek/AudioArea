				<p class="detail">This cassette deck is based on TC-K555ESX and has further improved sound quality by improving high-frequency resolution through a large shift up of bias frequency.<br><br>The midship drive system is used to completely eliminate unwanted vibrations that pollute the sound.<br>The mechanical deck and power supply unit are located in the center of the chassis, and the operation control system and audio circuit are separated on both left and right sides. This achieves a good weight balance with almost equal weight on the four legs.<br>In addition, by dividing the inside of the chassis into three equal parts by a U-shaped inner chassis, total rigidity is increased, and a rigid structure with high vibration resistance is obtained. Electromagnetic interference between each block is eliminated.<br><br>The mechanism section employs a closed-loop dual capstan system, which stabilizes tape running, improves wow and flutter characteristics, reduces modulation noise, and provides stable head touch.<br>The capstan drive employs a direct drive with a 3-phase linear torque BSL motor with less rotational unevenness, and achieves excellent characteristics by using a quartz lock servo.<br><br>It employs a super-bias that greatly increases the bias frequency. By expanding the frequency difference with the music signal, beat noise and current modulation distortion are reduced, and resolution in the high-frequency range is improved.<br><br>An amorphous laser head with LC-OFC winding is used for the head. In addition, accurate azimuth accuracy of each recording / reproducing head is obtained, and the ability of the head is brought out by the adoption of independent suspension 3 head system with uniform head touch.<br><br>In the audio circuit, the recording amplifier and the playback amplifier are arranged on two separate boards with a sufficient distance between them to eliminate interference between the recording and re-amplifiers. In addition, interference between channels is reduced by using an all-stage L/R twin mono DC amplifier configuration.<br><br>It is equipped with a calibration function. The built-in oscillator allows you to precisely adjust the recording bias and recording level. The meter also switches to adjustment mode.<br><br>The high-frequency characteristics of the recording equalizer can be switched to three levels.<br><br>It is equipped with a wide-range peak program meter that can display peak hold and real-time peak values simultaneously and further improve visibility.<br><br>Equipped with linear electronic counter with subtraction function.<br><br>Equipped with Dolby NR / B-C type.<br><br>Equipped with a memory stop / play function.<br><br>Equipped with Type I/II/IV auto tape selector.<br><br>Equipped with Rec Mute function with auto space.<br><br>Equipped with a slack prevention mechanism during cassette loading.<br><br>The timer sold separately allows continuous recording and alarm clock playback.<br><br>Equipped with a gold plated headphone port with volume.<br><br>Side wood is attached.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
