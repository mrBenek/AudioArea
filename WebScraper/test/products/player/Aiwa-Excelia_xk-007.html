				<p class="detail">Stereo cassette deck with AMTS and PC-OCC winding.<br><br>Equipped with an AMTS (Amti Modulation Tape Stabilizer) to reduce vibration of the cassette half.<br>In the AMTS, the cassette box is made of a two layer structure consisting of a non-magnetic aluminum plate and a non-resilient special rubber that has been thoroughly examined in terms of sound quality. The half body of the cassette box is accurately and securely clamped at a pressure of approximately 1 kg, greatly reducing modulation noise and tape running noise.<br><br>Equipped with super-stabilized tension dual capstan mechanism.<br>This mechanism employs a frequency-separated dual capstan that eliminates frequency overlap by changing the diameters of the two capstan shafts and prevents resonance. In addition, by applying Aiwa&#39;s unique micrograin processing to the capstan, the capstan surface is processed into fine grains to prevent tape slippage and reduce degradation of the tape and capstan itself.<br><br>The head block uses a 30g heavy weight zinc die-cast head block to reduce modulation noise by suppressing fine head vibration.<br>In addition, a bias shield is set in the head block to prevent bias leakage from the recording head wire to the reproducing head wire and signal leakage.<br><br>The recording and reproducing heads are made of high-hardness permalloy, and PC-OCC winding is used.<br><br>In the dual capstan mechanism, a higher constant tape tension is applied than in the single capstan mechanism, which increases the adhesion between the tape and the head. Therefore, when a normal ferrite material is used for the erase head, the high frequency degradation of the tape signal is caused by the spontaneous magnetization effect due to the coercive force = Hc (0.1 to 0.15) of the ferrite material. Therefore, a Sendust head with a low Hc of 0.007 to 0.02 is used for the erase head.<br><br>Equipped with Dolby HX Pro, which improves the high-frequency dynamic range and frequency characteristics during recording.<br>In the Dolby HX Pro, music components are calculated at 1/1000 second intervals, and the bias amount is controlled so as to keep the optimum amount of bias at all times. This is effective in improving the high-frequency dynamic range and the f characteristic.<br><br>Equipped with a manual calibration function, it is possible to adjust the optimum bias value and recording sensitivity for each tape while switching between source and monitor.<br><br>A direct input terminal for CD/DAT is installed in addition to the input terminal via amplifier.<br><br>The power supply section uses a separate winding power transformer with separate windings for mechanical logic and signal systems.<br>In addition, the transformer itself is designed to be vibration-proof with epoxy filler. Moreover, by setting the transformer outside the main body, adverse effects of flux and micro vibration generated by the power transformer on the tape head and signal system are eliminated.<br><br>The printed circuit boards for the mechanical logic system, display system and signal system are separated from each other, and an independent separation structure is adopted in which they are installed with sufficient space.<br>The mechanical logic system and the display system are isolated from each other by an internal chassis to eliminate interference with the signal system. Moreover, the recording system and the reproduction system are completely separated from each other to prevent the effects of the recording system signal and high-frequency bias during recording on the reproduction system. In addition, the reproduction system substrate is firmly fixed with two special holders and six special screws with flanges to prevent deterioration of sound quality caused by external vibration.<br><br>All stages of the signal circuit are DC amplifier configuration, and simple and straight signal transmission is achieved by eliminating connectors, analog switches and switching circuits that are harmful to sound quality as much as possible.<br>Interference between channels is also eliminated by the independent configuration of the left and right channels.<br><br>It is equipped with a transmission mechanism that does not cause sound quality degradation when turned off, such as an MPX circuit with through position and an open-type muting circuit during performance.<br><br>Equipped with dual Dolby B/C type as a noise reduction system.<br><br>Equipped with a large insulator.<br><br>The playback amplifier uses a direct-coupling differential input DC configuration equalizer amplifier, and is directly input to the playback amplifier via a PC-OCC wire.<br><br>It is equipped with a peak meter with 24 segments x2ch peak hold.<br><br>It is equipped with a linear counter that digitally displays the tape running in minutes and seconds, and a pre-end indicator that notifies the end of the tape when recording.<br><br>It uses MPX filter and bias trap filter that uses PC-OCC winding and low-distortion core.<br><br>Equipped with a quick review / queue function.<br><br>The headphone terminal is gold-plated.<br><br>Wireless remote control is included.</p>
